Meta's threat to close down Facebook and Instagram in Europe backfires as EU leaders embrace shutdown: 'Life would be very good without',https://www.cityam.com/metas-threat-to-close-down-facebook-and-instagram-in-europe-backfires-as-eu-leaders-embrace-shutdown-life-would-be-very-good-without/,nottheonion,"Meta’s threat to close down Facebook and Instagram in Europe backfires as EU leaders embrace shutdown: ‘Life would be very good without’

European leaders have embraced Meta’s indirect warning to shut down its Facebook and Instagram operations across Europe if the social media giant is no longer able to process Europeans’ data on US servers.

Last night, Germany’s new economy minister Robert Habeck told reporters during a meeting in Paris: “After I was hacked I have lived without Facebook and Twitter for four years and life has been fantastic.

Speaking alongside his German colleague, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire added: “I can confirm that life would be very good without Facebook and that we would live very well without Facebook.”

“Digital giants must understand that the European continent will resist and affirm its sovereignty.” French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire

The two leaders commented on Meta’ statement that if it is not given the option to transfer, store and process data from its European users on US-based servers, Facebook and Instagram may be shut down across Europe.

The social media giants’ owner reportedly warned in its annual report that the key issue for Meta is transatlantic data transfers, regulated via the so-called Privacy Shield and other model agreements that Meta uses or used to store data from European users on American servers.

In a recent report to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Meta warned that if a data transfer framework is not adopted and the company is no longer allowed to use the current model agreements “or alternatives,” the company will “probably” no longer be able to offer many of its “most significant products and services,” including Facebook and Instagram, in the EU, according to various media reports.

Sharing data between countries and regions is crucial for the provision of its services and targeted advertising, Meta stressed. The current agreements to enable data transfers are currently under heavy scrutiny in the EU.

Therefore, it previously used the transatlantic data transfer framework called Privacy Shield as the legal basis to carry out those data transfers.

However, this treaty was annulled by the European Court of Justice in July 2020, because of data protection violations.

Since then, the EU and the US did stress they are working on a new or updated version of the treaty.

When approached by City A.M., a spokesperson for Meta said: “We have absolutely no desire and no plans to withdraw from Europe, but the simple reality is that Meta, and many other businesses, organisations and services, rely on data transfers between the EU and the US in order to operate global services.”

“We are closely monitoring the potential impact on our European operations as these developments progress.” A Meta spokesperson speaking to City A.M.

“Like other companies, we have followed European rules and rely on Standard Contractual Clauses, and appropriate data safeguards, to operate a global service,” he added.

“Fundamentally, businesses need clear, global rules to protect transatlantic data flows over the long term”

“Like more than 70 other companies across a wide range of industries, we are closely monitoring the potential impact on our European operations as these developments progress,” he concluded.

Pregnant Texas woman driving in HOV lane told police her unborn child counted as a passenger,https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Pregnant-Texas-woman-driving-in-HOV-lane-told-17293221.php,nottheonion,"Is an unborn fetus a human being in the eyes of...Texas traffic laws?

A pregnant Dallas-area woman argued as much to police officers after recently being cited for driving alone in the HOV lane, according to a story published Friday afternoon by the Dallas Morning News' Dave Lieber.

Lieber reports that Plano resident Brandy Bettone was driving along U.S. Highway 75 en route to picking up her son when she found herself at a checkpoint facing a citation for using the high-occupancy vehicle lane while alone in her car.

""I was driving to pick up my son. I knew I couldn't be a minute late, so I took the HOV lane,"" Bettone told Lieber. ""As I exited the HOV, there was a checkpoint at the end of the exit. I slammed on my brakes and I was pulled over by police.""

Bettone said officers asked her if there were any more occupants inside her vehicle. Pregnant with a daughter, Bettone told the officers her unborn child was inside the vehicle with her, according to Lieber.

""I pointed to my stomach and said, 'My baby girl is right here. She is a person,'"" Bettone said. However the officers were not buying it. ""He said, 'Oh, no. It's got to be two people outside of the body.'""

Bettone spoke with multiple officers over the course of her encounter, she told Lieber. One seemed indifferent, Bettone claimed, while another gave her a citation and told her to challenge it in court to have it thrown out.

""One kind of brushed me off when I mentioned this is a living child, according to everything that's going on with the overturning of Roe v. Wade. 'So I don't know why you're not seeing that,' I said,"" Bettone explained. ""He was like, 'I don't want to deal with this....Ma'am, it means two persons outside of the body.""

Bettone ended up receiving a $215 citation and instructions from the issuing officer suggesting that if she fought it, it would most likely get dropped. According to Lieber, the Dallas County Sheriff Department has declined to issue a statement on Bettone's citation or pregnancy defense.

In Texas, all abortions are now illegal following the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe and pending enactment of state trigger laws on the practice. Prior to the high court's ruling, all abortions past six weeks of pregnancy had been outlawed by the Texas Heartbeat Act. This prior measure had been modeled closely after language crafted by Christian anti-abortion group Faith2Action Ministries, which has defined the presence of a fetal heartbeat as a marker of ""an unborn human individual,"" according to The Texas Tribune.

Bettone said she does not plan to pay her fine for the incident.

""I will be fighting it,"" she said."
Mark Zuckerberg Says Meta Employees “Lovingly” Refer to Him as “The Eye of Sauron”,https://consequence.net/2022/04/mark-zuckerberg-eye-of-sauron/,nottheonion,"Mark Zuckerberg hasn’t always had a squeaky-clean reputation, and the Facebook/Meta founder and CEO has accrued a slew of less-than-flattering nicknames throughout his career. But during his recent appearance on The Tim Ferriss Show, he shared a particularly eyebrow-raising label given to him by his own employees: The Eye of Sauron.

Zuckerberg brought up the moniker after he and Ferriss began discussing how he manages his energy in the workplace while constantly being barraged with news and information. “Maybe I’m not strong-willed enough or calm enough to do just straight-up meditation,” Zuck said. “I actually need to put myself in a situation where it’s difficult to not focus on that thing.”

He continued: “Some of the folks I work with at the company — they say this lovingly — but I think that they sometimes refer to my attention as the Eye of Sauron. You have this unending amount of energy to go work on something, and if you point that at any given team, you will just burn them.”

For those who haven’t travelled to Middle-earth in a couple of Ages, the Eye of Sauron is a manifestation of the titular Lord of the Rings. Without delving too deeply into fantasy lore, it is canonically nefarious, and bad things happen when it notices you. Zuckerberg’s computer nerd demeanor doesn’t quite scream “Dark Lord” to us, but we don’t deny that Meta employees would compare his semi-autocratic mode of operation to that of the Eye. Either way, we’re not so sure that’s a compliment, Mark. See Zuck’s full interview with Tim Ferriss below, with the relevant section beginning around 20:10.

Speaking of malevolent campaigns, Facebook recently hired a GOP firm to launch a prolonged smear attack on TikTok. This act of corporate vindictiveness escalated after Facebook lost users for the first time ever. In slightly less distressing news, the company blocked access in Russia last month in response to the country’s invasion of Ukraine."
Police didn't immediately confront the gunman as Texas school shooting unfolded because they 'could've been shot',https://www.insider.com/texas-shooting-police-didnt-immediately-confront-gunman-lieutenant-explains-2022-5,nottheonion,"Law enforcement is getting slammed for its response to the Uvalde school shooting as it unfolded.

Police waited for Border Patrol before confronting the gunman, officials said.

Law-enforcement officers did not immediately confront the gunman as the shooting at Robb Elementary School unfolded because they ""could've been shot,"" a Texas Department of Public Safety official told CNN on Thursday.

Local and state authorities responding to the deadly shooting in Uvalde, Texas, on Tuesday had waited for a US Border Patrol tactical team to arrive to take out the gunman, officials previously said.

It remains unclear how long they waited, though officials said Wednesday that roughly 40 minutes to an hour had passed between the time the shooter entered the school and was shot and killed by a Border Patrol agent.

Texas DPS Lieutenant Chris Olivarez told CNN on Thursday: ""The active shooter situation, you want to stop the killing, you want to preserve life, but also one thing that — of course, the American people need to understand that officers are making entry into this building. They do not know where the gunman is.""

""At that point, if they pursued it any further — not knowing where the suspect was at — they could've been shot, they could've been killed and, at that point, that gunman would have the opportunity to kill other people inside that school.""

Officials have been trying to piece together an exact timeline of how the shooting, which left 19 children and two adult, unfolded, and how law enforcement reacted.

They have faced mounting criticism for the slow response time, with policing experts saying that a greater sense of urgency from them could have saved lives.

Bystanders and parents who were outside the school when the shooting unfolded said they were so frustrated with police that they considered storming the building themselves.

One mother ended up jumping the school fence and running inside the building herself to grab her two children, The Wall Street Journal reported. The woman told The Journal she did so because officers were ""doing nothing.""

""They were just standing outside the fence,"" she told The Wall Street Journal. ""They weren't going in there or running anywhere."""

Add gorillas to the list of creatures intimidated by Shaquille O'Neal's enormous size.

During a recent episode of ""The Big Podcast with Shaq,"" the former NBA big man explained that gorillas freak out when he shows up at zoos and that they want to fight him. Shaq even called an executive from Zoo Miami during the podcast who confirmed the tale.

The conversation came up when Shaq was contemplating whether to let his gray hair grow out, joking that he would be a ""silverback"" gorilla and not a ""silver fox.""

This led to Shaq, a huge zoo aficionado, explaining how gorillas react to his size when he shows up.

""True story,"" Shaq said. ""I've been to every zoo in the world, and every time I go to the gorilla section, they look at me like, 'Hey man, where your fur at?' For real. For real. That's how they look at me. They also look at me like, 'What am I doing in here and you out there?' And they always go crazy when they see me.""

Shaq, who is 7 feet 1, 325 pounds, then called the animal expert Ron Magill, the communications director for Zoo Miami. Magill is also a bit of a ""zookeeper to the stars"" and a celebrity in his own right.

Magill not only confirmed the story but also took it a step further by explaining that the male gorillas are intimidated by Shaq.

The gorilla ""gets intimated, and he looks at Shaq and thinks that Shaq is going to take away his girls, and he gets tight-lipped and tries to stand up and make himself look as big as possible,"" Magill said. ""But at the end of the day, he backs off. He knows who's boss.""

Shaq then added that it is the same at every zoo.

""Every zoo in the world they go crazy,"" Shaq said. ""They try to break out the damn thing and try to fight me.""

You can listen to Shaq's initial comments at the 2:30 mark in the episode below and Magill's story at the 7:05 mark."
Ye escorted out of Skechers office in Los Angeles after he showed up unannounced,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/26/ye-escorted-out-of-skechers-office-in-los-angeles-after-he-showed-up-unannounced.html,nottheonion,"Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, was escorted out of the Los Angeles office of shoemaker Skechers , the company said Wednesday afternoon, as the fallen rapper and fashion mogul continues to face fallout from his recent antisemitic remarks.

Ye showed up unannounced and was escorted out of the building by two executives, the company said. Ye has officially changed his name from Kanye West.

""Skechers is not considering and has no intention of working with West. We condemn his recent divisive remarks and do not tolerate antisemitism or any other form of hate speech,"" the company said in a statement. ""The Company would like to again stress that West showed up unannounced and uninvited to Skechers corporate offices.""

First Patient to Communicate Via Brain Implant Asks to Hear TOOL Album,https://lambgoat.com/news/35907/first-patient-to-communicate-via-brain-implant-asks-to-hear-tool-album/,nottheonion,"In the first study of its kind, scientists were able to communicate with a late-stage ALS patient using a brain implant and neural signals. Among the few requests he painstakingly communicated was a desire to listen to a Tool album (and loudly).

As it progresses, the devastating neurological disease that is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) can rob sufferers of their ability to communicate. Eventually, they can no longer speak. Later, they can't even use an eye-tracking camera to share their thoughts. If they remain alive long enough, they might be unable to communicate for weeks, months, or even years.

According to Science.org, a 36-year-old man with ALS started working with a research team at Germany's University of Tübingen in 2018 when he could still move his eyes. At the time, he expressed his desire to undergo an invasive implantation procedure in order to continue communicating with his family. After his wife and sister consented to the surgery, researchers inserted electrode arrays into the portion of the brain that controls movement.

Following several months of unsuccessful efforts to effectively communicate with the patient, the team turned to neurofeedback, a process during which Science.org says ""a person attempts to modify their brain signals while getting a real-time measure of whether they are succeeding."""
George W Bush accidentally condemns 'unjustified and brutal' Iraq invasion,https://news.sky.com/story/george-w-bush-accidentally-condemns-unjustified-and-brutal-iraq-invasion-12616449,nottheonion,"George W Bush has accidentally condemned the ""unjustified and brutal invasion of Iraq"", an operation he ordered himself in 2003.

The former US president, 75, quickly corrected himself to say he had meant to refer to Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

He made the gaffe during a speech in Texas on Wednesday in which he took aim at Russia's political system.

Mr Bush told the audience in the city of Dallas: ""Russian elections are rigged, political opponents are imprisoned or otherwise eliminated from participating in the electoral process.

""The result is an absence of checks and balances in Russia, and the decision of one man to launch a wholly unjustified and brutal invasion of Iraq.""

He then corrected himself and shook his head.

""I mean, of Ukraine,"" he said, before jokingly blaming the blunder on his age, muttering ""I'm 75"" as the audience burst into laughter.

Footage of the mishap has been watched more than 10 million times on Twitter after it was shared by Michael Williams, a reporter from Dallas News who was at the event.

Ohio bill would allow pregnant people to sue men for unintended pregnancies,https://news.wosu.org/politics-government/2022-07-07/ohio-bill-would-allow-pregnant-people-to-sue-men-for-unintended-pregnancies,nottheonion,"With Ohio’s new six-week abortion ban in place, a Democratic state lawmaker says it’s time for the Ohio Legislature to give consideration to her bill that holds men, who cause an unintended pregnancy, responsible whether the sex that led to the pregnancy was consensual or not.

Sen. Tina Maharath (D-Canal Winchester) said her bill would allow anyone who becomes pregnant to file a civil suit against the person who impregnated them — even if it happened as a result of consensual sex.

“Regardless of the circumstances. I felt it was important to have that vague language due to the fact that abortion is now banned here in the state of Ohio,” Maharath said.

The bill has little to no chance of receiving a committee hearing or passing in the Republican-lead Ohio Senate.

Maharath’s bill would allow the court could order a person who it determines causes a pregnancy to pay damages of not less than $5,000 plus court costs and attorney fees.

Ohio's new ban on abortions — commonly called the ""heartbeat"" law — takes effect as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, at the point fetal activity can be detected. Maharath said the existence of the new law makes it more important that people who become pregnant have the option to file a civil suit against the person who impregnated them, regardless of how it happened.

Maharath said she was disturbed by a recent news story in which a 10-year-old pregnant girl was denied an abortion in Ohio and was forced to drive to Indianapolis to get one. She said many women don't even know they are pregnant at that point.

""The urgency comes because, at six weeks, not everybody knows that, especially if you are 10 years old and pregnant. At 10-years old, you don't know too much about your reproductive rights,"" Maharath said.

A group of Democratic lawmakers have introduced a package of legislation that they say will help parents afford the costs of raising infants and children in the state.

The bills address several issues such as eliminating the sales taxes families pay for diapers and creating a one-time $600 Infant Formula Tax Credit to help families afford those items.

Maharath's bill has yet to have a hearing in a Senate committee, but Republican lawmakers have said they intend to pass a complete ban on abortion when they come back into session in November.

uh what what what's your message for voters of color who are concerned that without the john Lewis voting rights act, they're not gonna be able to vote in the midterm? Well, the concern is misplaced because if you look at the statistics african american voters are voting in just as hard percentage as americans. A recent survey, 94% of Americans thought it was easy to vote. This is not a problem. Turnout is up the biggest turnout since 1900. Um it's simply they're being sold a bill of goods to support A democratic effort to federalize elections. That Senator Blunt pointed out, this goes back 20 years. The excuse has changed from time to time, but this has been a Democratic Party goal for decades. If republicans take back control of Congress after the midterms, what would be your agenda? That is a very good question. And I'll let you know when we take it back uh in the meantime, what the election this fall is going to be about. It's about this administration and how it's doing on inflation, on border security, on foreign policy, on standing up to the Russians. This midterm election will be a report card on the performance of this entire democratic government, the president, the House and the Senate. And in the course of the campaign, various republican candidates will come out for what they would do, what they're for. That's always an important part of every election. But make no mistake about it the election this fall, there's a referendum on this all Democratic government

After the U.S. Senate was unable to push through voting legislation Wednesday night, Republican leader Mitch McConnell is receiving his share of criticism for remarks he made about African American voters.McConnell, one of Kentucky's U.S. senators and the minority leader in the Senate, has been trending on social media since the comment he made Wednesday night after Democrats were unable to move the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act to the Senate floor. Democrats in the Senate fell short of the 60 votes needed to advance the bill over the Republican filibuster.And while Democrats made their own headlines about not being able to change Senate rules to get the voting legislation passed, many are denouncing McConnell for his words that suggested African Americans are not Americans.""Well, the concern is misplaced. Because if you look at the statistics, African American voters are voting in just as high a percentage as Americans,"" McConnell said.Voting legislation fails: Voting bill collapses, Democrats unable to change Senate filibuster rulesU.S. Senate candidate Charles Booker, a former Kentucky lawmaker who is looking to unseat Republican Rand Paul, shared the video on Twitter with a direct criticism of McConnell. The video on his post was viewed more than 1 million times.""I need you to understand that this is who Mitch McConnell is,"" Booker said on Twitter.The tweet included this: ""Being Black doesn't make you less of an American, no matter what this craven man thinks.""Others on social have also come out against McConnell for his comment. That includes Mary Trump, the daughter of Fred Trump and former President Donald Trump's niece. Various other figures and publications have also shared the video.WLKY reached out to McConnell for a statement, but did not hear back.The comment from McConnell and the failure to pass the legislation Wednesday comes as voting rights advocates have been warning that Republican-led states nationwide are passing laws making it more difficult for Black Americans and others to vote by consolidating polling locations, requiring certain types of identification and ordering other changes.In Texas, it's now a crime for election workers to send absentee ballot applications to voters who didn't request them. In Georgia, most voters who show up at the wrong polling places on Election Day will be turned away — instead of permitted to cast provisional ballots.And in Florida, a new law makes it harder for voters to continue receiving ballots by mail and limits the availability of drop boxes.Continuing coverage: Here's what the federal voting proposals would doThe Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act would have made Election Day a national holiday, ensure access to early voting and mail-in ballots — which have become especially popular during the COVID-19 pandemic — and enable the Justice Department to intervene in states with a history of voter interference, among other changes. It has passed the House.The chief goal, supporters say: Make it easier for all Americans — regardless of which states they live in — to vote.""I am profoundly disappointed that the Senate has failed to stand up for our democracy. I am disappointed — but I am not deterred,"" President Joe Biden said in a tweet minutes after the vote."
Texas Gov. excludes gun control from special session on school shootings,https://www.axios.com/2022/06/01/texas-greg-abbott-gun-violence-solutions,nottheonion,"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) has asked state lawmakers in a new letter to find solutions to ""prevent future school shootings"" — but gun control isn't among the items mentioned as areas of focus.

Why it matters: Abbott's letter comes one week after a mass shooting at a Texas elementary school that killed 19 children and two teachers.

Details: On Wednesday, Abbott sent a joint letter to Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick and Speaker Dade Phelan asking for Texas legislative leaders to gather for a special session and develop recommendations for school safety, mental health, social media, police training and firearm safety as a way to ""prevent future school shootings.""

Congress has faced pressure to act on gun control following the Uvalde school shooting, Axios' Alayna Treene reports.

What he said: ""As Texans mourn the tragedy that occurred at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde last week, we as a state must reassess the twin issues of school safety and mass violence,"" Abbott said in the letter.

""As leaders, we must come together at this time to provide solutions to protect all Texans.""

The big picture: Only a few Republican officials have said they are open to further restrictions on guns in the wake of Uvalde."

A Rochester, New York police officer was placed on administrative duty after he arrested an EMT who reportedly hit his police car with an ambulance door.

The incident took place on Monday at Strong Memorial Hospital where the unnamed Rochester Police Department investigator was parked in an ambulance bay – typically reserved for ambulances only – before going into the hospital to respond to a case, News10NBC reported.

An ambulance pulled into the bay, and the EMT got out to transport the patient, at which point she hit the police car with her door, News10 reported.

The investigator ""insisted"" on identifying the EMT, who ""insisted on bringing the patient"" into the hospital, News10's Jennifer Lewke said on Twitter.

A 24-second clip of surveillance footage shared by Lewke shows the investigator slamming the EMT against a hospital wall as she stands by the patient on a stretcher. The investigator cuffs the EMT and walks her out of the hospital.

A spokesperson for the ambulance company, Monroe Ambulance, said their ""highly valued employee"" was ""put in an untenable situation.""

""We steadfastly stand by her prioritization of the care for her patient and are blessed by your willingness to publicly support her patient advocacy,"" the company said in a statement to News10.

The EMT was released from police custody without being ticketed or charged, according to the outlet.

Rochester Police Chief David Smith said in a statement to News10 that he ""immediately directed an internal investigation"" of the investigator.

""The member involved has been re-assigned to administrative duties, pending the results of this investigation. As Chief, I demand the members of the Rochester Police Department perform their duties in a professional manner. And as such, we must hold ourselves to a high standard of accountability,"" Smith said in a statement.

The City of Rochester Police Accountability Board is also reviewing the incident, News10 reported."
"J.K. Rowling's new book, about a transphobe who faces wrath online, raises eyebrows",https://www.npr.org/2022/08/31/1120299781/jk-rowling-new-book-the-ink-black-heart,nottheonion,"J.K. Rowling's new book, about a character accused of transphobia, raises eyebrows

Enlarge this image toggle caption Tolga Akmen/AFP via Getty Images Tolga Akmen/AFP via Getty Images

J.K. Rowling, who rose to fame as the author of the Harry Potter series, is known for writing about magical subjects and fantasy worlds. But her latest book bears more than a passing resemblance to reality — and, critics say, not in a good way.

The Ink Black Heart is the sixth installment of Rowling's thriller series Cormoran Strike, which she penned under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith. The 1,024-page tome started raising eyebrows as soon as it hit stores on Tuesday.

Observers noted that the plot appears to mirror Rowling's own experience of taking heat and losing fans for expressing transphobic views in recent years. Rowling has said publicly that the book was not based on her own life, even though some of the events that take place in the story did in fact happen to her as she was writing it.

""Although I have to say when it did happen to me, those who had already read the book in manuscript form were [like] – are you clairvoyant?"" Rowling wrote in a Q&A on Galbraith's website. ""I wasn't clairvoyant, I just – yeah, it was just one of those weird twists. Sometimes life imitates art more than one would like.""

In the book, a popular artist gets harassed for her opinions

The book centers the story of Edie Ledwell, a popular cartoonist who, according to the official description, is ""persecuted by a mysterious online figure"" — and ultimately found dead — after her cartoon was criticized for being racist, ableist and transphobic (at least partly over a bit involving ""a hermaphrodite worm,"" Rolling Stone reports).

Culture Why Author J.K. Rowling Is Facing Backlash From LGBTQ Activists Why Author J.K. Rowling Is Facing Backlash From LGBTQ Activists Listen · 2:40 2:40

""The book takes a clear aim at 'social justice warriors' and suggests that Ledwell was a victim of a masterfully plotted, politically fueled hate campaign against her,"" the magazine continues, adding that the character gets doxxed — with ""photos of her home plastered on the Internet"" — and faces threats of rape and death because of her opinions.

Parts of the story seem to mirror Rowling's experience

Rowling has made her own opinions known, particularly in regards to the transgender community, over the last several years.

She faced backlash in 2019 for publicly supporting Maya Forstater, a researcher who had lost her job over transphobic tweets. The following year, Rowling posted several controversial tweets, including one opinion piece that mocked the term ""people who menstruate"" (""I'm sure there used to be a word for those people,"" she tweeted. ""Wumben? Wimpund? Woomud?""), and published a long statement expressing her concerns with ""the consequences of the current trans activism.""

Rowling said in November that she's received death threats. She also publicly accused three activists of doxxing her when they posted photos of themselves holding pro-trans rights signs outside of her house in Scotland, ""carefully positioning themselves to ensure that our address was visible,"" she said.

The activists, who had been demonstrating in honor of International Transgender Day of Remembrance, later deleted the photo and deactivated their accounts because of the amount of transphobic backlash they had received online. Scottish police later investigated the so-called doxxing and determined no crimes had been committed (notably, Rowling's home is a popular tourist attraction, as Them points out).

Critics say the book is self-serving and ""beyond parody""

News of Rowling's book release has taken Twitter by storm, even prompting dueling hashtags – #IStandWithJKRowling and #ICantStandJKRowling.

Critics have decried the book as ""hilariously self-persecuting"" and ""beyond parody,"" with some drawing attention to the real-world problems facing transgender people, deriding its length (""500 pages longer than Dune, 300 pages longer than Infinite Jest and 100 pages longer than the Bible,"" wrote one) and calling for people to boycott her work.

Lark Malakai Grey, co-host of the queer Harry Potter podcast ""The Gayly Prophet"" told NPR over email that he finds the situation ""deeply embarrassing"" for Rowling.

""She has published a 1,000-page self-insert fanfiction where she's the victim—it's the kind of behavior that you'd expect from a petulant teenager, not a grown adult with immense wealth and power,"" he added. ""I have no idea what she expected, but seeing the internet fill with jokes about the book has been an absolute joy after all the harm she has caused my community over the past several years.""

Rowling's transphobic comments have lost her many fans

Rowling's stance has alienated many in her fanbase — which includes a large number of LGBTQ people — as well as a slew of prominent Harry Potter cast members: Actors Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint are among those who have condemned her comments and expressed their support for the trans community.

Rowling was noticeably absent from the Harry Potter 20th anniversary special, a de facto reunion for much of the franchise's cast and crew that aired on New Year's Day 2022. She told Graham Norton's ""Radio Show"" podcast on Saturday that she was invited to participate in the special but chose not to come because she saw it as ""about the films more than the books.""

In that same interview, she stressed that she had written her new book before the events of the past year.

""I said to my husband, 'I think everyone is going to see this as a response to what happened to me,' but it genuinely wasn't,"" she said. ""The first draft of the book was finished at the point certain things happened."""
Educators no longer need a college degree to begin teaching in Arizona public schools,https://www.azfamily.com/2022/07/09/educators-no-longer-need-college-degree-begin-teaching-arizona-public-schools/,nottheonion,"PHOENIX (3TV/CBS 5) -- The education requirement for teachers in Arizona has changed. Under legislation Gov. Doug Ducey signed earlier this week, a person only needs to be enrolled to get their college degree to begin teaching in public schools. It’s a big change, and it’s been met with mixed reactions.

Jens Larson said there was a teacher shortage back when he joined the profession in 2000. “I was hired as an emergency certified teacher. I had a degree but I didn’t have the teacher credentials that were needed,” Larson said.

For 14 years, he worked at the Phoenix Union High School District. He said the low pay, lack of respect, and resources led him to leave. Since leaving, he started Phoenix Youth Circus Arts Program and continues to work with children. “I have more fun teaching circus than I do teaching geometry, I have to admit that,” he said.

But this new change, SB 1159, he said, was a stretch. “The situation will be even worse if you’re dealing with either younger people or even less well-educated people,” Larson said.

“It could work, obviously there’s no one size fits all plan,” said Christopher Ramsey, a Phoenix teacher. Ramsey also benefitted from the teacher shortage years back. “I’m a teacher, and I taught for two years while doing an accelerated master’s program, so I didn’t have my teacher’s degree,” he added. He said if you have the right person, it could work.

The Arizona Educators Association, or AEA, fought this legislation. “You have to have some experience. It’s going to allow people to do on the job training, and that’s where it’s scary,” Marisol Garcia, the President of the AEA, said.

In response, Kaitlin Harrier, the Senior Education Policy Advisor to the Governor, wrote:

“Signing this bill into law furthers Governor Ducey’s pro-education policies by giving schools the flexibility to establish their own locally designed school leadership preparation programs and will allow those without a bachelor’s degree to start training to become a teacher while also completing their degree. This flexibility will help strengthen the teacher talent pipeline, provide the opportunity for more Arizonans to become teachers, and allow for locally driven solutions.”

Garcia said this changes the credentialing requirements for public schools. In addition, it brings it in line with charter schools. There is a website you can go to check if your child’s teacher is certified by the state. You can find more information at OACIS - Arizona Department of Education (azed.gov).

"Upset over LGBTQ books, a Michigan town defunds its library in tax vote",https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/upset-over-lgbtq-books-michigan-town-defunds-its-library-tax-vote,nottheonion,"Library Director Amber McLain resigned this spring, telling Bridge she had been harassed online and accused of indoctrinating children. Interim director Matthew Lawrence resigned later.

When the Patmos staff and elected board of directors declined to remove the books from the library’s collection, some upset residents organized an effort to defeat the library’s millage renewal.

The group, called Jamestown Conservatives, passed out flyers at the town’s Memorial Day parade that referenced “Gender Queer: a Memoir,” a Pride Month display at the library and a director who, in the group’s words, “promoted the LGBTQ ideology.”

“Pray that we can make changes and make the Patmos Library a safe and neutral place for our children,” the flyer said.

Yard signs urging residents to vote no on the library millage popped up along Riley Street, Jamestown’s main drag. One sign was directly across the street from the library, and another was conspicuously in the lawn of a library board member. That board member could not be reached for comment.

One resident posted a large, homemade sign that said, “50 percent increase to GROOM our kids? Vote NO on Library!”

Salem Sousley, who identifies as nonbinary and lives close by, said when they see the sign “it turns my stomach.”

Having books young adults can access on LGBT themes “is incredibly important,” Sousley said. “When I was growing up in Jenison (in Ottawa County), the language of who I was as a nonbinary person didn’t exist yet. When I read ‘Gender Queer,’ it was the first time I ever saw myself represented in a book.

“So many kids are struggling in silence, especially in areas like this,” Sousley said. “Having access to resources and materials of people who are sharing your experiences is literally life-saving.”

Jamestown Township, population just under 10,000, is politically conservative even for conservative Ottawa County. The township voted for Donald Trump for president by a margin of 76-21 percent in 2020. About 92 percent of residents are white, and the median income of $81,000 is 37 percent higher than that of the state median household income of $59,000.

The village of Jamestown, which is within the township, has streets of well-maintained homes and sidewalks shaded by large trees, with construction of new subdivisions nearby. There is an ice cream shop at the main intersection, just across a parking lot from the township library.

The library is built to resemble a train depot, commemorating the interurban trolley that ran from Holland to Grand Rapids a century earlier. Inside the library on Tuesday, staffers helped patrons check out books and find materials. A young mother laughed as her son played with hand puppets. Someone had brought a box of zucchini, with a sign for patrons to help themselves.

The main display inside the library was of “never out of print classics,” including the Bible and Ayn Rand's “The Fountainhead.”

One of the township’s three voting precincts Tuesday was in the community room of the library. Most of the people who spoke to Bridge outside the library said they voted to defund the facility.

“We don’t need to see those books out front,” said Sarah Johnson. “We’re all for the library. I use it. We want to make a statement that we want some say in the books (chosen to be in the collection).”

Steve Wiltz said he voted no because of “some of the materials that are in here I don’t agree with.”

Amanda Ensing, one of the organizers of the Jamestown Conservatives group, emerged from the library Tuesday wearing an “I voted” sticker. “They are trying to groom our children to believe that it’s OK to have these sinful desires,” Ensing said of library officials. “It’s not a political issue, it’s a Biblical issue.”

Walton, the library board president, had been optimistic that the millage would pass when he spoke to Bridge Michigan on election day.

On Tuesday afternoon as votes were still being cast, Walton said that if the millage was defeated, the library would continue to receive tax funds from the old millage through the first quarter of 2023. After those funds dry up and the library’s fund reserves of about $325,000 are depleted, “we would close,” he said.

Walton estimated that closure would be in fall 2023, barring a second millage renewal attempt approved by voters before then.

Most people who said they voted to defund the library Tuesday, said they didn’t believe it would close.

But without tax funds, the library doesn’t bring in enough in grants, fines and community room rentals to keep its doors open.

With a library closure, that community room where residents voted Tuesday would be unavailable, Walton said, so would the mobile wifi hotspots used by residents who lack wifi in their homes.

“There are community members who sit in the parking lot to use our wifi,” said Marcia Frobish, who serves on the library board. “The library is a lot more than books.”

The library has 67,000 books, videos and other items in its collection, of which about 90 have an LGBTQ theme, library officials said.

Ensing, who helped organize the no campaign, said she hoped the millage rejection would be a “wake-up call” that would encourage library officials to remove books from shelves that community members find objectionable.

If that’s done, “they can ask for a millage again,” she said.

But Walton didn’t appear ready to compromise Tuesday. He said he didn’t believe the library needed a wake-up call and shouldn’t remove books.

“A wake-up call to what? To take LGBTQ books off the shelf and then they will give us money? What do you call that? Ransom?

“We stand behind the fact that our community is made up of a very diverse group of individuals, and we as a library cater to the diversity of our community,” he said.

Walton could not be reached Wednesday.

Mikula of the library association said the Patmos Library could still get a millage on the November ballot, if ballot language is given to the Ottawa County clerk’s office by Aug. 16.

But after having just lost by 25 points, turning around public sentiment in less than three months might be difficult without concessions by the library, which Mikula said is difficult because public libraries must follow its “collection development policies. If patrons have challenged (books) and the library board has made a decision to keep them, then … the First Amendment protects the process.”

It’s a difficult position for the library, Mikula acknowledged. “It's hard to look at being threatened with the closure of your library because they won’t remove LGBT materials.”"
Sandy Hook conspiracy theorist says she's 'proud' to harass families of children who were killed in mass shootings,https://www.insider.com/conspiracy-theorist-proud-harass-sandy-hook-families-children-killed-shootings-2022-6,nottheonion,"Kelley Watt, under the username ""gr8mom,"" sends harassing messages to families of shooting victims.

She says she believes mass shootings are false-flag attacks and that she's ""proud"" of her actions.

Watt's claims were featured in the book ""Sandy Hook: An American Tragedy and the Battle for Truth.""

""Prove to the world you've lost your son,"" Kelley Watt wrote under the username ""gr8mom"" to Lenny Pozner, whose 6-year-old, Noah, was killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting.

A suburban Tulsa, Oklahoma, grandmother of two, Watt has spent the greater part of the past decade ""researching"" mass shootings — which she says she considers false-flag operations intended to push gun-control legislation through the US government, despite the fact that no significant legislation has been passed in response to such shootings.

Her ""research"" involves sending harassing messages to surviving family members of people who have died in mass shootings, including the attack at Sandy Hook Elementary School that left 20 first-grade students and six adults dead.

""I just had a strong sense that this didn't happen,"" she said in an interview with Elizabeth Williamson. ""Too many of those parents just rub me the wrong way.""

Watt shared her story with Williamson for the recently released book, ""Sandy Hook: An American Tragedy and the Battle for Truth,"" and told the author she was ""proud"" of what she had done and continued to do.

She said she spent hours trying to prove her baseless claims about Sandy Hook. Some of her theories are: The photos of the shooter's bedroom were too barren to have a teenager living in it, Chris and Lynn McDonnell — whose 7-year-old, Grace, was killed in the shooting — didn't cry enough for parents who had just lost a daughter, and other parents were ""too old to have kids that age.""

But nothing, not even proof that she's wrong, has dissuaded Watt from her theories, which are in line with those pushed by the likes of the ""InfoWars"" host Alex Jones — who was found liable in at least four defamation cases for spreading lies that the Sandy Hook shooting was a hoax.

For example, Watt spent several years trying to prove that no company had been contracted to clean the elementary-school crime scene. When presented with the name of the business and police report, Watt was momentarily silent before casting further doubt on the evidence.

""I haven't seen that document,"" Watt said. ""But where are the receipts?""

Moving the goalposts of an argument in this way is a common tactic among conspiracy theorists, who are often driven by feelings of superiority and specialness and think they know something other people don't.

Watt's daughter, Madison, said she didn't have much hope for changing her mother's mind. Watt's promotion of conspiracy theories has led, at least in part, to the dissolution of Watt's marriage and contributed to tense relationships with her children. The stakes of acknowledging that she is wrong after she has lost so much are too great, her daughter said.

""There's a great deal of narcissism in this idea that 'everyone's got it wrong and we're in this select group of people that knows.' It would explode her own persona to allow any doubt to come in,"" Madison said of her mother's progressively extreme theories.

""Her whole identity has been built on this for so many years,"" Madison added. ""She's invested so much.""

Watt did not respond to Insider's requests for comment."
Uvalde schools police chief: I didn't know I was in charge at the shooting scene,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pete-arredondo-uvalde-schools-police-chief-interview-police-response/,nottheonion,"The Texas school police chief criticized for his actions during one of the deadliest classroom shootings in U.S. history said in his first extensive comments since the massacre, published Thursday, that he didn't consider himself the person in charge as it unfolded and assumed someone else had taken control of the law enforcement response.

Pete Arredondo, 50, the police chief of the Uvalde school district, also told The Texas Tribune he intentionally left behind both his police and campus radios before entering Robb Elementary School.

An 18-year-old gunman killed 19 children and two teachers behind a locked classroom door the chief said was reinforced with a steel jamb and couldn't be kicked in.

Poor radio communications is among the concerns raised about how police handled the May 24 shooting and why they didn't confront the gunman for more than an hour, even as anguished parents outside the school urged officers to go in.

Uvalde school district police chief Pete Arredondo. CBS 11 News

Separately, The New York Times reported Thursday that documents show police waited for protective equipment as they delayed entering the campus, even as they became aware that some victims needed medical treatment.

Arredondo told the Tribune that from the hallway of the school, he used his cell phone to call for tactical gear, a sniper and keys to get inside the classroom. He said he held back from the door for 40 minutes to avoid provoking gunfire and tried dozens of keys brought to him but that, one-by-one, they failed to work.

""Each time I tried a key I was just praying,"" he told the Tribune.

In the more than two weeks since the shooting, Arredondo's actions have come under intensifying scrutiny from both state officials and experts trained in mass shooting responses.

But Arredondo defended his actions and those of other law enforcement, remarking to the Tribune that, ""Not a single responding officer ever hesitated, even for a moment, to put themselves at risk to save the children,"" Arredondo said. ""We responded to the information that we had and had to adjust to whatever we faced. Our objective was to save as many lives as we could, and the extraction of the students from the classrooms by all that were involved saved over 500 of our Uvalde students and teachers before we gained access to the shooter and eliminated the threat.""

Steven McCraw, the head of the Texas Department of Public Safety, has said the school police chief, who he described as the incident commander, made the ""wrong decision"" to not order officers to breach the classroom more quickly to confront the gunman.

But Arredondo, who told the Tribune he believed carrying radios would slow him down as he entered the school and that he knew that radios didn't work in some school buildings, said he never considered himself the scene's incident commander and didn't give any instruction that police shouldn't attempt to breach the building.

""I didn't issue any orders,"" Arredondo said. ""I called for assistance and asked for an extraction tool to open the door.""

Arredondo hasn't responded to repeated interview requests and questions from The Associated Press.

Arredondo's account and records obtained by the Times were published Thursday as law enforcement and state officials have struggled to present an accurate timeline and details. They've also made frequent corrections to previous statements, and no information about the police response has been formally released by investigators since the days that followed the attack.

According to documents obtained by the Times, a man investigators believe to be Arredondo could be heard on body camera footage talking about how much time was passing.

""People are going to ask why we're taking so long,"" said the man, according to a transcript of officers' body camera footage obtained by the newspaper. ""We're trying to preserve the rest of the life.""

Sixty officers had assembled on the scene by the time four officers made entry, according to the report. The two classrooms where the shooting took place included 33 children and three teachers.

Not all the victims were found dead when officers finally went inside: one teacher died in an ambulance and three children died at nearby hospitals, according to the records obtained by the Times, which included a review of law enforcement documents and video that have been gathered as part of the investigation.

The family of Xavier Lopez, 10, said the boy had been shot in the back and lost a lot of blood as he waited for medical attention.

""He could have been saved,"" Leonard Sandoval, the boy's grandfather, told the newspaper. ""The police did not go in for more than an hour. He bled out.""

The records obtained by the Times offered other new details, including that the gunman, Salvador Ramos, had a ""hellfire"" trigger device meant to enable a semiautomatic AR-15-style rifle to be fired more like an automatic weapon, but didn't appear to have used it during the attack. Ramos had spent more than $6,000 amassing an arsenal of weapons that included two AR-15-style rifles, accessories and hundreds of rounds of ammunition, according to the documents.

The Times reported that some of the officers who first arrived at the school had long guns, and that Arredondo learned the gunman's identity while inside the school and attempted to communicate with him through the closed classroom doors.

Eva Mireles, one of the teachers who was killed, made a phone call to her husband, a Uvalde school district police officer, during the attack. The documents obtained by the Times show that Ruben Ruiz informed responders on the scene that his wife was still alive in one of the classrooms.

""She says she is shot,"" Ruiz could be heard telling other officers as he arrived inside the school at 11:48 a.m., according to the body camera transcript obtained by the Times.

By 12:46 p.m., Arredondo seemed to give his approval for officers to enter the room, the Times reported.

""If y'all are ready to do it, you do it,"" he said, according to the transcript.

About a week after the shooting, department of public safety officials said Arredondo was no longer cooperating with the agency and had not responded to interview requests from the Texas Rangers, the agency's investigative unit.

Arredondo's attorney, George E. Hyde, told the Tribune for Thursday's story that Arredondo could not do an interview on the day the Rangers asked because he was covering shifts for his officers. Hyde said Arredondo is willing to cooperate with the Rangers investigation but would like to see a transcript of his previous comments.

""That's a fair thing to ask for before he has to then discuss it again because, as time goes by, all the information that he hears, it's hard to keep straight,"" Hyde said."
Speeding woman on cocaine kills drunk driver high on meth in Las Vegas area,https://www.8newsnow.com/crime/speeding-woman-on-cocaine-kills-drunk-driver-high-on-meth-in-north-las-vegas-police-say/,nottheonion,"NORTH LAS VEGAS, Nev. (KLAS) — A speeding woman is accused of driving under the influence of cocaine and alcohol when she crashed into another car, killing its driver who was under the influence of methamphetamine, police said.

Summer Butler, 37, faces charges of DUI resulting in death, reckless driving and being in possession of a controlled substance in connection with the fatal crash in January, court documents obtained by the 8 News Now I-Team said.

On Jan. 14, North Las Vegas police reported a two-car crash near Cheyenne Avenue and Civic Center Drive. Police said a car was making a U-Turn in a center lane, causing the front of another car, which Butler was driving, to collide with it. The driver and the passenger in the first car were both ejected from the vehicle, police said.

Butler’s car traveled about 150 feet before it stopped in some landscaping, police said. All three people involved were taken to the hospital. There, police said Butler “was acting erratic [and] had to be sedated by medical staff,” a report said.

While a trauma paramedic was attending to Butler’s injuries, “a small baggie containing a white substance fell out of the left side of her bra,” police said. Police confirmed the substance was cocaine.

Nearly two weeks after the crash, blood tests confirmed Butler had cocaine and cannabinoids in her system. The blood draw also found Butler had an alcohol level of .102, which is above the legal limit.

The victim who died in the crash had a blood alcohol level more than three times above the legal limit. The person also had a substantial amount of methamphetamine in their system, police said.

Data from Butler’s car showed she was traveling 70 mph just seconds before the collision, police said. One second before impact, Butler was driving at 73 mph, data from her car showed, according to police.

The speed limit in the area is 40 mph.

The driver and the passenger in the first car were both ejected from the vehicle, police said. (NLVPD/KLAS)

A records check revealed Butler had previously pleaded guilty to DUI in Omaha, Nebraska, in 2017.

Police issued a warrant for Butler’s arrest in June. A judge released her on $15,000 bail on Aug. 29, ordering her to stay away from all drugs and alcohol.

Records show Butler remained at the Clark County Detention Center as of Tuesday. The victim’s name was not readily available.

A police spokesperson said officers initially did not suspect the victim was impaired but that toxicology results showed otherwise."
Tennessee voters officially ban all forms of slavery in the state,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/slavery-banned-tennessee-constitutional-amendment-inmate-punishment/,nottheonion,"Tennessee has officially banned all forms of slavery. Voters on Tuesday approved a ballot measure that removes language allowing slavery and involuntary servitude as forms of punishment for those convicted of crimes.

The measure passed with 79.54% of the votes, according to the Secretary of State's office.

The measure amended Article I, Section 33 of the Tennessee Constitution, which states that ""slavery and involuntary servitude are forever prohibited in this state – except as punishment for a person who has been duly convicted of crime."" The new amendment removes the language allowing for these punishments.

The section will now read: ""Slavery and involuntary servitude are forever prohibited. Nothing in this section shall prohibit an inmate from working when the inmate has been duly convicted of a crime.""

Before it was sent to voters in the state, a majority of Tennessee lawmakers supported the proposal, but six legislators voted against it.

""I'm a non-lawyer and most of my voters are non-lawyers and I can't explain this amendment in words they understand,"" Republican State Senator Frank Niceley said during a 2021 meeting of the Tennessee General Assembly. ""The Constitution is too sacred is too scared to clutter up with a lot stuff non-lawyers can't explain to other non-laywers. So I guess I'll be voting no on this.""

The measure was one of four on the ballot in the state this Election Day.

The 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution abolished slavery in 1865, but includes similar language allowing for involuntary servitude to be imposed as punishment for crimes.

State Senator Raumesh Akbari said in an interview with Fox Nashville last year that the amendment to the state's constitution would close that loophole.

A bipartisan group of legislators supported the ""Vote Yes on 3"" campaign, which urged voters to adopt the ballot measure. ""Words matter and in the constitution, there is still a resemblance of slavery leftover,"" Democratic State Rep. Joe Townes said in a bipartisan campaign ad with Republican Rep. Jeremy Faison.

""It's important that we do away with all thoughts of slavery in our constitution,"" Faison said."
Senate candidate who smoked blunt in ad burns Confederate flag in latest spot,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/593622-senate-candidate-who-smoked-blunt-in-ad-burns-confederate-flag-in-latest,nottheonion,"Gary Chambers, a U.S. Senate candidate in Louisiana who went viral last month for smoking a blunt in a campaign ad, burned a Confederate flag while decrying restrictive voting laws in his latest video released on Wednesday.

In a one-minute video titled “Scars and Bars,” Chambers is seen wearing a camo jacket as he pins a Confederate flag on a clothesline and ignites it with a lighter — right after he cites the famous Declaration of Independence line “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.”

As the flag burns, the Louisiana Democrat argues that inequality lingers and “remnants of the Confederacy remain” in the South. The candidate mentions gerrymandered districts and restrictive voting laws as “byproducts” of the Confederacy.

“The attacks against Black people, our right to vote and participate in this democracy, are methodical,” he said. “Our system isn’t broken. It’s designed to do exactly what it’s doing, which is producing measurable inequity.”

According to the Brennan Center, 19 states passed 34 restrictive voting laws in response to a conservative push to tighten up elections following former President Trump’s false claims that the 2020 election was stolen.

Earlier this year, Congressional Democrats attempted to push through a voting rights package to address the restrictive voting laws but failed to secure enough votes in the Senate.

Chambers is running to unseat Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) in the upcoming midterm election. He gained national attention last month with the release of a campaign ad in which he puffs on a blunt while arguing for the legalization of cannabis, the criminalization of which disproportionately affects Black people.

The candidate is a co-founder of a media outlet called The Rouge Collection and ran unsuccessfully for a U.S. House seat last year in Louisiana.

In Wednesday’s video, Chambers mentioned other issues that affect Black Americans, including access to health care, which has been highlighted during the pandemic, as minorities have had higher rates of severe illness and death from COVID-19.

Chambers said 1 in 9 Black Americans do not have health insurance and 1 in 3 Black children live in poverty.

“It’s time to burn what remains of the Confederacy down,” he said in the video. “I do believe the South will rise again, but this time it will be on our terms.”"

A 26-year-old man volunteered to drink a dysentery smoothie that would give him life-threatening diarrhea to help scientists making a vaccine: 'It's the most brutally sick I have ever been',https://www.insider.com/man-drank-smoothie-that-gave-him-dysentery-for-vaccine-trial-2022-4,nottheonion,"A man who drank a diarrhea-inducing smoothie described his 11 days in an inpatient vaccine trial.

Jake Eberts, 26, said he'd do it again, for both the money and the humanitarian cause.

Shigella bacteria kills hundreds of thousands of people every year, and there is no vaccine for it.

On April 5, Jake Eberts drank a shot glass' worth of cloudy, salty liquid that he knew was infused with diarrhea-producing shigella bacteria. He also knew that bacteria would — in all likelihood — give him an excruciating case of dysentery. And it did.

Eberts was recently part of an 11-day inpatient vaccine trial at the University of Maryland, where he was one of 16 young, healthy adult participants given a drinkable shigella shot, which they all swallowed knowing it would likely make them violently ill.

It was all part of a tightly controlled process to test the vaccine candidate by ""challenging"" volunteers with a pathogen — some vaccinated and some not — and seeing how they fared.

Even though Eberts said what followed were ""the worst eight hours of my life,"" he said he'd do it all over again, provided that he was paid (he earned more than $7,000 in this trial) and knew the research was being done for a good cause.

""I don't want to make myself out to be Mother Teresa here — would not have done this for free. It's a big ask to ask someone to get dysentery,"" Eberts told Insider on the eve of his dismissal from the dysentery ward.

""The entire time, I was like, 'Wow, this is an awful disease.' And I just got really emotional, probably also because I was just delirious, about the thought of small children in the developing world dealing with this.""

Why scientists need to test this vaccine on people like Eberts

@wokeglobaltimes

Every year, hundreds of thousands of children and older adults around the world die after contracting shigella. There is no approved vaccine against the bacteria, which is the second-leading cause of diarrhea death globally. (The No. 1 killer diarrhea is rotavirus, but there are multiple vaccines against it.)

People around the world get shigella the same way Eberts did: after sticking the bacteria in their mouth. Often, people are exposed by drinking contaminated water, eating food that has been prepared or handled by someone with dirty hands, or through coming into direct contact with an infected person's poop.

Scientists at the Institut Pasteur in France have been developing a vaccine against shigella for several years. It was tested initially in Israel and is now being tried out in several dozen consenting healthy adults in Maryland, including Eberts, as well as young kids in Kenya who may come in contact with the bacteria in their day-to-day lives. (They are not given shot glasses containing shigella.)

If the current phase-two trials find the vaccine is both well-tolerated and effective at preventing severe disease, it could be tested in a large-scale real-world trial in hundreds of thousands of kids around the globe, a final regulatory move before the vaccine could be put on clinic shelves worldwide.

Dr. Wilbur Chen, who is running the trial at the University of Maryland, is hoping for 70% protection. If the vaccine doesn't demonstrate at least 50% protection against severe disease in his trial, ""then I think then we will have a vaccine that really fails, unfortunately,"" Chen said, adding: ""It's kind of a high bar.""

'Never in my life have I felt so exhausted'

Eberts had a hunch that he was in the unlucky nonvaccinated placebo group, given that he didn't react in any noticeable way to his two injections. He also ended up with one of the worst cases of dysentery in this trial.

""If I did get the vaccine, that is really bad news for the vaccine,"" he said.

His illness started about 40 hours after he drank the shigella, when he woke up to cramps and some chills, feeling like he had a ""stomach bug."" His symptoms quickly progressed into fever, diarrhea, and bloody stool.

""I truly felt like I could not move,"" Eberts said, adding that getting up to go to the bathroom or get his vitals checked required a ""Herculean effort.""

""Every movement in the bathroom, to get up to wash my hands or to grab a paper towel, I would lie back down on the ground and just sit there for five minutes,"" he said.

Nurses began prescribing him many liters of rehydration solution, which he described as ""sad Gatorade,"" a salty-sweet water designed to keep him functioning but without any yummy flavor or bright coloring.

He lied down under a pile of blankets, and his fever rose to 103 degrees Fahrenheit. After several hours, he was put on IV fluids and given the antibiotic ciprofloxacin. Within four hours, his condition started to improve, as he went from ""death's door"" to coherent, lucid, and able to walk and talk ""with a little bit of effort.""

""I was exhausted and felt miserable, but I didn't feel fear,"" he said. ""I knew this is something I signed up for, and it will pass, and I'm not going to die or anything. But even if I had been just at home and had somehow come across this, I would've been terrified because it was just awful. And the deterioration was so rapid.""

Participants were isolated and had to bleach the toilet after each use

People with shigellosis can infect others with the bacteria. That meant the study participants had to stay inside and eat alone during the entire 11- to 12-day study.

Going to the bathroom during the study was a multistep 15-minute event involving a special toilet ""hat,"" a nurse, and bleach.

Every time Eberts had to relieve himself, he'd put the white hat (pictured below) over the brim of a toilet, do his business, cover it with a paper towel or biohazard bag, and cart it down the hallway for sample extraction. Once the nurses had taken what they needed from him, he'd pour the rest of his waste in a toilet, cover it with bleach, wait five minutes, and flush away.

When Eberts got really sick, the nurses rolled in a commode and did the sample processing for him.

This diligent feces and urine collection — painstaking though it may be — has an important role in discovering how well this vaccine works.

Taking precise measurements from participants' blood, urine, and poo helps researchers like Chen learn exactly what kind of immune response the vaccine elicits.

Researchers can better gauge whether the vaccine lessens the burden of disease by analyzing the level of anti-shigella IgA antibodies a person is excreting, and determining the amount and type of cytokines circulating in their stool.

""It is a way for us to be able to learn about the mechanisms of protection,"" Chen said.

Eberts inspired others to sign up for vaccine 'challenges' on Twitter

Motivated by how awful the disease made him feel, Eberts raised more than $23,900 for The Water Project while in isolation. And his barrage of detailed tweets about the experience while in inpatient care inspired several dozen others to volunteer to take part in this style of vaccine research.

""I've been spending my career trying to tackle this, and it's always a challenge to try to find willing volunteers,"" Chen said, adding that within a few days of Jake's tweeting, the center had ""20- or 30-some people that signed up with interest"" in its trials.

The advertisement on Instagram that caught Eberts' eye. @wokeglobaltimes

""He was just sharing from the heart, and I think people liked it,"" Chen said.

Now that the trial is over, and Eberts is allowed to go outside and touch grass again, he's looking forward to spending some time with his dog and enjoying a latte or two. (""There's no espresso machine"" at the trial site, he said.)

Eberts is ineligible for another shigella trial like this now that he's been exposed to the bacteria, but he said he would consider trying another vaccine ""challenge"" like it. Other trials are being run for dengue-fever, flu, and malaria vaccines.

""Some people go to soup kitchens to get their charity fix. This might be the way I do it,"" he said."
Gov. Abbott attributes mass shootings to mental health issues a month after cutting $211 million from mental health commission,https://www.ksat.com/news/local/2022/05/30/gov-abbott-attributes-mass-shootings-to-mental-health-issues-a-month-after-cutting-211-million-from-mental-health-commission/,nottheonion,"UVALDE, Texas – “We as a state - we as a society - need to do a better job with mental health. Anybody who shoots somebody else has a mental health challenge. Period. We as a government need to find a way to target that mental health challenge and do something about it.”

Those are the words of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott just days after an 18-year-old high school student massacred 19 students and two teachers at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde.

Abbott has doubled down on his stance that mass shootings are an issue of mental health and not gun access following the Uvalde massacre.

However, in April, Abbott slashed nearly $211 million from the Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC), which oversees mental health services in Texas.

Abbott diverted the funds to add to his effort to send National Guard to the Texas-Mexico border, currently known as Operation Lone Star.

No other Texas agency received a more significant cut than the HHSC when Abbott slashed funding.

The massive cut comes as Texas ranks 44th in the U.S. for an overall ranking of mental health measures and last out of all 50 states in access to mental health care, according to the 2022 State of Mental Health in America report.

The Texas Legislature has spent billions in the last decade funding DPS’ so-called border security mission, even though few metrics exist to measure its success.

Some of those operations have occurred in and around Uvalde, which is just under 100 miles from the border.

In fact, Abbott’s office directed $3.3 million to Uvalde County in February for county law enforcement agencies to help “prosecuting border-related crimes including drug and human smuggling, and related criminal trespassing and evading arrest,” the Uvalde Leader News reported.

On Friday, Abbott discussed the option of passing new laws to make sure that schools are safer. He again attributed the issue to mental health and specifically not to gun access or violence.

“You can expect a robust discussion, and my hope is laws passed, that I will sign, addressing health care in this state. There is an array of healthcare issues that we face as a state in general but there are an array of healthcare issues that relate to those who commit gun crimes in particular. Those need to be addressed,” Abbott said. “... If there’s anybody here who thinks we have perfect health care in this country or in this world - they’re wrong. If there’s anybody who thinks we can’t do more to address mental health care - they’re wrong. We can and we’re going to.”

Example video title will go here for this video

HOUSTON — The 2022 version of CNBC's annual ""Top States for Business"" study ranks Texas as the second worst state to live in the country.

That same study named Texas the fifth best state in the country for business.

But some experts question whether keeping the status quo can keep drawing workers who have more leverage and more mobility than ever.

The team behind the study graded Texas an ""F"" in the life, health and inclusion category. They found that ""skilled workers are still flocking to the state despite longstanding quality of life issues…. But when they arrived, they are finding limited childcare options, a stressed health care system with the highest rate of uninsured, new curbs on voting rights, and few protections against discrimination.""

""Everybody has their own way of doing research, and I completely disagree with that,"" said Texan Eric Fuentas from San Antonio. ""If you want to live in a state that has everything, Texas is your state.""

""They got a lot of programs for people who (are) not able to afford daycare and things like that, so I’m not sure why that’s listed as well,"" said Corey Harrison, who recently moved to Texas.

Dietrich von Biedenfeld is a business professor at the University of Houston - Downtown. He says he's not surprised by the study's results.

""Is $800 a month a feasible amount for a young professional to have to pay for childcare, which is around the average rate in the city of Houston?"" von Biedenfeld asked.

He says quality of life issues like health care and paid time off are crucial in luring Gen Z and Millennials as older employees retire.

""Just like businesses, Dell, etc., have come to Texas, they can then go somewhere else,"" von Biedenfeld said.

And a longtime Texas selling point, cheap housing, seems to be getting harder and harder to find.

""Who worse? Who’s before us?"" asked Harrison.

""Arizona,"" said KHOU 11's Adam Bennett.

""Nah. They never lived in Michigan before, huh?"" responded Harrison.

On the other end of the spectrum, Hawaii, Maine, and Vermont were named the three best states to live in."
The nation's poorest state used welfare money to pay Brett Favre for speeches he never made,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/nations-poorest-state-used-welfare-money-pay-brett-favre-speeches-neve-rcna45871,nottheonion,"Brett Favre earned nearly $140 million as a star NFL quarterback over two decades and millions more in product endorsements.

But that didn’t stop the state of Mississippi from paying Favre $1.1 million in 2017 and 2018 to make motivational speeches — out of federal welfare funds intended for needy families. The Mississippi state auditor said Favre never gave the speeches and demanded the money back, with interest.

Favre has repaid the fees, although not the $228,000 in interest the auditor also demanded. But the revelation by the auditor that $70 million in TANF welfare funds was doled out to a multimillionaire athlete, a professional wrestler, a horse farm and a volleyball complex are at the heart of a scandal that has rocked the nation’s poorest state, sparking parallel state and federal criminal investigations that have led to charges and guilty pleas involving some of the key players.

Favre hasn’t been accused of a crime or charged, and he declined an interview. His lawyer, Bud Holmes, said he did nothing wrong and never understood he was paid with money intended to help poor children. Holmes acknowledged that the FBI had questioned Favre in the case, a fact that hasn’t previously been reported.

The saga, which has been boiling at low grade for 2½ years, drew new attention in July, when the state welfare agency fired a lawyer who had been hired to claw back some of the money, just after he issued a subpoena seeking more information about the roles of Favre and the former governor, Phil Bryant, a Republican. The current governor, Republican Tate Reeves, acknowledged playing a role in the decision to sack Brad Pigott, accusing the Bill Clinton-appointed former U.S. attorney of having a political agenda. But the state official who first uncovered the misspending and fraud, auditor Shad White, is a Republican.

In his first television interview since he was fired, Pigott said his only agenda was to get at the truth and to recoup U.S. taxpayer funds sent to Mississippi that he says were “squandered.”

“The notion of tens of millions of dollars that was intended by the country to go to the alleviation of poverty — and to see it going toward very different purposes — was appalling to many of us,” he said. “Mr. Favre was a very great quarterback, but having been a great NFL quarterback, he is not well acquainted with poverty.”

Pigott, who before he was fired sued on behalf of Mississippi’s welfare agency, naming Favre and 37 other grant recipients, laid ultimate blame at the feet of top Mississippi politicians, including Bryant.

“Governor Bryant gave tens of millions of dollars of this TANF welfare money to a nonprofit led by a person who he knew well and who had more connections with his political party than with the good people in Mississippi who have the heart and the skills to actually cajole people out of poverty or prevent teenage pregnancies,” he said.

In an interview with the website Mississippi Today, Bryant said he never knew the grants came from welfare money. His lawyer didn’t respond to requests for comment.

The person in charge of the nonprofit group Pigott was referring to is Nancy New, a close friend of Bryant’s wife. New and her son have pleaded guilty to state and federal charges and agreed to cooperate. New, a key player in doling out the money, said in a court document that Bryant was among those involved in directing the transactions. Her lawyer declined to comment.

The former head of the state welfare agency, John Davis, has pleaded not guilty to state charges of bribery and conspiracy, and law enforcement officials say the investigations continue.

Favre defended himself in a series of tweets last year against allegations from White, the state auditor, that he accepted state money for speeches he never intended to give.

“I would never knowingly take funds meant to help our neighbors in need, but for Shad White to continue to push out this lie that the money was for no-show events is something I cannot stay silent about,” Favre tweeted.

The state auditor rejected Favre’s defense in a series of tweets that pointed to the contract he obtained and said, “You can continue to use your megaphone as a celebrity to drown out the facts, but it will not change the facts.”

The speeches aren’t the only welfare grants tied to Favre. Text messages obtained by Mississippi Today and authenticated by Pigott show that Favre sought a $3.2 million grant for a drug company in which he was a shareholder and a $5 million award that built a volleyball arena at the University of Southern Mississippi, where his daughter played the sport and where he played football. Favre’s lawyer declined to comment.

The drug company, Prevacus, was touting treatments to mitigate the effects of concussions, although none were approved by the Food and Drug Administration. In some texts, Favre suggested awarding shares in the drug company to Bryant while he was governor.

“Don’t know if legal or not but we need cut him in,” Favre texted a company official in November 2018, referring to Bryant. Following up three days later, Favre wrote, “Also if legal I’ll give some of my shares to the Governor.”

Bryant has said he never would have accepted such an offer.

“All of it remains quite a mystery,” Pigott told NBC News, “as to why Mr. Favre would get the benefit of millions of dollars in TANF welfare money, both for a fee for speeches he didn’t make, $2 million-plus to go to a company in which he was the largest outside individual investor and $5 million for his alma mater to play volleyball in a volleyball building.”

The state auditor said he found other “no show” contracts benefiting former pro athletes and family members of Davis, the welfare agency director.

The auditor said Davis directed one contract to Austin Smith, his nephew, who was paid more than $400,000 to provide “coding skills” classes even though prosecutors allege he had no such skills “and did not know how to teach.”

At least $3 million went to Ted DiBiase, a retired professional wrestler. Marcus Dupree, a former college football star, also received $370,000 in welfare funds, which prosecutors say partly went to fund his horse ranch.

Paul LaCoste, who is the current governor’s athletic trainer, was paid $300,000 in welfare funds to run a fitness boot camp for legislators.

DiBiase, Dupree, and LaCoste didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Smith denies all wrongdoing, according to a court filing provided by his attorney.

The scandal has also spotlighted the meager scope of Mississippi’s welfare program and provided a stark reminder of the Clinton-era welfare reform that provided states with block grants and wide latitude in how they spend them. According to state figures, Mississippi rejects more than 90% of those who apply for the federal welfare benefit known as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF. This year 2,500 children received benefits, state officials said, in a state with 192,000 poor children.

One of those who had trouble getting help was Tamara Edwards, who raised four children on her own while working a series of low-wage jobs.

She once received welfare vouchers for child care, and in 2009 she applied again, she said. Even though her income was low enough, she was denied.

“They told me they didn’t have the funds,” said Edwards, who now works as a cook at a Cracker Barrel restaurant.

Advocates and state legislators say Mississippi’s welfare agency, under years of conservative Republican state governments, has a history of questionable spending and a lack of transparency.

“TANF has been a slush fund for a long time,” said Oleta Fitzgerald, who is the director of the Children’s Defense Fund’s Southern Regional Office and is based in Jackson, the state capital. “Mississippi is the poorest doggone state in the country — where is the money, and what are they doing with it? There is nobody on welfare — welfare participation rates are way down — and no one knows where that money is being spent.”

Aisha Nyandoro, the chief executive of Springboard to Opportunities, a local nonprofit group that works with residents of affordable housing, said: “And DHS [the state Department of Human Services] will tell you that the reason that they cannot go about allocating the TANF funds is because they can’t find any families who are eligible. Go outside and throw a rock. It’s Mississippi. You can find an eligible family.”

Jarvis Dortsch, a former state legislator who heads the state’s chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, said that when he was a member of the Legislature, “I could not get a list of how the money was being spent.”

Dortsch said he had to resort to secrecy.

“Someone had snuck me a list — it didn’t have [a] DHS [logo] on it — they had it printed out and snuck it out,” he said.

White, the auditor, told NBC News the investigation goes on. “My office is continuing the work we started over two years ago on what is now the largest public fraud case in our state’s history,” he said. “We will also continue to work with our state and federal partners to be sure each person responsible for this massive scheme is held fully accountable under the law.”"
Black Man Arrested On Warrant For 49-Year-Old White Man With A “Bushy White Beard” And Blue Eyes,https://theurbandaily.com/3630756/black-man-arrested-on-warrant-for-49-year-old-white-man-with-a-bushy-white-beard-and-blue-eyes/,nottheonion,"CLOSE

A Las Vegas Black man is suing multiple police departments after he was arrested on a warrant that was issued for a 49-year-old white man with a bushy white beard and blue eyes.

According to the lawsuit, on Jan. 8, 2020, 23-year-old Shane Lee Brown was driving home from work when he was pulled over by Henderson Police. He didn’t have his driver’s license so he told the officers his name and gave them his Social Security card.

A records check by officers revealed a bench warrant for a 49-year-old man named Shane Brown, who faced a weapons charge associated with a prior felon who was arrested with a gun. The lawsuit revealed that the older Brown had been convicted of a felony in 1994, three years before Shane Lee Brown was born.

The lawsuit also stated that during his arrest in 2020 officers, ”failed to perform even a cursory review of the warrant to determine if Shane Lee Brown was the person named in the warrant.”

Brown was sent to Henderson Detention Center, where he pleaded with officers that he was not the Shane Brown in the bench warrant, but was ignored.

Two days later, Las Vegas police transferred Brown to Clark County Detention Center and recorded his correct date of birth, race, and height. Officers also issued Brown a different identification number that was assigned to the older Shane Brown. He was then orderer by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department to appear in front of a judge for the older Brown’s bench warrant but under the younger Brown’s race and date of birth.

The 23-year-old would spend four days in Clark County Detention Center before finally appearing in front of a district judge who released him after the two men’s booking photos were shown side by side in court.

Brown would spend a total of six days in jail.

“Despite being informed of this mistaken identity, none of the unknown LVMPD police or LVMPD corrections officers bothered to review its records to determine whether Shane Lee Brown was the subject of the warrant,” read the lawsuit.

Brown is suing the Metropolitan Police Department, Henderson Police Department, the city of Henderson, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo, and Henderson Police Department Chief Thedrick Andres. The suit is seeking compensatory damages of $500,000 under federal law, at least $50,000 under state law, as well as additional punitive damages.

Did Meta really not see this coming, or that people would share answers so widely? Who knows. Although, the BlenderBot 3 does not always give a strait-forward answer.

When Max Wolff, a data scientist at BuzzFeed, popped the question about the chatbot's views on Zuckerberg, the bot gave a reply that looked like it intended to lighten up the situation- what do you think?

Ted Cruz tweets about rising Cancun flight costs ahead of another Texas winter storm,https://www.kxan.com/news/texas-politics/ted-cruz-tweets-about-rising-cancun-flight-costs-ahead-of-another-texas-winter-storm/,nottheonion,"AUSTIN (KXAN) — As Texas braces for the arrival of another winter storm, Sen. Ted Cruz pointed out that the cost of airfare to Cancun is not the only price rising right now.

Cruz posted Wednesday morning on his personal Twitter account, “Inflation is out of control.” He then listed the words gas prices, food prices and lumber prices next to upward arrow emojis. He concluded the tweet by writing, “And tickets to Cancun are up 32%!”

The tweet received mixed reactions online. Some Twitter users expressed amusement about the airfare comment, saying it shows Cruz’s sense of humor since it makes light of his trip to Mexico last year at the height of the previous winter storm. He flew with his family to Cancun in Feb. 2021 at a time when millions remained without power and water across the state. He later returned home after much uproar and called the trip “obviously a mistake.”

Cruz previously joked about taking the Cancun trip during remarks at the Conservative Political Action Conference a few weeks after last year’s Texas winter storm and again in a November tweet.

This latest social media post also stirred up much of the criticism Cruz faced last year, with people this time describing it as “insensitive,” “unhelpful” and “not funny.” State Rep. Gene Wu, a Houston Democrat, tweeted, “Let’s reminisce about that time you abandoned the state when we were going through a catastrophic natural disaster that took the lives of 700 Texans.”

After Cruz posted his tweet, the word Cancun trended Wednesday afternoon alongside the hashtag #TexasFreeze.

KXAN reached out Wednesday to Cruz’s office to ask for comment about why he tweeted this and whether he has any response to those saying online that the Cancun mention is inappropriate considering parts of Texas are bracing for another winter storm. KXAN also asked if he had a broader message he wanted to share. Neither Cruz nor anyone from his team has provided a response yet. KXAN will update this story when we receive a response.

While his personal Twitter account featured other jabs Wednesday at CNN and Spotify, Cruz’s official Senate account shared advice several times about how Texans can prepare for the impending winter storm. He tweeted a link Wednesday afternoon to a website displaying power outages monitored by the Public Utility Commission of Texas as well as other resources, like links to where people can find road and weather condition updates.

To help people prepare for the storm, KXAN also published a list of different things they can do to get ready for bitterly cold temperatures and ice accumulating on roads and power lines Thursday. Another continuously updated list includes the dozens of school districts throughout Central Texas canceling classes due to the expected wintry weather."
"College graduates are overestimating the salaries they'll start out at by $50,000, report finds",https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/29/study-says-college-graduates-overestimate-starting-salaries-by-50000.html,nottheonion,"watch now

Newly minted graduates are in for a shock. Although the job market and starting salaries for the Class of 2022 look significantly better than last year, they may fall far short of graduates' expectations. Employers plan to hire about 31% more new degree holders from this year's graduating class than they hired from the Class of 2021, according to a report from the National Association of Colleges and Employers. The increased demand for workers is also driving starting salaries higher for some majors, NACE found. The average starting salary for this year's crop of graduates is projected to be more than $50,000, based on the most recent data.

Yet current college students expect to earn twice that — $103,880 — in their first job, according to a separate survey of college students pursuing a bachelor's degree by Real Estate Witch in March. Undergraduate students across all majors and institutions overestimated their starting salaries by 88%, Real Estate Witch found. Ten years into their careers, students anticipate making more than $200,000, well over the average mid-career salary of $132,497. In fact, salary projections for the Class of 2022 vary greatly depending on the area of concentration. Employers projected starting salaries would increase 5.4% for math and sciences majors and decrease 14.8% for humanities majors, NACE found.

Overall, computer sciences majors are likely to be the highest paid just out of college, earning $75,900, on average, followed by engineering graduates. ""Students really want to understand the hiring demand and starting salaries within their major because they differ,"" said Mary Gatta, NACE's director of research and public policy. That underscores the importance of career counseling and career services, she added. ""It's also an equity issue,"" Gatta said. The idea is that pay transparency will bring about pay equity, which is essentially equal pay for work of equal or comparable value, regardless of worker gender, race or other demographic category. ""Informing students and workers can make a difference when we think about salary negotiations — it's one way to break down systemic barriers."""
Doritos bags will now have 5 fewer chips thanks to inflation,http://www.pennlive.com/life/2022/03/doritos-bags-will-now-have-5-fewer-chips-thanks-to-inflation.html,nottheonion,"Gas prices are rising, and chip numbers are falling.

As a result of inflation, bags of Doritos will now include five fewer chips.

Food and Wine reports how Doritos is just the latest snack that has fallen victim to “shrinkflation,” an ever-pervasive phenomenon in which beloved foodstuffs are getting cut down to size due to inflation.

WTRF-TV continues to report how the snack’s parent company, Frito-Lay, confirmed this week how shrinkflation is forcing Doritos to shed five chips per bag so, in the words of one representative, they “can give [people] the same price...[so they] can keep enjoying [Doritos] chips.”

The Daily Mail gives color to the phenomenon by explaining how inflation has hit almost eight percent—the highest seen in decades—under President Joe Biden with other household name brands such as Charmin, Bounty, Gatorade, and Crest grappling with spiking costs while trying to keep prices at reasonable levels.

These four aforementioned companies have also shrunk down their product sizes in order to keep costs tame for consumers, with Crest now selling 3.8-ounce toothpaste instead of 4.1-ounce tubes and Charmin selling 244 two-ply sheets of toilet paper per roll instead of 264.

News 12 Bronx explains how analysts estimate Frito-Lay will potentially save more than $50 million by cutting down on the number of Doritos chips they put into each bag.

Bags, by the way, will go from weighing 9.75 ounces to 9.25 ounces."
"Arizona communities would 'collapse' without cheap prison labor, Corrections director says.",https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2022/07/14/arizona-cities-would-collapse-without-prison-labor/10062910002/,nottheonion,"Arizona Department of Corrections Director David Shinn said Arizona communities would “collapse” without cheap prison labor, during testimony before the Joint Legislative Budget Committee Thursday.

Shinn made the statement while answering questions about a Request For Proposal for a contract to run the Florence West prison.

Sen. David Gowan asked Shinn about the nature of the work the prisoners do at the Florence West prison. In Arizona, all people in state prisons are forced to work 40 hours a week with exceptions for prisoners with health care conditions and other conflicting programming schedules. Some prisoners earn just 10 cents an hour for their work.

“These are low-level worker inmates that work in the communities around the county itself, I would imagine?"" Gowan asked.

“Yes. The department does more than just incarcerate folks,” Shinn replied. “There are services that this department provides to city, county, local jurisdictions, that simply can't be quantified at a rate that most jurisdictions could ever afford. If you were to remove these folks from that equation, things would collapse in many of your counties, for your constituents.”

Defending the choice to keep state and private prisons open despite dwindling populations, Shinn told the legislators “while it doesn't necessarily serve the department in the best interest to have these places open, we have to do it to support Arizona.”

“Without the ability to have these folks at far flung places like Apache, like Globe, like Fort Grant, even like Florence West, communities wouldn't have access to these resources or services, and literally would have to spend more to be able to provide that to their constituents,” Shinn said.

Budget committee staffer Geoff Paulsen said the state had purchased the facility through incremental payments over the life of the current contract, with the intention of the state taking ownership in October 2022.

The facility was built in 1997.

After taking ownership, the state would either need to provide staffing for the prison, or contract staffing out to another private contractor.

Shinn told the committee at this point, the state is in no position to run Florence West, citing 1,891 vacancies among corrections officers throughout the Department of Corrections.

“If the state were to take this over today, we would literally have to shut down functions and close programs,” Shinn said. “We cannot support that level of activity without our partners.”

As with most other private prison contracts in Arizona, the RFP to run Florence West guarantees the vendor a 90% occupancy rate, meaning the state pays a per diem rate for 675 prisoners, regardless of how many people are actually incarcerated there.

As of July 13, there were only 457 prisoners at Florence West.

Rep. Kelli Butler asked Shinn why the state would agree to such a contract condition, in which the state would likely be paying for more than 200 empty beds.

“I cannot speak firsthand on the logic of why previous contracts were written that way,” Shinn said. “However, I can assure you that we are looking at that very thing in this RFP process.""

Rep. John Kavanagh said to get companies interested in bidding for the contract, it was necessary to provide a profit motive.

“You have to guarantee that they're going to have people there, and they're going to have a profit that they make, they're going to have income,” Kavanagh said. “No one's going to enter into a contract when you can't guarantee the income that they expect. That's kind of based on basic business.”

After more questioning from Butler, Shinn confirmed there were currently more than 5,000 empty beds in the Arizona prison system state-wide.

“So we do have the option of switching these inmates out of this facility and into other facilities and save a lot of money for the taxpayer,” Butler said. “So I'm less concerned about whether or not this private prison company makes the profits that they want to make and more concerned about the taxpayer of Arizona.”

When Butler asked “Why aren’t we closing more prisons?” her line of questioning was

halted by committee leadership for being outside the scope of discussion.

Butler noted many of the people incarcerated at the Florence West prison are serving time for DUI’s, and asked about their access to substance abuse programming.

“During the interim, I did some study about what the private prisons were providing in terms of substance abuse treatment,” Butler said. She said she found that 13.9% of the people in private prisons received treatment. ""That means the vast majority do not.”

Butler asked if there was any language in the RFP mandating substance abuse treatment, but Shinn said he could not comment on specifics during the bidding process.

The most recent private prison contract in Arizona was awarded to private prison operator CoreCivic, in a deal that is expected to generate millions in profits for the company. The five-year contract took effect on Dec. 29, 2021. The state will pay CoreCivic $85.12 per prisoner, per day for the contract, with the state guaranteeing a minimum 90% occupancy rate. The prisoners were relocated to CoreCivic’s La Palma Correctional Center in Eloy from the state prison in Florence, which the state is closing.

An Arizona Republic investigation found that Arizona lawmakers invested more in private prisons after record-high campaign contributions from the industry in recent years.

The Joint Legislative Budget Committee gave a favorable review to the Department of Corrections RFP process for the Florence West prison on Thursday.

Responses to the RFP are due by July 30. The contract to run Florence West is for five years.

BMW Makes Heated Seats an $18/Month Subscription Service—Again,https://www.thedrive.com/news/bmw-is-charging-a-subscription-fee-for-heated-seats-again,nottheonion,"BMW has toyed with charging monthly subscriptions for certain digital ""Connected Drive"" options for a few years, testing the waters in different markets with different features. Korea is the latest market for subscription-based options, and customers can now pay monthly for physical options such as heated seats and a heated steering wheel.

As cynical as that might sound, Korean owners aren't forced to pay monthly for heated seats, or any of BMW's other available options, but monthly payments can be made to try those out. Heated seats, for instance, cost ₩24,000 (roughly $18) per month. But you can also pay for a year subscription ($176), a three-year subscription ($283), or you can buy the heated seats permanently ($406).

Some other options available with monthly or yearly subscriptions are a high beam assistant, BMW's Driving Assistance Plus software, a heated steering wheel, and an artificial noise generator to give electric cars like the i4 M50 a sci-fi noise while driving. Those will be available for different fees, and some can be added to a customer's car immediately via computer or smartphone.

There may be other avenues to enable the options, potentially. For something like heated seats, where the function is paywalled by software, I can easily see modders figuring out how to jailbreak the system and unlock the option for free. Volkswagen owners have done similar things to older VWs for more than a decade by using simple OBDII-based tools and laptops to unlock lighting modes and window functions, for instance. More recently, Ford Maverick owners learned they can unlock cruise control on entry-level Mavericks, simply by swapping out the steering wheel buttons and using some software.

So it isn't a stretch to assume BMW enthusiasts will figure out how to do the same thing for heated seats, heated steering wheels, and other options that the car already physically has equipped."
LAPD officers fired for ignoring robbery to catch a Snorlax in Pokemon GO,https://www.invenglobal.com/articles/16126/lapd-officers-fired-for-ignoring-robbery-to-catch-a-snorlax-in-pokemon-go,nottheonion,"Source: Niantic

Louis Lozano and Eric Mitchel, former police officers for the City of Los Angeles, filed a petition against the city of LA last week for being fired in 2017 after they were found to have ignored an ongoing robbery call in order to attempt to catch a Snorlax and other Pokemon in the mobile game Pokemon Go. The officers claimed that the city acted improperly by using in-car recordings of them during the disciplinary process. The court denied their petition.

According to the appeal court judgment published on Friday of last week, Apr. 15, 2017, the LAPD received a call of a robbery in progress at a Macy's in the Crenshaw Mall. According to testimony from LAPD Seargent Gomez, he answered the call, and called for backup, with Lazano and Mitchel not responding. Gomez sought further information from the officers after the events of the call, who claimed they had not heard his call for backup due to being in a loud area of the city.

Gomez instituted a review of the in-car recording of the officers, finding that they had heard the radio call and even discussed whether or not to respond and assist LAPD Captain Davenport with the robbery situation. Further reviews of the recordings by detectives found that the two officers were playing Pokemon Go, and were pursuing a Snorlax on 46th and Leimert, instead of doing their jobs. They also reportedly spotted a Togetic, which they successfully captured, unlike the suspects that they were supposed to be pursuing.

The two were ultimately fired for:

Failing to respond to the robbery call

Making misleading statements to their sergeant

Failing to respond over radio when their unit was called

Failing to handle an assigned radio call

Play Pokemon Go while on patrol

Making false statements to Detective McClanahan during the investigation

According to the appeal, a board of rights found that the two officers were guilty of multiple counts of misconduct listed above, with the board using in-car video to confirm that the officers ""willfully abdicated their duty to assist a commanding officer's response to a robbery in progress and playing a Pokemon mobile game while on duty."" The officers claim that the city violated the law by using the in-car recording in the proceedings and by denying protections afforded to officers by the POBRA act, which afford specific rights to peace officers. The court disagreed with their claims, so they will remain fired.

The petitioners also denied playing Pokemon GO, arguing they were simply monitoring the Pokemon Tracker application on their phones. Lozano reportedly claimed that he was just capturing an image of the pokemon via a companion app and that when they referred to ""fighting"" the Togetic, they really ""meant relaying information to the groups on [their] app."" However, the two admitted to leaving their beat area to search for a Snorlax, according to the judgment.

In the judgment, the court found that the city properly used the car recordings in the disciplinary proceedings and that Sergeant Gomez's questioning did not violate the petitioner's rights under the POBRA act."
Furries raise money for libraries after mayor threatens to withhold funds due to LGBTQ+ books,https://eu.clarionledger.com/story/news/2022/02/04/furry-community-raises-thousands-mississippi-library-ridgeland/6662813001/,nottheonion,"The furry community has taken charge of leading fundraising efforts for the Madison County Library System and raised thousands of dollars as funding for the libraries hangs in limbo.

The system entered the spotlight after Ridgeland Mayor Gene McGee said he would withhold $110,000 in annual funding after books with LGBTQ+ themes and authors were put on display.

More:New contract needed for Ridgeland to release funds to Madison libraries, officials say

Furries are a diverse community of writers, artists and role players who take an interest in anthropomorphized animals like wolves and cats. Furries are often part of the LGBTQ+ community.

McGee said he received complaints about books with LGBTQ themes or authors which had been part of a new book display in Ridgeland in September. He said he doesn't believe any sexually explicit material should be available in the library where children may be exposed to it.

""In my capacity as mayor, I simply believe the books are inappropriate for children,"" McGee said in a statement.

Soatok, a Florida tech industry worker and furry community member who prefers to go by his online handle, saw a Tweet about the situation and took action to raise awareness.

""I have friends in Mississippi and I know that this act of bigotry doesn't speak for all Mississippi residents,"" he said. ""So instead of dismissing the entire state because of the actions of one bad politician, I decided to explore the possibility of donating to offset the withheld amount.""

His search led him to Friends of the Ridgeland Library, a local nonprofit, which had a fundraiser launched by EveryLibrary, a national nonprofit political action committee for libraries, days after the decision gained national attention.

When Soatok made his initial donation of $500 on a $2,500 goal on Jan. 27, there weren't any other backers other than him. Less than 24 hours after posting a screenshot of his donation, the fundraiser had 189 backers and had raised more than $9,000.

Furries are known to swarm charitable causes that resonate with the community, Soatok said, and have raised upwards of $80,000 in a single weekend during conventions.

""As a result of the furry community's penchant for charity, I started this believing that reaching the $110,000 that the mayor is withholding was possible. There was no doubt that we could pull this off,"" he said. ""I didn't expect to make so much progress so quickly, however.""

As of Friday, the campaign has nearly 1,800 people who have pledged $78,200 and counting. It continues until Feb. 14.

Hundreds of people across the nation and abroad give thousands

Some of the books residents have submitted complaints about include ""What Are Your Words?"" by Katherine Locke, which explores how children can ask about and use preferred pronouns among peers.

In a conversation with library system Executive Director Tonja Johnson, McGee reportedly also mentioned ""The Queer Bible,"" a collection of essays from LGBTQ+ celebrities including Sir Elton John and ""Queer Eye"" star Tan France, as a questionable title.

Many of the comments left by those who support the campaign indicate they're also members of the furry community and encourage the library to stand up against hatred and discrimination.

Other members of the public have also contributed and offered support since the wave began, including a $100 donation from former Mississippi Gov. Ray Mabus.

""Don't give into bigots,"" Mabus wrote.

Soatok said McGee's actions go against many American rights and freedoms, which he believes is why the cause has resonated with so many.

""The freedom of speech, and of expression, and of the pursuit of happiness is so deeply intertwined with the American spirit that anyone who loves this country will resist the demands set out by Mayor McGee,"" Soatok said. ""This isn't just a furry sentiment, or an LGBTQ+ sentiment, but an American sentiment.""

'Amazed and humbled'

Teresa Gerald, president of Friends of the Ridgeland Library, said she's been flooded with messages from residents since the decision was announced late last month.

""The people that I'm hearing from are stunned that the mayor has taken this position,"" she said. ""The emotions range from stunned to angry and I'm kind of amazed and still having trouble believing that he's done this.""

Gerald said she hasn't heard of anything like this happening in the three decades she's lived in Ridgeland. She also never expected the fundraiser to get the kind of attention it has after EveryLibrary reached out to support the system.

""We're amazed and humbled by all these people who have never been to Ridgeland, Mississippi, or never even heard of Ridgeland, Mississippi, that are supporting this library,"" she said.

Gerald said she's reached out to representatives of the Ridgeland Board of Aldermen about the issue, but has only been thanked for her feedback so far. The board hosted a regular meeting Tuesday, but the funding matter was not on the agenda.

Biden Calls Fox Reporter 'Stupid Son of a Bitch' Over Inflation Question,https://ihr.fm/3fU5A4A,nottheonion,"One thing I always learned working in radio is the mic could ALWAYS be hot.

That is one thing President Biden (and past Presidents) sometime seem to forget when they are in front of reporters in Washington.

Today (1/24), President Biden got caught with a hot mic after a FOX News reporter asked a question about inflation.

TMZ reports:

Peter Doocy asked Biden if he thought inflation could be a political liability for the midterms, and Joe actually responded -- albeit, under his breath. It seems he thought the mic was turned off.

Not the case ... because his microphone was on, and you hear sarcastically say, ""That's a great asset -- more inflation. What a stupid son of a bitch.""

Doocy says he didn't hear it and was told by other reporters about the comment.

Parents sue officials over ruling that their daughter's death by more than 20 stab wounds was a suicide,https://www.insider.com/parents-challenge-suicide-ruling-woman-who-died-20-stab-wounds-2021-10,nottheonion,"The parents of a woman who died with more then 20 stab wounds are challenging a ruling of suicide.

They say they have new evidence that she could not have stabbed herself.

Police said Ellen Greenberg was alone in her locked home, with no evidence of a struggle.

The parents of a woman found dead with more than 20 stab wounds are suing the medical examiner's office over its declaration that she died by suicide, according to multiple reports.

More than 10 years since Ellen Greenberg's boyfriend found her dead in her Philadelphia apartment, her parents have won the right to take the ruling to a trial, CBS Philly reported.

It is a first step towards potentially securing the homicide ruling her parents have long sought, according to the outlet.

Greenberg, a 27-year-old elementary school teacher, came home early from work due to a snowstorm on January 26 2011, The Washington Post reported.

At around 5.30 p.m., her boyfriend Sam Goldberg came home to find himself locked out. Eventually he broke down the door to find Greenberg's body with a knife still in her chest, the police report noted.

The report goes on to say she was alone in the sixth-floor apartment, and that the door had been blocked by a swing bar from the inside. The knife matched the set in her knife block, which was tipped over, the report said.

The only access points were the front door and a balcony, police said. Officers say the snow outside was undisturbed.

A lack of defensive wounds, and no signs of a robbery, all led police to suspect a suicide, the report said.

Medical examiner Marlon Osbourne declared the death a homicide, but police continued investigating, according to the Post.

Weeks later, after it emerged that Greenberg had been prescribed anxiety and sleep medication — the side effects of which can include suicidal thoughts — Osbourne changed the death certificate to call it a suicide, the Post reported.

Greenberg's parents, Josh and Sandra Greenberg, have long questioned that finding. Almost 50,000 people have signed a petition calling for Josh Shapiro, the Pennsylvania Attorney General, to reopen the case.

Her parents said she had never mentioned suicidal thoughts and no problems with Goldberg, The Washington Post reported. According to the police report, she left no note.

Other details, they told the Post, raised questions — she had filled her car with gas before returning home, and had been preparing a fruit salad before she died.

The fact that the knife block was tipped over suggested a struggle, the Post described their attorney, Joseph Podraza, saying.

In early 2021, the Greenbergs shared new forensic evidence of the positions of the stab wounds with CBS Philly, which they say proves she could not have stabbed herself.

A gash on the back of her head could be from a wound that rendered her unconscious and unable to defend herself, the lawsuit suggested, per the Post.

Representatives of the city of Philadelphia argued that the courts have no authority to overturn the medical examiner's decision.

In any case, a determination of suicide would not prevent police investigating a homicide, the Post reported."

Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert says she’s ‘tired of this separation of church and state junk’,https://www.deseret.com/2022/6/28/23186621/lauren-boebert-separation-of-church-and-state-colorado-primary-elections-first-amendment,nottheonion,"During a worship service in Colorado on Sunday, Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., told the congregation she is “tired of this separation of church and state junk” in the U.S.

In her remarks given at the Cornerstone Christian Center, Boebert said the only reason the U.S. has so many “overreaching regulations” on religion is because “the church complied.”

Boebert, who is on the ballot in Tuesday’s primary election, said to worshipers, “The church is supposed to direct the government. The government is not supposed to direct the church. That is not how our Founding Fathers intended it.”

She added the concept of separation of church and state isn’t in the Constitution and only comes from a “stinking letter” written by one of the Founding Fathers.

In a video recording posted to YouTube, the audience cheered on Boebert’s statement.

Some political experts told the Denver Post Boebert’s comments were likely inspired by recent Supreme Court rulings. Boebert praised the decision to overturn Roe v. Wade during her remarks.

The specific phrase “separation of church and State” comes from a letter written by Thomas Jefferson in 1803 to interpret the First Amendment.

The phrase has since been used by the Supreme Court to interpret the establishment clause of the First Amendment, which reads “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.”

The Supreme Court first cited the letter in Reynolds v. United States, where a Utah man argued a federal law prohibiting polygamy violated his right to free exercise of religion as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Gwen Calais-Haase, a political scientist at Harvard University, told the Washington Post the Colorado representative’s interpretation of the Constitution was “false, misleading and dangerous.”

Former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele tweeted the video of Boebert’s remarks saying “I can’t. Not today.”

Boebert faces her Republican opponent Don Coram on Tuesday in the Colorado Republican primary. The New York Times reported that thousands of Democrats in Colorado have registered as Republicans in Colorado in hopes of ousting Boebert in the primaries by voting for her opponent.

Democrats in Colorado have disapproved of Boebert’s strong support for former President Donald Trump and say she embodies extremism and authoritarianism."
"Embryos can be listed as dependents on tax returns, Georgia rules",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/02/georgia-embyros-tax-dependents-fetus,nottheonion,"Georgia taxpayers can now list embryos as dependents on their tax returns.

In a news release on Monday, Georgia’s department of revenue said it would begin to “recognize any unborn child with a detectable human heartbeat … as eligible for [an] individual income tax dependent exemption”.

The announcement follows the supreme court’s ruling on 24 June that overturned the landmark Roe v Wade ruling that established the nationwide right to an abortion nearly 50 years earlier. A lower federal appellate court had also decided on 20 July to let the Georgia law banning most abortions in the state take effect.

Officials added that taxpayers filing returns from 20 July onward can claim a deduction of up to $3,000 for any fetus whose heartbeat could be detected. That “may occur as early as six weeks’ gestation”, before most women even know they are pregnant, the statement said.

Taxpayers must be ready to provide “relevant medical records or other supporting documentation … if requested by the [revenue] department”.

Legal analysts and advocates for abortion rights greeted the announcement with dismay and skepticism.

Anthony Michael Kreis, a Georgia State University law professor and political scientist, tweeted that some pregnancies detected within six weeks of gestation “result in natural miscarriages”, which could leave the Georgia’s treasury “handing out a lot of cash for pregnancies that would never come to term”.

And given how high the percentage of pregnancies that result in natural miscarriages, the treasury is going to be handing out a lot of cash for pregnancies that would never come to term. (That might be good public health policy though it may be a lot more money than anticipated.) — Anthony Michael Kreis (@AnthonyMKreis) August 1, 2022

Lauren Groh-Wargo, manager of Stacey Abrams’s campaign for Georgia governor, tweeted: “So what happens when you claim your fetus as a dependent and then miscarry later in the pregnancy, you get investigated both for [possible] tax fraud and an illegal abortion?”

The Georgia revenue department’s announcement Monday came less than a month after a pregnant woman in Texas memorably argued to police that her unborn child should count as an additional passenger upon receiving a traffic ticket for driving alone in a high-occupancy – or HOV – lane. The woman didn’t talk her way out of the ticket but has said she plans to go to court to try out her argument there.

More than half the states in America have either banned or are expected to ban abortion after the supreme court returned regulation of abortion to the state level. Bans like Georgia’s have forced patients seeking abortions to travel hundreds of miles from home, at times placing them, their friends, their families and abortion rights organizations in legal jeopardy as some states seek to criminalize helping people terminate pregnancies."
"""Kid Rock says ‘F@#% Dr. Fauci,’ chants ‘Let’s go Brandon,’ calls for unity in new song""",https://www.mlive.com/life/2022/01/kid-rock-says-f-dr-fauci-chants-lets-go-brandon-calls-for-unity-in-new-song.html,nottheonion,"UPDATE: Kid Rock’s ‘We The People’ skyrockets to No. 1 on iTunes

Kid Rock got a lot off of his chest in his new song, “We The People,” which may or may not be part of his upcoming new album, “Bad Reputation,” set to be released sometime this year.

The song is one of three Rock just released after announcing a big concert tour for 2022 which sees him performing at Van Andel Arena on Saturday, April 16 and at Pine Knob Music Theatre on Friday, Sept. 16 and the following night. Rock also hinted this could be his final big tour ever.

In his new song, “We The People,” the always candid and outspoken rocker from Metro Detroit blasts President Joe Biden, Dr. Anthony Fauci, Facebook, Twitter, TMZ and the media as he addresses hot button issues like COVID-19, inflation, and Black Lives Matter.

“Wear your mask, take your pills, Now a whole generation’s mentally ill,” Rock sings toward the beginning of the song which goes on to say “(Hey-yeah) man, F--- Fauci (Hey-yeah). But COVID’s near, it’s coming to town. We gotta act quick, shut our borders down. Joe Biden does, the media embraces. Big Don does it and they call him racist.”

The song’s chorus chants multiple times, “We the people (ooh, let’s go Brandon).” The phrase “Let’s go Brandon” is code for a profanity-laced insult directed at Biden.

The song continues with Rock attacking social media channels and the media before addressing some current events.

“Inflation’s up, like the minimum wage, so it’s all the same, it ain’t a damn thing changed. (Hey-yeah Hey-yeah). You piece of s---, I don’t see color. ”Black lives matter”, no s---- MF. (Hey-yeah Hey-yeah).

Rock then calls for unity in the song.

“But we gotta keep fighting for the right to be free and every human being doesn’t have to agree. We all bleed red, brother, listen to me, it’s time for love and unity.”

He then blasts CNN, TMZ and social media trolls before asking for people to come together.

“If you down with love and wanna make things better, all we gotta do is just come together. Weather the storm, and take my hand, then follow my lead to the promised land. ’Cause we the people, we gotta unite to follow that good time guiding light. Climb aboard this love boat and rock that b---- up and down the coast. In order to form a more perfect union, do ordain and establish this constitution for the United States of America.”

The song chants “Let’s Go Brandon” towards the end before Rock says this: “Standing up, and standing tall, cause it’s all for one and it’s one for all. All, all, all. We the people (ooh) We the people.”

The song then ends with more “Let’s Go Brandon” chants."
Miss England finalist becomes first in pageant's history to compete without makeup,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/miss-england-finalist-no-makeup-intl-scli-gbr/index.html,nottheonion,"Written by Jacqui Palumbo Toyin Owoseje, CNN

A Miss England finalist has become the first ever beauty queen to compete without wearing any makeup in the pageant's nearly century-long history.

Melisa Raouf, a 20-year-old college student from south London, moved forward at the pageant's semifinals on Monday after opting for a barefaced look. Now, she'll compete in the finals this October for the crown.

""It means a lot to me as I feel many girls of different ages wear makeup because they feel pressured to do so,"" Raouf said in an interview with the UK's Independent newspaper.

""If one is happy in their own skin we should not be made to cover up our face with makeup. Our flaws make us who we are and that's what makes every individual unique,"" she added.

Raouf said that, though she started wearing makeup at a young age, she decided to eschew tradition for the pageant.

""I never felt I met beauty standards. I have recently accepted that I am beautiful in my own skin and that's why I decided to compete with no makeup,"" she explained in the interview.

In May, Raouf posted a selfie on Instagram from the ""bare face"" round of the competition, writing that she was ""embracing blemishes and imperfections.""

CNN has contacted Raouf for further comment.

Angie Beasley, director of Miss England, told CNN in a statement on Friday: ""We introduced the Bare Face Top Model round in 2019 as most contestants were submitting highly edited images wearing lots of makeup and we wanted to see the real person behind the makeup.""

According to organizers, Raouf plans to go bare-faced again at the national final in October.

""We wish her the best of luck in Miss England, it's a very brave thing to do when everyone else is wearing makeup but she's sending out an important message to young women,"" Beasley added."
"‘Florida is the place where woke goes to die,’ DeSantis says",https://www.wfla.com/news/pasco-county/florida-is-the-place-where-woke-goes-to-die-desantis-says/,nottheonion,"NEW PORT RICHEY, Fla. (WFLA) — Gov. Ron DeSantis visited Pasco County Tuesday morning to discuss teacher recruitment efforts. While in New Port Richey, he spoke about Florida’s new curriculum and efforts to keep indoctrination and ideology out of the state’s schools, and pushed back on medical board efforts to include gender dysphoria care for minors.

During the news conference, DeSantis spoke about reopening schools during the COVID-19 pandemic, not forcing students to be vaccinated, and the state’s viewpoint that pandemic lockdown efforts should be focused on science and data, not on political ideology and partisan strategies.

He said places like Washington, D.C., had retained vaccination requirements, at the expense of excluding children from school based on “a mandate that has no basis in science or fact.” The governor said lockdown policies hurt low-income students the most.

The governor then took questions from the crowd. During the question and answer session, DeSantis was asked about a reported effort to recruit teachers from foreign countries to address the current teacher shortage.

“With everything, I think that we’re putting Floridians first, we’re putting Americans first. If we have a qualified teacher in the United States or in Florida, I don’t want to go with a foreigner over somebody that’s from our communities,” DeSantis said. “There’s nothing wrong with, in some situations, I don’t know how it would work, with what they’re doing, but clearly we believe in putting the people here in Florida first. Our programs are designed to benefit Floridians, not people in other countries.”

While answering another education question, DeSantis said teaching was not being pursued as a career in colleges as much as in past time periods. He said the state had worked on improving average minimum salaries for Florida teachers as part of an initiative to recruit more educators, but said the way schools taught education to become teachers was less effective than the past.

“I think these schools of education and the specific way they go about, I don’t think is the right way to do it,” DeSantis said. “I don’t think these [education] schools have proven to be effective. I think what you do is you get people that have proficiency in core academic disciplines, then you have them go in. But trying to teach them at certain schools of education, I think that’s been overtaken by ideology. I think that’s a turn-off for a lot of people.”

The governor said most people who get into teaching as a profession do it to help students, not to be “a cog in some indoctrination machine.” Talking about Florida’s approach to curriculum, the governor continued along that thread of thought.

“Our mantra has been, in our schools, to educate kids, not indoctrinate kids,” DeSantis said. “Hopefully what we’re doing is saying that teaching is not about learning ‘education in college or university,’ it’s really about having proficiency in subjects, then learning on the ground about how to do it.”

He said some people can do well in a college course but, in the classroom, they’re just “not up to snuff.” The governor added that people who may not have done as well in university courses but had “real energy and connect with students” do a better job in some teaching settings.

“It’s something you can’t judge on an academic transcript,” he said. “Certainly, we would prefer people with real world experience and academic proficiency in the core subjects they’re teaching, English, math, science. Not saying ‘oh I went to the school of education somewhere and they taught me kind of how to teach.”

He said he had been “underwhelmed by it” and that those education schools had been “magnets for ideology” at the expense of facts.

DeSantis also addressed how he said ideology had affected the medical field, discussing gender reassignment surgeries among minors and gender dysphoria.

“If you look what’s happening in our society, you see institutions being infected with ideology at the expense of facts and reality. We’re fighting this thing with the medical board because they want to do sex change operations for minors,” DeSantis said. “A 14-year-old cannot get a tattoo, but they are talking, they will do mastectomies and things at the bottom which are very problematic and irreversible. These are kids going through a growing time in their life, there’s a lot of different factors, most of the dysphoria resolves itself by the time they become adults. So why would you disfigure a minor to be able to do?”

DeSantis said the “medical establishment” had “globbed” onto the idea, saying it was something they may view as “an opportunity” but also that he wasn’t sure how they “were couching it.”

The governor said it was a lot of ideology, instead of data, being put into the medical field. In that vein, he again referenced COVID mitigation policies such as masking and school closures, saying the medical professional who said those things were similarly wrong at the time.

“It was not grounded in data, it was not grounded in evidence,” DeSantis said, describing how mask icons and syringe pictures had “taken over” people’s identities online. “They lied to us about the mRNA shots, they said if you take it you will not get COVID. That is false, that is not true, and they continue to say, even when the evidence is so overwhelming, that not only is that not true, people that have multiple boosters, you definitely have risk… Time and time again, you see ideology being placed over data and evidence.”

In June, DeSantis made similar claims about the COVID-19 vaccines while at an event in Callahan. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, still promote vaccination, and still say the vaccines are safe and effective. Neither agency claims the vaccines are 100% effective, but stand by the vaccines as a way to mitigate infection and symptoms. The governor did not provide data to support his claims at the event on Tuesday.

The governor said due to incorrect ideology, people will “constantly shift” rather than admit they’re wrong, and listed off going up against a variety of people and organizations on behalf of Floridians, such as “woke corporations” and the Environmental Social Governance business rating system.

“Obviously in the classroom we’ve battled a lot of ideologies. What I’ve said is the state of Florida is the place where woke goes to die,” he said. “We are not going to let this state descend into some type of woke dumpster fire. We’re going to be following common sense, we’re going to be following facts.”"
"In Unusual Decision, Ron DeSantis Will Personally Map Florida Congressional Districts",https://themountain.news/news/in-unusual-decision-ron-desantis-will-personally-map-florida-congressional-districts,nottheonion,"Florida’s legislative branch has given Governor Ron DeSantis the power to draft Florida’s new congressional districts used in future elections. This unusual decision has blurred the lines between different branches of government and has given the ambitious governor of Florida the power to gerrymander the twenty-eight congressional districts of Florida to whatever his liking. DeSantis’s proposed map was rated F by the Princeton Gerrymandering Project for Partisan Fairness. Opponents have declared it unconstitutional.

Two weeks ago Governor DeSantis vetoed a congressional map proposed by Florida’s Senate and then summoned Florida’s legislators back into a special session to draw a new plan. There has been a feud between DeSantis and the Republican-controlled Florida legislature. DeSantis broke with tradition and proposed his own congressional redistricting plan that favored more Republicans than a plan that had been developed by the Florida Senate. For two months the governor tried and failed to get lawmakers to agree to his approach to redistricting, which argues that the protections afforded to African American voters in Jacksonville and Orlando were an “illegal gerrymander” because he says the courts have since determined that race should not take precedence over the 14th Amendment provisions of equal protection. Since this fight, the legislature has yielded to DeSantis and informed staff that they will not be drafting or producing a map to introduce. Instead, the Republican-dominated legislature will wait for the governor’s office to provide them with a map that they will support. “We are awaiting a communication from the Governor’s Office with a map that he will support. Our intention is to provide the Governor’s Office opportunities to present that information before House and Senate redistricting committees,” House Speaker Chris Sprowls and Senate President Wilton Simpson said in a memo to members shared with NBC News.

Meanwhile, Democrats within the Florida legislature were outraged. State Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith declared that the legislature had “totally surrendered its authority as a separate and equal branch of government.” Abel Iraola, a spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee warned that the decision was “an unprecedented and shameless abdication of [The Legislature’s] responsibilities as an elected body[.]” Even longtime members of the Republican party were shocked. “The legislature has abdicated its responsibility, the leaders in the Republican Party in the legislature have abandoned all principle. It’s just all about maintaining and acquiring power and holding on to office,” said Mac Stipanovich, a life-long Republican who left the party after Trump was elected, to the Washington Post. “What we’re witnessing is a mile marker on the road to one-man rule in Florida, at least for the time being.” Governor DeSantis has used his position as governor and a major player in Republican politics to subdue Republicans in the Legislature. “More and more, we’ve been hearing that Ron [DeSantis] has been making it clear to the leadership ... that, ‘If you defy me on the map, I’m going to support primary opponents, I’m going to veto your budget items.’ ” explained Matt Isbell, founder of MCI Maps and a Florida redistricting expert.

With midterm elections fast approaching, a new congressional map could decisively affect the composition of Florida’s representatives. The last day for a candidate to qualify to run for Congress in Florida is June 17th, and primary elections are on August 23rd. As a new seat in Congress was awarded as a result of Florida’s population growth a new electoral map is required to accommodate Florida’s new district is required. This means Florida can not reuse an old congressional map for 2022. The DeSantis map is likely to face legal scrutiny, meaning a complex legal battle in the courts is likely to run parallel to the 2022 midterm elections. DeSantis’s proposed map would eliminate two House districts represented by Black Democrats. Opponents criticized the decision as a clear violation of a state constitutional amendment known as Fair Districts, which requires lawmakers to give minority communities an opportunity to “elect representatives of their choice.” The Fair Districts amendment was approved by voters in a ballot referendum last decade to reduce political influence in the map-drawing process.

While DeSantis subdues Florida’s Republicans, he could have higher ambitions. There is a very real possibility that Ron DeSantis could run for president in 2024. An informal straw poll done at the Conservative Political Action Conference showed DeSantis coming in second place (behind Trump) in a hypothetical 2024 primary election. Ron DeSantis has already raised more than $100 million for his 2022 reelection bid, a stunning sum that demonstrates his power to raise money and speaks for his ambitions outside the Sunshine State."
Alaska snow crab season canceled as officials investigate disappearance of an estimated 1 billion crabs,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fishing-alaska-snow-crab-season-canceled-investigation-climate-change/,nottheonion,"In a major blow to America's seafood industry, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game has, for the first time in state history, canceled the winter snow crab season in the Bering Sea due to their falling numbers. While restaurant menus will suffer, scientists worry what the sudden population plunge means for the health of the Arctic ecosystem.

An estimated one billion crabs have mysteriously disappeared in two years, state officials said. It marks a 90% drop in their population.

Freshly caught snow crabs sit in containers on a fishing boat at Mikuni Fishing Port in Mikuni, Fukui Prefecture, Japan, on Friday, Nov. 6, 2015. Buddhika Weerasinghe/Bloomberg via Getty Images

""Did they run up north to get that colder water?"" asked Gabriel Prout, whose Kodiak Island fishing business relies heavily on the snow crab population. ""Did they completely cross the border? Did they walk off the continental shelf on the edge there, over the Bering Sea?""

Ben Daly, a researcher with ADF&G, is investigating where the crabs have gone. He monitors the health of the state's fisheries, which produce 60% of the nation's seafood.

""Disease is one possibility,"" Daly told CBS News.

He also points to climate change. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Alaska is the fastest warming state in the country, and is losing billions of tons of ice each year — critical for crabs that need cold water to survive.

""Environmental conditions are changing rapidly,"" Daly said. ""We've seen warm conditions in the Bering Sea the last couple of years, and we're seeing a response in a cold adapted species, so it's pretty obvious this is connected. It is a canary in a coal mine for other species that need cold water.""

Prout said that there needs to be a relief program for fisherman, similar to programs for farmers who experience crop failure, or communities affected by hurricanes or flooding.

When asked what fishermen can do in this situation, with their livelihoods dependent on the ocean, Prout responded, ""Hope and pray. I guess that's the best way to say it."""

This reporting was supported by the International Women's Media Foundation's Reproductive Rights Reporting Fund.December 2020 was a turbulent month for Danielle Drake, 32, of Lake of the Ozarks. On December 1, her husband said he was going out with a friend, but he lied. He was actually having an affair. She filed for a divorce less than a week later, on December 7.Then, not long before Christmas, Drake found out she was pregnant.Drake knew immediately she had to file a second, amended petition for divorce. She also knew the impact her pregnancy would have on the divorce proceedings. Drake, who earned a law degree from University of Missouri Kansas City has been practicing family law for two years, was well aware that in Missouri, women who are pregnant can't get a divorce.Missouri law states that a petition for divorce must provide eight pieces of information , things like the residence of each party, the date of separation, and, notably, “whether the wife is pregnant.” If the answer is yes, Drake says, ""What that practically does is put your case on hold.""There is a lot of disagreement online about whether pregnant Missouri women can get divorced. Thespoke to multiple lawyers who handle divorce proceedings and they all agreed that in Missouri a divorce can't be finalized if either the petitioner (the person who files for divorce) or the respondent (the other party in the divorce) is pregnant.Dan Mizell, an attorney in Lebanon, Missouri, who has been practicing law since 1997, says that certain aspects of the divorce can proceed, but everything having to do with custody of the unborn child is frozen in place until birth or a pregnancy-ending event like a miscarriage. The court can issue temporary orders related to things like dividing up property, Mizell says. ""But they can't do a final decree of divorce until she delivers the baby.""Drake says that this is true even in the case of a divorce that is completely uncontested. ""If the couple is not fighting, and they're just saying, ‘Nope, she's gonna take the baby and 100 percent of the things’ they still cannot go before a judge and have that finalized until after there's a baby born,"" she says.""It is a shock to some people,"" Mizell adds. ""Sometimes it comes up at the very last minute, because the wife is usually asked to say under oath whether she is pregnant or not, which can be offensive at times, and also a bit ridiculous at others.""Drake also points out what seems to be a double standard in regards to how the state treats an unborn child in a divorce proceeding compared to in abortion law.She says that the whole basis for Missouri putting the pause on a divorce proceeding until a child is born is because Missouri divorce law ""does not see fetuses as humans.""""You can't have a court order that dictates visitation and child support for a child that doesn't exist,"" she says. ""I have no mechanism as a lawyer to get that support going. There's nothing there because that's not a real person.""This aspect of Missouri divorce law has gotten more attention in the weeks since the Supreme Court overturned, triggering a ban on abortion in Missouri except in cases of medical emergency. Though what is meant by medical emergency is still ambiguous.""This all goes back to the fact that we don't trust women,"" says Jess Piper, an outspoken advocate for reproductive rights who is running as a Democrat to be the state representative for the 1st District, in the rural northwest corner of the state. ""I've heard actual reports of women who have been in domestic violence situations where their husbands withheld birth control from them, purposely creating a pregnancy so that she can't leave.""Piper adds that for some women, the new abortion law in Missouri will be just another obstacle in what can already be a fraught process of leaving a marriage.Drake and Mizell both say the law is in need of updating.Mizell says that even if the woman is pregnant by a man other than her husband, the divorce is still on hold.Drake says that this outdated law is symptomatic of a much larger issue in family law, which is that the ""large and clunky legal system"" provides only a one-size-fits-all approach, but no two families are alike.""It's very, very hard to write broad, sweeping laws with families, because every family is different. Every family has unique circumstances.""Drake's divorce is still working its way through the courts. Her son was born in August 2021, and she filed a third petition, this time affirming to the state she is in fact not pregnant."
‘Watchmen’ Creator Alan Moore: Adults Loving Superhero Movies Is ‘Infantile’ and Can Be a ‘Precursor to Fascism’,https://variety.com/2022/film/news/alan-moore-adults-loving-superhero-movies-fascism-1235397695/,nottheonion,"“Watchmen” creator Alan Moore’s hatred for superhero movies is well known, as he once called them a “blight” to cinema and “also to culture to a degree,” but he dragged them even more during a recent interview with The Guardian. Moore described adults’ continued love of superhero movies an “infantilization” that can act as “a precursor to fascism.”

“I said round about 2011 that I thought that it had serious and worrying implications for the future if millions of adults were queueing up to see ‘Batman’ movies,” Moore said. “Because that kind of infantilization – that urge towards simpler times, simpler realities – that can very often be a precursor to fascism.”

Moore expressed worry with the notion that “hundreds of thousands of adults” are now “lining up to see characters and situations that had been created to entertain the 12-year-old boys — and it was always boys — of 50 years ago.”

“I didn’t really think that superheroes were adult fare,” Moore said. “I think that this was a misunderstanding born of what happened in the 1980s — to which I must put my hand up to a considerable share of the blame, though it was not intentional — when things like ‘Watchmen’ were first appearing. There were an awful lot of headlines saying ‘Comics Have Grown Up’.”

Moore continued, “I tend to think that, no, comics hadn’t grown up. There were a few titles that were more adult than people were used to. But the majority of comics titles were pretty much the same as they’d ever been. It wasn’t comics growing up. I think it was more comics meeting the emotional age of the audience coming the other way… I will always love and adore the comics medium but the comics industry and all of the stuff attached to it just became unbearable.”

In an Oct. 2020 interview, Moore revealed that he had not seen a superhero movie since Tim Burton’s original “Batman” in 1989. He added, “I don’t watch any of them. All of these characters have been stolen from their original creators, all of them… if you try to make them for the adult world then I think it becomes kind of grotesque.”"

Tops Employee Says 911 Hung Up On Her During Buffalo Mass Shooting,https://www.binnews.com/content/2022-05-16-tops-employee-says-911-hung-up-on-her-during-buffalo-mass-shooting/,nottheonion,"A Tops assistant manager who called emergency services during the fatal Buffalo shooting says the 911 operator that answered had an attitude and ultimately hung up in her face.

On Saturday (May 14), Payton Gendron, the suspected shooter, killed 10 Black New Yorkers in a ""racially-motivated hate crime"" at Tops supermarket. The assistant manager, Latisha, says she dialed 911 after the gunman opened fire, but the dispatcher who picked up yelled at her and ended the call.

When asked to describe the fatal scene, Latisha told WRGZ, ""I didn't really see much at all. I just heard the gunshots and just dropped down to the ground and just waited for him to stop and he just wouldn't stop.""

The assistant manager said she whispered while speaking with 911 services because she could hear the gunman nearby.

""When I whispered on the phone to 911, the dispatcher would start yelling at me saying 'Why are you whispering? You don't have to whisper.' and I'm trying to tell her ma'am he's in the store, he's shooting, it's an active shooter, I'm scared for my life,"" Latisha said describing the call.

The Buffalo woman revealed she had to ask her significant other to call authorities after being met with an attitude on the other side of the line.

""She said something crazy to me, and she hung up in my face. I had to call my boyfriend to tell him to call 911,"" Latisha said.

Buffalo residents are mourning the attack on their close-knit community. Officials say Gendron had plans to continue targeting Black people in the area if he had escaped Tops supermarket.

Texas schools send parents DNA kits to identify their kids’ bodies in emergencies,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/texas-schools-send-parents-dna-kits-identify-kids-bodies-emergencies-rcna52887,nottheonion,"The state of Texas is sending public school students home with DNA kits designed to help their parents identify their children “in case of an emergency.”

In 2021, the Texas state legislature passed Senate Bill No. 2158, a law requiring the Texas Education Agency to “provide identification kits to school districts and open-enrollment charter schools for distribution to the parent or legal custodian of certain students.”

The law passed after eight students and two teachers were shot and killed inside Santa Fe High School in Santa Fe, Texas, and almost a year before 19 fourth-graders and two teachers were gunned down inside Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas.

The Texas public school system will provide ink-free fingerprint and DNA identification cards to all K-6 students who are eligible. Parents are not mandated to use the kits.

The three-fold pamphlets allow caregivers to store their children’s DNA and fingerprints at home, which could then be turned over to law enforcement agencies in the event of an “emergency.” According to the legislation mandating the kits be provided to qualifying Texas families, the fingerprint and DNA verification kits were intended to “help locate and return a missing or trafficked child.”

In the wake of the second deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history and the botched police response that left 19 students and two teachers dead, Texas parents are apprehensive about the kits and the message some are saying it sends to Texas families.

Many of the children gunned down inside Robb Elementary were not easily identifiable as a result of their catastrophic injuries. Some close family members provided DNA swabs in order to positively identify the children’s remains.

Tracy Walder, a former CIA and FBI agent and current college professor who taught high school history for 16 years, said she was “devastated” when she heard her second-grade daughter would be sent home with a kit.

“You have to understand, I’m a former law enforcement officer,” Walder, who has lived in Texas for 14 years, said. ""I worry every single day when I send my kid to school. Now we’re giving parents DNA kits so that when their child is killed with the same weapon of war I had when I was in Afghanistan, parents can use them to identify them?”

Walder said she has tried to “find the right words” for how she feels, but she doesn’t think she can “because sometimes it’s beyond comprehension.”

“This sends two messages: The first is that the government is not going to do anything to solve the problem. This is their way of telling us that,” Walder said. “The second is that us parents are now forced to have conversations with our kids that they may not be emotionally ready for. My daughter is 7. What do I tell her?”

Brett Cross, whose 10-year-old son Uziyah Garcia was killed in the Robb Elementary School shooting, shared his frustration over the kits on social media.

“Yeah! Awesome! Let’s identify kids after they’ve been murdered instead of fixing issues that could ultimately prevent them from being murdered,” Cross posted on Twitter.

Texas State Sen. Donna Campbell, who sponsored SB-2158, and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott did not respond to requests for comment.

A spokesperson for the Texas Education Agency said in a written statement provided to TODAY that “Senate Bill 2158 established the Child Identification Program, a grant to supply child I.D. fingerprint and DNA identification kits to school systems to provide to families in their respective school communities,” adding that “parents can voluntarily request these kits.”

“To fulfill this statutory obligation, TEA is collaborating with the Safety Blitz Foundation, National Child Identification (I.D.) Program, Education Service Centers, and school systems to provide families who had children in kindergarten through sixth grade during the 2021-2022 school year and kindergarten during the 2022-2023 school year with child I.D. fingerprint kits,” the statement added.

Some parents say they feel uncomfortable sending their children’s DNA to anyone for privacy reasons. And after the tragedy in Uvalde, the kits are making many moms and dads feel even more anxious about sending their children to school.

“It makes me physically sick,” Wendi Aarons, a mom of two who has lived in Texas since 1999, told TODAY Parents. “I have a hard time even grappling with this as a real thing that is happening. Parents of school kids should be worrying about (parent-teacher organization) sign-up sheets and grades and if their kid likes whatever they’re serving in the cafeteria that day, not their child’s murder and if they’re shot so many times their body cannot be identified.”

Aarons has two children, ages 18 and 20, who attended Texas public schools from the time they were in kindergarten until they graduated high school. She said she’s grateful her children will not be sent home with DNA and fingerprint kits, and said she “can’t imagine the panic and anxiety parents face sending their kids to school every day not knowing if they’ll return.”

“It’s astounding, to realize that not only has the state of Texas done absolutely nothing to protect our kids and teachers, they’ve taken the callous, heartless, cruel measure to send DNA test kits so we can identify their bodies if or when they’re victims of a massacre,” Aarons added. “It sends the message that guns are more important than us.”

In June, Emily Westbrooks and her family moved to Texas from Ireland, where she said “gun violence is negligible and sending children to school wasn’t a daily terror.”

“It infuriates me that these kits are being sent to families in lieu of any concrete action to prevent such terrorizing tragedies from occurring,” said Westbrooks, who has a 5-year-old in kindergarten and a 7-year-old in first grade. “I think the only way you can reasonably send your children to school is simply to tell yourself this won’t happen to your kids, which is of course just lying to yourself.”

Westbrooks adds that the kits shatter that lie and are an “incredibly triggering, in-your-face reminder that our kids are at risk of being obliterated by automatic weapons to the point they won’t be recognizable.”

“Elected officials, both national and Texan, have given up,” she added. “They’ve decided our kids aren’t worth restricting guns, but they’re offering us this as some kind of consolation. It’s disgusting that they can’t do any better than to admit that they won’t protect our children.”"
US clinics offer free vasectomies in wake of supreme court’s Roe reversal,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/oct/13/us-vasectomies-planned-parenthood-abortion-roe-v-wade,nottheonion,"Amid a reported surge in demand for vasectomies prompted by the US supreme court ruling that removed the right to abortion, Planned Parenthood and a physician with a mobile vasectomy clinic will offer 60 free vasectomies over three days in St Louis, Springfield and Joplin, Missouri, in the first week of November.

Dr Esgar Guarin plans to take his mobile clinic – a vehicle friends have dubbed the “Nutcracker” – on the road the following week, to offer 40 free vasectomies in towns in Iowa. Guarin also plans to offer discounted vasectomies at his regular clinic in the Des Moines area.

The efforts are part of World Vasectomy Day, which now includes a year-round focus and a host of activities in November.

“It’s a very particular moment in reproductive rights in the United States. And we need to talk about it,” Guarian said, adding that vasectomies are performed far less often than the tubal ligation method of female sterilization, even though they are cheaper, have a shorter recovery and require only local anesthesia.

Guarin, a member of the medical advisory board for World Vasectomy Day, helped offer vasectomies last year at Planned Parenthood in St Louis. The effort was so popular the decision was made to expand it to other cities even before the toppling of Roe v Wade, the 1973 supreme court ruling which previously guaranteed abortion rights, sent demand soaring.

In July, Planned Parenthood of the St Louis Region and Southwest Missouri performed 42 vasectomies, compared with 10 in the same month last year. Female sterilizations rose to 18 from three.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says that in the aftermath of Dobbs v Jackson, the ruling which overturned Roe, it has been hearing similar reports from around the country.

Planned Parenthood does not have national sterilization numbers available for this year. However, its national web page has seen a 53% increase in vasectomy information searches over the last 100 days, a spokesperson said.

Data from Google Trends shows that searches about vasectomies briefly spiked after the leak of the draft majority opinion in Dobbs but reached their highest level after the court released its decision in June.

Dr Doug Stein, a urological surgeon in the Tampa-St Petersburg area, said patient registrations tripled immediately after Dobbs, with many patients under 30.

“I think everybody is busier since the Dobbs decision,” said Stein, who co-founded World Vasectomy Day.

Dr Arnold Bullock, a St Louis urologist who does about 35 vasectomies a month, said that before the decision, patients waited about a month for the procedure. The wait is now two to three months.

In Texas, Dr Koushik Shaw said his Austin Urology Institute saw a spike when Texas enacted a strict abortion law last year and another larger spike after the US supreme court decision. It is now doing 50% more procedures. He said many are for men who saw access to abortion as another option should birth control not work.

“It really pushed family planning to the forefront of people’s thoughts,” he said of the Dobbs decision.

Lawmakers are responding. A California law that will take effect in 2024 will make vasectomies cheaper by allowing patients with private insurance plans to get the procedure at no additional cost.

Dr Margaret Baum, medical director of Planned Parenthood of the St Louis Region and Southwest Missouri, will partner with Guarin to provide free vasectomies in Missouri.

She reported conversations with patients about permanent sterilization, saying: “I think people are afraid, No1, about abortion not being accessible, which is a very real and legitimate fear and in the reality for a large part of folks in our country. And then I think people are also really afraid that what else might be next.”"
Police offered teen McDonald's in exchange for confession to crime someone else committed: attorney,https://abc7chicago.com/waukegan-il-police-department-wrongfully-accused-shooting/11587147/,nottheonion,"The attorney for a teen wrongfully accused by the Waukegan, IL police department of shooting a dollar store employee is asking for an apology.

WAUKEGAN, Ill. (WLS) -- Labeled as a would-be murderer, 15-year-old Martell Williams said he spent two nights last week in lockup at Waukegan's police department.

He was wrongly accused of shooting a local Dollar Store employee in the face on Feb. 4. Surveillance photos of the suspect were released by the police department in the immediate aftermath of the shooting.

""The officers said that multiple people came to him and said it was me,"" said Martell Williams, the teen wrongly accused of shooting the employee.

The high school freshman, who is also on the basketball team, was confirmed to be at a game in Lincolnshire at the time of the shooting. A time-stamped photograph provided by the family helped to clear him.

But the damage had already been done. Williams was pulled out of class in front of all his classmates.

""The dean came down and got me and walked me to her office. And once I reached her office, there were two police officers,"" Williams said. ""As soon as I got in, they didn't tell me nothing, say nothing to me. They just said, 'You're under arrest.'""

Flanked by his mother and his attorney this morning, Williams said officers offered him McDonald's in exchange for a confession. He didn't know what he was being accused of.

""They didn't even tell him a shooting was involved,"" said Kevin O'Connor, Williams' attorney. ""They just said, 'Hey, it wasn't your fault. Just tell us you were defending yourself. Just go ahead and tell us you were there and we will let you go home.'""

And while William's attorney said the teenager's record has been expunged, he has been calling for an immediate public apology that will clear the teenager's name before he goes back to school on Tuesday.

""This is a continuing and ongoing problem,"" O'Connor said. ""The Department of Justice has been here, yet this is still going on, where there are false confessions brought in.""

The City of Waukegan released a statement Monday.

""The city is reviewing the case, but cannot make further public comment at this time,"" the statement said. ""The city has been in contact with the juvenile's family and their attorney.

And while the police department would not directly address what happened with Williams, a spokesperson for the department said the investigation into who actually shot the Dollar Store employee has continued."

Atwood responds to book bans with ‘unburnable’ edition of Handmaid’s Tale,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/24/margaret-atwood-handmaids-tale-unburnable-edition,nottheonion,"Amid political firestorms over books deemed by rightwingers to be unsuitable for school libraries, the author Margaret Atwood has announced an “unburnable” edition of her most famous novel, The Handmaid’s Tale.

The Canadian author, 82, appeared in a short YouTube video to announce the project, attempting to flambé the one-off tome with a flame-thrower.

Announcing the book, Penguin Random House said: “Across the United States and around the world, books are being challenged, banned and even burned. So we created a special edition of a book that’s been challenged and banned for decades.

“Printed and bound using fireproof materials, this edition of Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale was made to be completely un-burnable. It is designed to protect this vital story and stand as a powerful symbol against censorship.”

As described by the Guardian in 2010, the 25th anniversary of publication, The Handmaid’s Tale “tells the story of Offred – not her real name, but the patronymic she has been given by the new regime in an oppressive parallel America of the future – and her role as a Handmaid.

“The Handmaids are forced to provide children by proxy for infertile women of a higher social status, the wives of Commanders. They undergo regular medical tests, and in many ways become invisible, the sum total of their biological parts.”

According to the American Library Association, The Handmaid’s Tale is among books most often challenged or banned in US schools.

In 2006, in an open letter to a school district which attempted to ban the book, Atwood said: “First, the remark: ‘Offensive to Christians’ amazes me. Nowhere in the book is the regime identified as Christian. As for sexual explicitness, The Handmaid’s Tale is a lot less interested in sex than is much of the Bible.”

Atwood’s book has risen to new prominence thanks to a TV adaptation starring Elisabeth Moss and a 2019 sequel, The Testaments, which won Atwood a second Booker prize. “Handmaid” costumes, red cloaks with white headdresses, have become a familiar sight at protests for reproductive and women’s rights.

The auction of an “unburnable” edition of The Handmaid’s Tale comes ahead of an expected ruling reversing the right to abortion, to be handed down by a supreme court dominated by conservative justices.

In a new essay collection, Burning Questions, Atwood writes: “Women who cannot make their own decisions about whether or not to have babies are enslaved because the state claims ownership of their bodies and the right to dictate the use to which their bodies must be put.”

Her “unburnable” book is being auctioned by Sotheby’s in New York until 7 June. By mid-morning on Tuesday, the price stood at $40,000. All proceeds will go to support Pen America in its “work in support of free expression”.

Hosting a Pen gala in New York on Monday night, Faith Salie, a writer and comedian, said the book was “made to withstand not only the fire-breathing censors and blazing bigots but actual flames – the ones they would like to use to burn down our democracy”."
School teacher suspended after using image of Bin Laden in attempt to portray Prophet Muhammad in lesson,https://news.sky.com/story/school-teacher-suspended-after-using-image-of-bin-laden-in-attempt-to-portray-prophet-muhammad-in-lesson-12554458,nottheonion,"A teacher has been suspended after using an image of Osama bin Laden to portray the Prophet Muhammad during a religious studies lesson.

Year 10 students were shown an image of the 9/11 terrorist in a class at All Saints Academy, in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, last Friday.

It is unclear why the image was used.

Most Muslims consider depictions of Muhammad, or any of the other prophets of Islam, to be deeply offensive.

The school said it became aware of the incident after a ""concerned student"" raised the alarm, with the member of staff being ""suspended immediately"".

All Saints Academy Dunstable later issued a statement apologising ""unreservedly and sincerely"" for the distress the incident caused.

The statement added: “All Saints Academy recognises the deep hurt and distress that has been caused to the Muslim community, and many other people of faith, by the totally inappropriate images that were used as part of a recent RS lesson.

“Not only was it offensive to attempt to portray an image of the prophet Muhammad, but the image that was used was that of Osama bin Laden, a terrorist leader, which further added to the deep insult.

“The academy reiterates its unreserved and sincere apology for the distress this episode has caused. In terms of actions taken, we are happy to share the following information.”

All Saints Academy is described on its website as a Church of England school.

The woman took photos. When McGarity fell asleep, she told the flight crew what happened. They moved her to another seat on the flight.

The woman turned the photos over to Phoenix police when the flight landed.

The FBI interviewed him and says he didn't think the female passenger was uncomfortable with him masturbating and he thought ""it was kind of kinky.""

McGarity is facing charges related to lewd, indecent, or obscene acts.

Nazi sympathizer and Jan. 6 rioter who claimed he didn't know Congress met at Capitol to be sentenced Thursday,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/nazi-sympathizer-jan-6-rioter-claimed-didnt-know-congress-met-capitol-rcna48677,nottheonion,"WASHINGTON — A Jan. 6 rioter who has dressed up as Adolf Hitler and held a security clearance was sentenced to four years in federal prison Thursday.

Timothy Hale-Cusanelli, 32, of New Jersey, who was an Army reservist when he stormed the U.S. Capitol in January 2021, was convicted in May after he failed to convince jurors that he didn’t know that Congress met at the Capitol, a claim he made on the stand to avoid a conviction for obstruction of Congress.

“I know this sounds idiotic, but I’m from New Jersey,” Hale-Cusanelli told jurors when he said he didn't know Congress met at the Capitol. “I feel like an idiot, it sounds idiotic, and it is.”

U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden, a Trump-appointed judge who oversaw Hale-Cusanelli’s trial, had said his testimony was ""highly dubious"" and indicated that he was open to a sentencing enhancement. McFadden said Thursday that the claim that Hale-Cusanelli didn't know Congress met at the Capitol was a ""risible lie"" and an ""obvious attempt"" to avoid accountability.

McFadden said Hale-Cusanelli ""absolutely knew"" that Congress met at the Capitol, noting that he had even told his roommate that he was outside the House of Representatives on Jan. 6. McFadden also said he was ""appalled"" by the language Hale-Cusanelli used to a female officer on Jan. 6, in which he called her an unprintable word.

Hale-Cusanelli told the judge ahead of his sentencing that he owed members of Congress and law enforcement an apology.

""I disgraced my uniform and I disgraced the country,"" he said. ""I do say ugly things"" that are ""repugnant"" in the eyes of many, he said. He assured the judge that he would ""never see my face in court after this"" and that the time he spent in solitary confinement had changed who he was.

Federal prosecutors had sought 6½ years in prison. Hale-Cusanelli was convicted on all five counts he faced, including a felony charge of obstruction of an official proceeding. McFadden found, however, that a lower sentencing range should apply because interfering with the certification of the Electoral College vote didn’t qualify as interfering with the ""administration of justice.""

In a government sentencing memo, federal prosecutors referred to Hale-Cusanelli’s “enthusiasm for civil war and his well-documented history of violent rhetoric” and argued that significant prison time is warranted because of his background and his false statements on the stand.

""A student of history and government who had previously explained the intricacies of Presidential election procedure to his friends, Hale-Cusanelli falsely testified at trial that he did not know that: (a) 'Congress' sat in the Capitol building; (b) the Electoral College Certification Proceeding was taking place in the building; and (c) when he entered the Capitol, members of Congress were still there, having fled and hidden from the mob,"" they wrote. ""Hale-Cusanelli lied on the stand.""

Prosecutors also said Hale-Cusanelli “subscribes to White Supremacist and Nazi-Sympathizer ideologies that drive his enthusiasm for another civil war.” The jury saw only a fraction of the government's evidence of extremist views held by Hale-Cusanelli, a former security contractor who previously had a ""secret"" security clearance.

“Hale-Cusanelli is, at best, extremely tolerant of violence and death,” prosecutors said. “What Hale-Cusanelli was doing on January 6 was not activism, it was the preamble to his civil war.”

Hale-Cusanelli's lawyer said in a defense sentencing memo that the court will hear from Hale-Cusanelli ""that he regrets his actions, deplores the violence and property destruction at the Capitol, and apologizes to members of Congress, congressional staff, and law enforcement for his part in the events.""

Timothy Hale-Cusanelli. U.S. District Court

The government sentencing memo refers to Hale-Cusanelli’s adoptive aunt, Cynthia Hughes, who spoke at a Trump rally in Pennsylvania this month. The memo mentions her role with the Patriot Freedom Project, a group that has supported Jan. 6 defendants, and points to publicly reported information that prosecutors say “fairly supports an inference that Hale-Cusanelli and Hughes have used the January 6 attack on the Capitol and the notoriety of Hale-Cusanelli’s case — which Hughes herself has exacerbated via her public and media appearances — to enrich themselves.” A footnote in the government's memo mentions former President Donald Trump’s rally on Sept. 3.

Hughes wrote a letter in support of Hale-Cusanelli, saying he “is not a violent person; he doesn’t walk around the streets of NJ looking like Hitler.”

Hughes was in court Thursday for Hale-Cusanelli’s sentencing but did not respond to questions from reporters when she left with a man who appeared to be her bodyguard.

Even though government court filings noted that 34 of Hale-Cusanelli’s co-workers told investigators that he held “extremist or radical views pertaining to the Jewish people, minorities, and women”; that he attended a Black Lives Matter protest carrying a “clipboard full of statistics” in hopes someone would “debate him” about differences between races; and that he was arrested with two others 12 years ago and accused of using a “potato gun” bearing the words “WHITE IS RIGHT,” his aunt said in a letter to the court that there “is not a racist bone in his body.”

Prosecutors said it was clear Hale-Cusanelli isn’t sorry about his actions on Jan. 6.

“Hale-Cusanelli’s self-serving statements at trial that he was wrong to enter the Capitol and that he was sorry that he did should be given the same weight as his self-serving claims that he did not know Congress was in the Capitol building — which is to say, none,"" they wrote.

Despite Hale-Cusanelli's attempts to portray his Hitler photo as a joke, McFadden said, ""the evidence shows otherwise."" McFadden said a supervisor had to counsel Hale-Cusanelli about his Hitler-style mustache, and said it was abundantly clear that he holds animus toward racial and religious groups, and had ""sexist, racist, and antisemitic"" views.

Hale-Cusanelli is one of more than 250 defendants tied to Jan. 6 who have been sentenced, and among the 130-plus who have received a period of incarceration. The longest prison sentence — 10 years — was handed down to a former NYPD officer who assaulted a D.C. police officer with a flag pole and then tackled him to the ground.

More than 850 defendants have been arrested in connection with the attack on the Capitol, and there are hundreds of arrests in the pipeline."
"Jordan Peterson Breaks Down in Tears When Asked About Olivia Wilde Calling Him a ‘Hero to the Incel Community’: ‘Sure, Why Not?’",https://variety.com/2022/film/news/jordan-peterson-cries-olivia-wilde-incel-hero-dont-worry-darling-1235388024/,nottheonion,"Jordan Peterson broke down in tears during an interview on “Piers Morgan Uncensored” (via Mediaite) when asked about Olivia Wilde referring to him as “a hero to the incel community.” Wilde was on her “Don’t Worry Darling” press tour when she revealed to Interview Magazine that Chris Pine’s villainous character in the film, Frank, is based on Peterson. Wilde called Peterson “this pseudo-intellectual hero to the incel community.”

“Sure. Why not?” Peterson said when Piers Morgan asked if Wilde’s assessment of him was true. “You know, people have been after me for a long time because I’ve been speaking to disaffected young men.”

Peterson then broke down into tears and said, “It’s very difficult to understand how demoralized people are, and certainly many young men are in that category. You get these casual insults, these incels — what do they mean? These men, they don’t know how to make themselves attractive to women who are very picky, and good for them. Women, like, be picky. That’s your gift, man. Demand high standards from your men. Fair enough. But all these men who are alienated, it’s like they’re lonesome and they don’t know what to do and everyone piles abuse on them.”

After calling Peterson a “hero to incel community,” Wilde described incels as “disenfranchised, mostly white men, who believe they are entitled to sex from women. And they believe that society has now robbed them — that the idea of feminism is working against nature, and that we must be put back into the correct place.”

“This guy Jordan Peterson is someone that legitimizes certain aspects of their movement because he’s a former professor, he’s an author, he wears a suit, so they feel like this is a real philosophy that should be taken seriously,” Wilde added.

Peterson told Morgan that he wasn’t too offended by Wilde’s comment (it was a “low-level” insult, he said). Instead, the diss convinced Peterson to check out the “Don’t Worry Darling” trailer.

“I thought, ‘I’d go see that movie.’ and perhaps I will,” Peterson said. “It didn’t really bother me… [Chris Pine] is a very good looking man… I hope he gets my fashion style choice right.”

When asked about why he got emotional discussing Wilde’s comment, Peterson again fought back tears and said, “It’s really something to see — constantly how many people are dying for lack of an encouraging word and how easy it is to provide that if you’re careful.”

“Don’t Worry Darling” is now playing in theaters nationwide. Watch Peterson and Morgan’s full discussion below."
New Zealand plays 'Macarena' on repeat to flush out protesters,https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/new-zealand-plays-macarena-on-repeat-to-flush-out-protesters-1.5778945,nottheonion,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand -

Some countries might send in a riot squad to disperse trespassing protesters. In New Zealand, authorities turned on the sprinklers and Barry Manilow.

Initial moves to try and flush out several hundred protesters who have been camped on Parliament's grassy grounds since Tuesday had little effect.

The protesters, who have been voicing their opposition to coronavirus vaccine mandates, responded to the soaking from the sprinklers by digging trenches and installing makeshift drainpipes to divert the water.

When a downpour hit Saturday, their numbers only grew. Protesters brought in bales of straw, which they scattered on the increasingly sodden grounds at Parliament. Some shouted, others danced and one group performed a Maori haka.

By evening, Parliament Speaker Trevor Mallard had come up with a new plan to make the protesters uncomfortable: using a sound system to blast out vaccine messages, decades-old Barry Manilow songs and the 1990s earworm hit ""Macarena"" on a repeat loop.

Protesters responded by playing their own tunes, including Twister Sister's ""We're Not Gonna Take It.""

The protest began when a convoy of trucks and cars drove to Parliament from around the nation, inspired by protests in Canada. At first there were more than 1,000 protesters but that number dwindled as the week wore on before growing again on Saturday.

Police have been taking a more hands-off approach since Thursday, when they arrested 122 people and charged many of them with trespassing or obstruction. Police, who have been wearing protective vests but haven't been using riot gear or carrying guns, had tried to slowly advance on the protesters.

But that resulted in a number of physical confrontations. A video of two female officers briefly dragging a naked woman by her hair from amid a scuffle went viral.

In a response to questions from The Associated Press, New Zealand police said they did not remove the woman's clothing as some people had claimed online, and that she had been naked for ""some time"" before her arrest. Police also said the images and videos didn't provide the full context of the protest activity or the situation that police faced.

Still, the scuffles seemed to prompt a strategic rethink by police, who appeared more content to wait it out as the week wore on. But by Friday, Mallard, the Parliament speaker, had seen enough, and told staff to turn on the sprinklers overnight.

""I ordered them on,"" he confirmed to the AP.

""No one who is here is here legally, and if they're getting wet from below as well as above, they're likely to be a little bit less comfortable and more likely to go home,"" Mallard said, according to news organization Stuff.

""Some people have suggested we add the vaccine in the water, but I don't think it works that way,"" he joked.

Mallard told media he was responsible for the sound system loop as well.

Some of the protesters' vehicles have remained parked in the middle of streets around Parliament, forcing some street closures. The National Library and many cafes and bars in the area have closed their doors while the protest plays out. Police said one protester had a medical event on Friday evening and an ambulance was unable to reach him because of the vehicles blocking the streets, resulting in a delay before he was treated.

Among the protesters' grievances is the requirement in New Zealand that certain workers get vaccinated against COVID-19, including teachers, doctors, nurses, police and military personnel. Many protesters also oppose mask mandates -- such as those in stores and among children over about age 8 in classrooms -- and champion the ideal of more ""freedom.""

Parliament's grounds have often been the site of peaceful protests, although mass campouts are unusual. Typically at least some politicians will come out to listen to the concerns of protesters, but politicians reconvening at Parliament after a summer break were in rare unison by not acknowledging the protesters.

New Zealand was spared the worst of the pandemic after it closed its borders and implemented strict lockdowns, limiting the spread of the virus. The nation has reported just 53 virus deaths among its population of 5 million.

But some have grown weary of the restrictions. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern last week said the country would end its quarantine requirements for incoming travelers in stages as it reopened its borders. With about 77% of New Zealanders vaccinated, Ardern has also promised she won't impose more lockdowns.

An outbreak of the omicron variant has been growing, with New Zealand reporting a record 454 new community cases Saturday. But none of the 27 people hospitalized from the outbreak needed to be in intensive care beds."
Uvalde's school district police chief said he intentionally left his radios behind when responding to the mass shooting because he thought they would slow him down,https://www.insider.com/uvalde-schools-police-chief-said-he-intentionally-left-radios-behind-2022-6,nottheonion,"The Uvalde schools police chief said he left his radios behind during last month's mass shooting.

He said he believed that the radios would have slowed him down and impaired his shooting accuracy.

But he also said he was unaware students were calling 911 because he didn't have a radio on him.

Uvalde school district police chief Pete Arredondo, one of the first responders to last month's elementary school massacre, said he intentionally left his two radios behind when he ran into the building to try and stop the gunman, making it difficult for him to be in contact with most of the other officers on the scene throughout the entire situation.

In a phone interview with the Texas Tribune, Arredondo said he left two radios outside the school because he believed they would have slowed him down and that every second mattered.

One radio had a clip that may have fallen off his tactical belt, while another had an antenna that would have hit him as he ran, he told the Tribune.

However, the radios would have connected him to the campus and police networks, according to the outlet.

Arredondo said he also wanted both hands free to hold his gun so he could fire it more accurately.

Arredondo added that based on his prior experience, the radios didn't work well in some of the school buildings, and that he would have turned them off in the hallways to avoid being detected by the gunman.

Still, Arredondo's admission raises questions as to how the hour-long ordeal might have played out differently if he'd been able to receive real-time information via radio.

In a media conference after the shooting, the Texas Department of Public Safety Director, Steve McCraw, identified Arredondo as the incident commander and said the police chief had made the ""wrong decision"" to treat the gunman as a barricaded suspect instead of an active shooter.

But Arredondo told the Tribune that he had no idea at the time that he was the incident commander, although the outlet notes that according to the National Incident Management System, which ""guides all levels of government,"" he would have been the commander by definition as the first person on the scene.

He said he didn't give any orders, but used his phone to call for backup and an extraction tool for the locked door separating officers from the shooter and victims. Arredondo said he assumed that another officer or official had taken over as the coordinator for the situation's larger response.

Additionally, the police chief said he wasn't aware that children and teachers in the classroom were desperately calling 911 for help because he didn't have his radio with him.

Arredondo has received the bulk of national criticism for how long it took officers to deal with the gunman and has recently avoided the public eye. He's been accused of wasting time, failing to coordinate the responses of the dozens of on-scene officers from at least five agencies, and deciding to wait out a situation with an active shooter.

But he defended the police response as he spoke to the Tribune, saying that ""not a single responding officer ever hesitated, even for a moment, to put themselves at risk to save the children,"""
Coal industry ‘shocked and disheartened’ by Manchin climate deal,https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/3586854-coal-industry-shocked-and-disheartened-by-manchin-climate-deal/,nottheonion,"The West Virginia Coal Association and several other state-based coal industry groups on Wednesday blasted the tax and climate deal that Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) agreed to last week, warning it will “severely threaten American coal” and an estimated 381,000 jobs.

“This legislation is so egregious, it leaves those of us that call Sen. Manchin a friend, shocked and disheartened,” the groups wrote in a blistering statement that accused the West Virginia senator of zigzagging in the energy debate.

“Sen. Manchin has seemingly fought against numerous climate measures advanced over the past year by the national democratic establishment,” the groups said. “The current Schumer-Manchin draft agreement on climate and energy frankly leaves us questioning the motivation and sincerity of Manchin’s previous stance and his repeated chant: we must ‘innovate not eliminate.’”

The groups warn the deal Manchin crafted with Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) after months of negotiation “will quickly diminish our coal producing operations and all but obviate any need to innovate coal assets.”

The groups argue the bill — which Democrats have dubbed the Inflation Reduction Act and plan to pass this weekend — will do “nothing for coal or coal generation” and won’t reduce inflation or lower household energy costs.

“By turbocharging the lofty incentives that already extend to renewable energy, our nation’s baseload (reliable) coal electric generation assets will continue to be devalued and thrust into rapid decline,” the groups warned.

The statement was signed by Chris Hamilton, the president of the West Virginia Coal Association, as well as the leaders of the Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wyoming mining associations.

Manchin on Tuesday said he didn’t agree with predictions the bill will lead to coal plants closing in his state.

“I don’t think that’s the case at all,” he told reporters. “We have to have a vibrant fossil industry. We have a lot of coal plants that have been pretty old.”

“Coal is going to be needed for the base load that we’re going to have to have,” he said, arguing that coal will continue to generate enough electricity to meet minimum domestic demand.

Manchin also cited permitting reform, an initiative he is pushing in conjunction with the energy and climate provisions in the budget bill, as something that will also help fossil fuel producers."
"Thieves Steal Gallery Owner’s Multimillion-Dollar NFT Collection: ""All My Apes are Gone”",https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/todd-kramer-nft-theft-1234614874/,nottheonion,"“I have been hacked. All my apes gone. This just sold please help me,” wrote gallery owner Todd Kramer, of New York’s Ross + Kramer Gallery, in a since-deleted tweet posted on December 30.

A phishing scam had drained his Ethereum wallet of 15 NFTs valued at a total of $2.2 million, including four apes from the “Bored Ape Yacht Club” collection. The thief seemed to have sold off many of the pieces in Kramer’s collection, and Twitter users jeered at Kramer’s bad luck, pointing out that he had bet on an unregulated, decentralized system that would be unable to help him.

“Man If only there had been some kind of Regulating authority in place that could like Insure your investments against theft and fraud,” wrote one user with the handle @anarchy_shark.

But in the end, an authority did come through. With the help of the buyers and the NFT platform OpenSea, Kramer was able to get back several of his NFTs. Five hours after his original post, he wrote, in a tweet that has also since been deleted, “Update.. All Apes are frozen,,. Waiting for opensea team to get in,,,lessons learned. Use a hard wallet…”

OpenSea’s involvement sparked major controversy, with some alleging that NFTs could not truly be decentralized if it had “frozen” some, rendering them unsellable on the platform. Others pointed out that OpenSea had only frozen user’s ability to interact with the NFT through that one site alone—they could still be bought and sold elsewhere.

“We take theft seriously and have policies in place to meet our obligations to the community and deter theft in the wider ecosystem,” wrote an OpenSea representative in an email. “OpenSea is a blockchain explorer, meaning our goal is to provide the most comprehensive view into NFTs across different blockchains. We do not have the power to freeze or delist NFTs that exist on these blockchains, however we do disable the ability to use OpenSea to buy or sell stolen items. Since this issue emerged, we’ve built security tools and processes to combat theft on OpenSea. We are actively expanding our efforts across customer support, trust and safety, and site integrity so we can move faster to protect and empower our users.”

Kramer did not respond to requests for comment.

Phishing scams have become more frequent as NFTs have increased in value. However, most savvy users can protect themselves by using hard wallet, also known as a cold wallet, which is physical and only connects to the internet when plugged in and engaged. Kramer had been using a so-called hot wallet, which is continuously connected to the internet and thus more vulnerable.

More common than phishing scams, however, is theft of a different kind. Some people have begun making NFTs of art that they did not create, an issue for which no easy fix has yet been developed."
Ohio exempts clergy from reporting abuse,https://www.wtrf.com/ohio/ohio-exempts-clergy-from-reporting-abuse/,nottheonion,"Thirty-three states exempt clergy from laws requiring professionals such as teachers and doctors to report information about alleged child abuse to police or child welfare officials if the church deems the information privileged, an Associated Press review has found.

Close Thanks for signing up! Watch for us in your inbox.

This loophole has resulted in an unknown number of child sex abuse cases being allowed to continue for years despite the perpetrator having confessed the behavior to religious officials. In many of these cases, the privilege has been invoked to shield religious groups from civil and criminal liability after the abuse became known to civil authorities.

Over the past two decades lawmakers in these states have proposed more than 130 bills seeking to create or amend child sex abuse reporting laws, the AP review found. All either targeted the loophole and failed to close it, or amended the mandatory reporting statute without touching the clergy privilege amid intense opposition from religious groups.

Here is a look at the 33 states and the bills aimed at changing their laws, plus some tips for localizing the story.

___

ALABAMA

A 2003 Alabama state law included clergy in the list of mandatory reporters, but Alabama’s Rules of Evidence exempts information about alleged child abuse that is obtained by clergy in confidential communications.

ALASKA

In 2012, a bill targeting a different part of Alaska’s mandatory reporting statute expanded who would be a reporter, but did not target the privilege, which in Alaska is for all religious “practitioners.”

ARIZONA

Democratic state Sen. Victoria Steele has sought to close the clergy privilege loophole three times since 2020, and has been thwarted in committee each time.

ARKANSAS

Clergy are mandated reporters in Arkansas, but the clergy-penitent privilege applies to all confessional communications. The reporting laws were updated or amended multiple times in 2009 with the privilege untouched, and there has not been a move to close the loophole in the past decade.

CALIFORNIA

In 2019, then-California state Sen. Jerry Hill proposed a bill (SB-360) that would have required clergy to report reasonable suspicion of child abuse or neglect by other clergy members or coworkers that they learned of during confessions. The bill was placed on hold after opposition from the Catholic Church, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and other religious groups.

COLORADO

Colorado’s mandatory reporting statute has been amended 31 times since it passed in 1987, but the privilege was never specifically targeted. Colorado has a new task force investigating the clergy loophole that is due to report back in 2024.

DELAWARE

A privilege for communications “between priest and penitent in a sacramental confession” was added to Delaware’s Child Abuse Prevention Act of 1997. The bill passed unanimously. However, a judge suggested in a 2016 ruling that the clergy privilege would be unconstitutional if read narrowly to apply only to the religions that call clerics “priests” and recognize a sacrament called “confession.”

FLORIDA

The state’s Protection of Vulnerable Persons Act requires all adults to report cases of child harm, but allows churches to exempt clergy-penitent communications from the mandatory reporting statute.

GEORGIA

Georgia’s exemption for child abuse reports received during confessions was signed into law in 2012 as part of an unrelated criminal reform bill. The child abuse section significantly expanded mandated reporters of suspected abuse, adding clergy to the list for the first time but leaving in the privilege loophole.

IDAHO

Three bills have amended Idaho’s mandatory reporting rules over the past decade, yet none of them sought to eliminate the clergy-penitent privilege.

ILLINOIS

A 2019 domestic violence bill included language that would have deleted the clergy privilege in Illinois. After Catholics raised concerns, the lawmaker said she’d remove it. The bill never made it out of first stages.

KENTUCKY

An effort to remove Kentucky’s penitent privilege was attempted in 2003 when three lawmakers, all Democrats, proposed a bill amid a Catholic Church abuse scandal. The Archdiocese of Louisville was facing dozens of clergy abuse lawsuits, later settled in a class action lawsuit for about $25 million. The bill (HB58) never made it out of the Judiciary committee.

LOUISIANA

Clergy are mandated reporters, but the privilege loophole exists in Louisiana for confessional conversations. In 2016, the Louisiana Supreme Court ruled that a priest has no duty to report confidential information heard during a sacramental confession.

MAINE

Bills created clergy as mandated reporters but with the privilege intact, and expanded in 2003 the number of church workers and volunteers who fell under the mandatory reporting category.

MARYLAND

A 2003 Maryland bill would have closed the clergy reporting loophole, but a successful campaign to defeat the proposal was led by a Catholic cardinal who would later be defrocked for sexually abusing children and seminarians. A 2004 version would have required clergy to report while acting outside their clerical role. Both bills died in committee.

MASSACHUSETTS

In 2002, Massachusetts passed a mandatory reporting bill addressing clergy, but left in the privilege loophole. An AP review of bills since has found no effort to reverse the privilege.

MICHIGAN

Michigan passed a law in 2002 that added clergy as a mandated reporter, but included the loophole for confessions.

MINNESOTA

New mandatory reporting law enacted by Minnesota’s Legislature in 2020 did not include any suggestion of removing the clergy-penitent privilege.

MISSOURI

Both bills addressing the clergy-penitent privilege in Missouri were referred to committee and never received hearings. The sponsor told the AP she considered it a lost cause because of behind-the-scenes pushback from Catholic members.

MONTANA

A bill seeking to do away with Montana’s clergy-penitent privilege reporting exemption was put forward in 2021, but never got a hearing and died.

NEVADA

In 2005, clergy, practitioners of Christian Science, religious leaders and attorneys were removed as persons required to make reports of abuse, neglect, exploitation and isolation of people age 60 and older. A 2013 bill that failed would have added clergy back as required reporters of suspected instances of abuse.

NEW MEXICO

In 2003, New Mexico lawmakers added clergy to the list of reporters amid the Catholic Church’s scandals. The clergy privilege loophole was left in the law, and that piece was never debated. Since then, there have been several bills introduced aimed at clarifying the reporting law. Only one would have eliminated the clergy-penitent privilege. It died in committee.

NORTH DAKOTA

A bill seeking to remove the clergy-penitent privilege in North Dakota in 2021 was withdrawn under heavy pressure from Catholic dioceses.

OHIO

In recent years the Ohio Legislature has extended the statute of limitations for reporting abuse in response to the latest priest abuse scandals, but there have been no legislative efforts to remove the clergy-penitent privilege itself.

OREGON

Oregon’s statutes say public or private officials who are mandated to report include members of the clergy, except when such communication is privileged. There have been no relevant bills over the past decade that have challenged the privilege in Oregon.

PENNSYLVANIA

At least 40 bills were filed over 20 years in Pennsylvania with the mandatory reporting statute code. There were lots of chances to amend the law to remove the clergy privilege, but it never happened. In 2014, Pennsylvania updated its child abuse code and left in the privilege.

SOUTH CAROLINA

In the wake of the church scandals, a bill was introduced in 2003 that added clergy as mandated reporters unless the information is protected by the priest-penitent privilege. After that, various bills have amended child protection laws but left the privilege in.

UTAH

A bill seeking to close the clergy-penitent privilege written by Democratic Rep. Angela Romero in 2020 never made it out of committee after strong opposition from Catholic and Mormon churches. Romero is co-authoring a new clergy privilege bill in 2022.

VERMONT

Clergy were added to Vermont’s mandatory reporting law in 2003, but with the privilege loophole.

VIRGINIA

A bill in 2019 added priests to Virginia’s list of mandatory reporters. The bill’s sponsor said that not targeting the privilege was intentional so that the legislation would make it through without the church killing it.

WASHINGTON

Washington doesn’t list clergy as mandated reporters but grants clergy-penitent privilege, though it’s limited to pastoral communications. There have been numerous tries to add clergy as mandated reporters, and they’ve all failed.

WISCONSIN

Two bills sought to remove the clergy-penitent privilege from state law in Wisconsin in 2019 and 2022 made little progress amid strong public opposition from the Catholic Church.

WYOMING

Wyoming law cites “any person” as a mandated reporter of abuse, which can include clergy. However, there is a clergy privilege in Wyoming that exempts clergy from having to report. A failed bill in 2013 that sought to increase penalties for failing to report did not address the privilege."
Republican senator says tax rises in own plan are ‘Democratic talking points’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/28/rick-scott-republican-senator-tax-rises-plan,nottheonion,"A Republican senator and reputed presidential hopeful found himself in a tough spot when he claimed tax rises contained in his own “11 point plan to rescue America” were “Democratic talking points” instead.

“No, no, it’s in the plan!” his interviewer exclaimed, on Fox News Sunday. “It’s in the plan!”

Rick Scott, from Florida, is a former healthcare chief executive whose company admitted 14 felonies related to fraudulent practices. As the South Florida Sun-Sentinel put it, “most happened under Scott’s leadership”.

As the Guardian reported, when Scott was governor of Florida “his administration presided over the effective blocking of $70m in federal funds available for fighting the state’s HIV crisis”.

Scott beat an incumbent Democrat for a Senate seat in 2018 and is now chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) as the party eyes a Senate takeover in the midterm elections.

Last month, Scott released an “11 Point Plan to Rescue America”. It proposes that more Americans pay federal income tax and says Congress could “sunset” social security and Medicare within five years, meaning allow them to lapse.

The plan immediately came under fire.

The non-partisan Institution on Taxation and Economic Policy (Itep) said Scott’s plan “would increase taxes by more than $1,000 on average for the poorest 40% of Americans”.

Itep also noted the effect Scott’s plan would have on Republican heartlands, saying the states most affected, “where more than 40% of residents would face tax increases, are … Mississippi, West Virginia, Arkansas, Louisiana, Alabama, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Georgia, New Mexico, South Carolina and … Florida”.

Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, disowned the plan, saying: “We will not have as part of our agenda a bill that raises taxes on half the American people and sunsets social security and Medicare within five years.”

Dana Milbank, a Washington Post columnist, said Scott had given Democrats a much-needed election-year gift.

“All Democrats need do,” he wrote, regarding a plan which would also cut trade with China and slash tax-gathering resources, “is repeat Scott’s own words.”

The Fox News Sunday host John Roberts asked Scott: “Why would you propose something like that in an election year?”

Scott said Roberts was repeating “Democrat talking points”.

“No, no, it’s in the plan!” Roberts said. “It’s in the plan!”

Scott said: “But here’s the thing about reality for a second.”

Roberts said: “But, Senator, hang on. It’s not a Democratic talking point! It’s in the plan!”

Scott defended his plan, saying, “We ought to every year talk about exactly how we are going to fix Medicare and social security” but “no one that I know of wants to sunset” either.

“Here’s what’s unfair,” he added, of his tax plan. “We have people that … could go to work and have figured out how to have government pay their way. That’s not right. They ought to have some skin in the game. I don’t care if it’s a dollar. We ought to all be in this together.”

Scott is reportedly Donald Trump’s choice to replace McConnell as Senate leader – an effort that shows no sign of succeeding.

Scott was asked if, with a Wall Street Journal column entitled “Why I’m Defying Beltway Cowardice”, he was calling McConnell a coward. He dodged the question, saying he wanted “to get something done”.

Complaining about “the woke left” and Democratic policy on immigration and energy, he said: “We’ve got to change this. You don’t change it without having a plan.”"

"Marketed as 'Italy's No. 1 brand of pasta,' Barilla sued over product not being made in Italy",https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2022/10/19/barilla-lawsuit-pasta-not-made-italy/10544234002/,nottheonion,"Advertised as ""Italy's No. 1 brand of pasta,"" the popular brand Barilla will face a lawsuit over accusations it misled consumers to believe products made in Iowa and New York were actually made in Italy.

A federal judge on Monday denied Barilla’s motion to dismiss a class-action lawsuit accusing the company of misrepresenting its products. Judge Donna Ryu found that the company’s phrase, ""Italy's No.1 brand of pasta,” could mislead consumers to believe that the pasta is made in Italy. Barilla also features the green, red and white colors of the Italian flag on the signature blue boxes.

In addition to asking the court to stop Barilla from using Italy’s likeness in marketing and on the product, plaintiffs are seeking monetary compensation, claiming they overpaid for pasta.

Barilla originated as a bread and pasta shop in Italy but is now based in Illinois. Barilla argues that its trademark is used to “invoke the company’s Italian roots through generalized representations of the brand as a whole,” not mislead buyers.

The judge's decision comes on the heels of a similar complaint filed against the makers of Texas Pete hot sauce after a California man learned the product isn't actually made in Texas.

What does the lawsuit claim?

In the original complaint, Matthew Sinatro and Jessica Prost said that because of how the company’s products are advertised, they purchased multiple boxes of Barilla spaghetti and angel hair pasta with the belief the pasta was made in Italy with Italian ingredients.

The complaint says Barilla doesn’t exclusively use Italian wheat in its products and exploits consumers who are willing to pay more for authentic Italian pasta. The company is accused of using deceptive advertising and marketing to charge more and increase profits.

Floating abortion clinic proposed in Gulf to bypass bans,https://apnews.com/article/abortion-health-reproductive-rights-government-and-politics-bfab2bd6604229d7b2bcad630037c4e8,nottheonion,"MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — A California doctor is proposing a floating abortion clinic in the Gulf of Mexico as a way to maintain access for people in southern states where abortion bans have been enacted.

The idea is to provide a clinic aboard a ship in federal waters, and out of reach of state laws, that would offer first trimester surgical abortions, contraception and other care, said Dr. Meg Autry, an obstetrician and gynecologist and a professor at the University of California San Francisco.

“There’s been an assault on reproductive rights in our country and I’m a lifelong advocate for reproductive health and choice. We have to create options and be thoughtful and creative to help people in restrictive states get the health care they deserve,” she told The Associated Press.

Autry said the idea is only in the fundraising stage through the non-profit, “PRROWESS” — short for “Protecting Reproductive Rights Of Women Endangered by State Statutes.”

The proposal comes as abortion access in the southern United States has been swiftly curtailed after the U.S. Supreme Court turned the issue of abortion back to the states.

Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas have had abortion bans take effect. A Florida law, which is in effect after a legal back-and-forth, prohibits abortions after 15 weeks, with exceptions if the procedure is necessary to save a life, prevent serious injury or if the fetus has a fatal abnormality.

Autry said their legal team believes there is a swath of federal water where licensed providers could safely and legally provide abortions out of reach of state laws. For women in southern states with abortion bans, going to the coast and boarding a boat may be closer and easier than trying to travel to a state where abortion remains legal, she said.

“This is closer and faster access for some people, particularly for working people that live in the southernmost part of these states,” she said.

Autry said they are still trying to work out many of the details such as where the boat will launch and how women would get to the ship."

Gardaí remove the body of a man left at a post office on Staplestown Road in Carlow. Picture: Dylan Vaughan.

A dead man was brought to a post office this morning in an attempt to collect his pension in one of the most bizarre incidents that gardaí have ever seen.

The shocking incident in which the deceased male was propped up by two other men happened at the post office on Staplestown Road in Carlow town.

Staff at the post office immediately became suspicious and contacted emergency services and gardaí rushed to the scene.

No money was handed over and it is understood that the deceased man is well known to the two men who moved his body.

A local woman living beside the post office told how her daughter witnessed two men carrying a man into the shop.

“She was leaving my house at the time and said the man looked unwell as his feet were dragging the ground,” she said.

The woman, who did not want to be named, said there was a queue outside of the post office at the time.

“It’s a small shop and you’re only allowed three at a time with social distancing. People were in shock as they thought he was after having a heart attack,” she said.

“I feel awful for the staff. They’ve suffered so many robberies over the years, they’re worn out. I’ve a 12 year old daughter and I’m trying to explain to her what happened and sure where do you start. It’s awful.”

Neighbours of the deceased said they are in “total shock” after the incident.

“He was a lovely man, a lovely neighbour and we’re all very upset,” one woman said.

“We don’t want to speculate about what happened but all I can say is it’s a sad night and a shock to the system,” another said.

Gardaí confirmed they were investigating.

“Gardaí are investigating all the circumstances surrounding the unexplained death of an elderly male in the Carlow area this morning, Friday 21st January 2022,” a spokesman said.

“The services of the Garda Technical Bureau and the Office of the State Pathologist have been requested.

“A post mortem will be conducted by the Office of the State Pathologist, the results of which will determine the course of the investigation.”

Mayor of Carlow, Fianna Fáil Councillor Ken Murnane, expressed shock at the news.

“I heard there was a commotion in the post office,” he said this evening.

""I go by there all the time and it’s a very busy post office – normally there’d be a queue out the door there.

""I was absolutely shocked to hear about what happened.

""I cannot believe anyone would do something like that. It beggars belief, I’m just shocked.”

Local Fine Gael councillor Fergal Byrne said “The whole town is in shock.

“The man who passed away was a nice man by all accounts and someone who caused no offence to anyone.

“The staff in the shop are very shook up from it. I’d like to offer my sympathies to the man’s family also. It’s a bizarre and upsetting situation.”

Independent councillor John Cassin said the bizarre news has left the local community stunned.

“People are just shocked,” he said. “I don’t even know what to say.”"
"New York City mayor can hire brother, but only for $1, ethics board says",https://www.amny.com/politics/new-york-city-mayor-can-hire-brother-but-only-for-1-ethics-board-says/,nottheonion,"Sign up for our amNY Sports email newsletter to get insights and game coverage for your favorite teams

A New York City ethics panel has agreed that Mayor Eric Adams can hire his brother as a senior security adviser, but only at $1 per year and with no power over department personnel to avoid the appearance of favoritism.

The decision by the New York City Conflicts of Interest Board, made public on Thursday, seeks to put an end to an uproar that erupted in America’s largest city after Adams initially sought to hire his younger brother Bernard as a deputy police commissioner for a yearly salary of $240,000.

The mayor’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.

The panel said that while a city charter prohibits public servants from seeking advantages for members of their family, it would grant Adams a waiver to hire his brother because the job of “senior security adviser” would be essentially unpaid and carry no authority within the New York City Police Department.

A similar waiver was granted to Adams’ predecessor, Bill de Blasio, who appointed his wife to head the board of directors for a not-for-profit philanthropic organization.

Adams, a 61-year-old former New York City police officer who took office on Jan. 1, faced accusations of nepotism after announcing the appointment of his brother to a high-paid job in his administration.

The mayor first responded by reassigning Bernard Adams, 51, to be security adviser, earning $210,000 yearly and said he would seek guidance from the ethics board.

Adams, a Democrat, was elected in November after pledging to tackle violent crime."

"Buyer of ""Pepe the Frog"" NFT files US$500,000 lawsuit after creator releases identical NFTs for free",https://www.notebookcheck.net/Buyer-of-Pepe-the-Frog-NFT-files-US-500-000-lawsuit-after-creator-releases-identical-NFTs-for-free.608817.0.html,nottheonion,"After the ""Pepe the Frog"" creator released 46 identical NFTs, an apparent case of buyer's remorse has now led to a US$500,000 lawsuit in which the winner of the original NFT auction accuses the creator and his organization of fraudulent inducement and unlawful business acts.

4 Reviews

NFTs, short for non-fungible tokens, are certainly one of the more peculiar digital trends that are based on the blockchain technology which also gave rise to cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. However, the tangible value of NFTs remains highly disputable, which is now highlighted by a new lawsuit filed in the US.

According to a report by Kotaku, Halston Thayer won a US$537,084 auction for an NFT showing the controversial meme figure ""Pepe the Frog"", which has mostly been associated with memes from the alt-right movement in the United States. The NFT auction in question took place last October and was conducted by the frog's creator Matt Furie and his organization called PegzDAO.

In the auction, the organization apparently disclosed the existence of 99 additional NFTs with the identical ""Pepe the Frog"" image, but allegedly insisted that those would remain in possession of PegzDAO. Therefore, the affluent buyer paid over half a million dollars in crypto assuming that he would receive a unique NFT in return. But as it turned out, the organization ultimately released 46 identical and completely free NFTs only a few weeks later.

Thayer has now filed a lawsuit and claims that the value of his NFT dropped significantly due to the release of the aforementioned free additional ""Pepe the Frog"" NFTs, while he also accuses the creator and his organization of unlawful business practices. However, it has to be noted that buyers do not acquire the legal copyright of their NFT's image. In the end, this bizarre incident and legal conflict once again underlines the intangible value and sometimes inexplicable price of non-fungible tokens which can either be worth a fortune, or barely anything if they are not unique.

Armed PA man in wig trying to ‘restore Trump as President’ arrested at Dairy Queen,https://www.wearecentralpa.com/news/regional-news/armed-pa-man-in-wig-trying-to-restore-trump-as-president-arrested-at-dairy-queen/?10974,nottheonion,"WESTMORELAND COUNTY, Pa. (WTAJ) — An armed Pennsylvania man in a rainbow wig who was trying to ‘restore Trump as President’ was arrested at a Dairy Queen, Delmont Borough police report.

The wigged man who reportedly told police he “talks to God” is 61-year-old Jan Stawovy, of Hunker Pa. Police were called Saturday afternoon, Sept. 10, due to Stawovy driving erratically.

While looking for his Jeep, police said they were informed he pulled into a Dairy Queen on Greensburg Street and he was inside wearing a bright yellow vest, a rainbow wig, and carrying a handgun.

After arriving, police made contact with Stawovy. According to the affidavit, Stawovy first claimed he was working “undercover with Pennsylvania State Police working on a major drug sting.” While talking to him, police said Stawovy continued to shout and yell profanities.

Police said that Stawovy claimed he “talked to God” and was a “prophet” and would “kill all the Democrats because Trump was still president.”

He said he was working to “restore Trump to President of the United States,” according to court papers.

Stawovy reportedly claimed he knew the Dairy Queen workers and they would “vouch” for him. The manager told police that he was in the store earlier that same day and just put $120 on the counter and said it was a tip for “non-Democrats,” but other than that, they don’t know who he is.

Stawovy was taken into custody without further incident.

A search of his car turned up two more loaded handguns, a 9mm and .22 caliber along with 62 rounds of ammunition. Police noted that Stawovy didn’t have a concealed carry permit.

The man is facing multiple felony charges."
Soldier seeking support for PTSD 'disgusted' after he was casually offered euthanasia by Veterans Affairs employee,https://meaww.com/canadian-va-veteran-medical-assistance-in-dying-maid-euthanasia-vac-employee-ptsd,nottheonion,"CANADA: A Veterans Affairs Canada employee has provided medical aid in dying advice to a Canadian Forces veteran who suffered from traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Last week, VAC acknowledged in a statement that medical aid-in-dying was improperly provided to the veteran in one case. According to a Global News report, after the former soldier expressed displeasure with the notion of medical aid in dying, the agency promised that the necessary administrative steps would be taken to rectify the incident.

The former soldier reportedly called VAC for PTSD treatment when the employee brought up the subject of medical euthanasia, without being asked. The idea reportedly startled the former soldier. According to his family, who spoke with Global News, the veteran had been making progress in his mental and physical recovery and felt abandoned by the organization responsible for assisting veterans.

Sources close to the veteran said he and his family were ""disgusted"" by the conversation and felt betrayed by the agency mandated to assist veterans. The sources said the veteran was seeking services to recover from injuries suffered in the line of duty and had been experiencing positive improvements in his mental and physical health. They say the unprompted offer of MAID disrupted his progress and has been harmful to the veteran’s progress and his family’s wellbeing.

ADVERTISEMENT

Since the ex-soldier's encounter with the employee, there have been concerns that the conversation may not have been an isolated incident. This has led to inquiries about how often the organization has provided or mentioned MAID to people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. After being criticized several times for the incident, the organization called the ex-military man to apologize. The organization stated that it sincerely regretted everything that happened.

Canada approved MAID in 2016, and some changes were made to the law in 2021 to clarify which people are eligible for treatment. Starting in 2023, people struggling with mental health issues and distress will also be able to use MAID. However, VAC, an organization responsible for assisting a group of people potentially at increased risk for suicide, is not authorized to discuss MAID with veterans. ""Medical assistance in dying counseling is not a service provided by VAC "" states VAC.

For military members and former soldiers, the Canadian government introduced a new suicide prevention policy in 2017. The prevention policy provided more treatment options and resources. Policymakers identified several strategies, including training health care workers on how to respond to suicide risk signals."

Construction jobs gap worsened by ‘reluctance to get out of bed for 7am’,https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/construction-jobs-gap-worsened-by-reluctance-to-get-out-of-bed-for-7am-1.4883030,nottheonion,"Carpentry apprentices with Dublin City Council, Katherine Hannon, Jordan Kelly and Charlotte O’Reilly with Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys at Tallaght Stadium for the launch of construction work and skills week. Photograph: Maxwells

A shortage of apprentices in the construction sector is in part due to a reluctance among younger people to “get out of bed for seven o’clock in the morning”, a manager in the engineering sector has said.

Conor Gray, apprentice development manager at engineering contractor Mercury, said people were not applying to become electricians, plumbers and pipefitters at a time when they are sorely needed.

“The hours that we work, a lot of our projects will start at seven in the morning. I’d be perfectly honest, there’s an awful lot of young people that don’t like getting out of the bed for seven o’clock in the morning and that’s just a fact,” he told The Irish Times. “About a month ago we put out an advertisement across all the social media platforms and everywhere else looking for 35 people and we got about two applications.”

Mr Gray was speaking at an apprenticeship expo held in Tallaght stadium, west Dublin to mark the start of Construction Work and Skills week.

There was a skills shortage across the construction industry but particularly facing homebuilders, he said. “There’s an awful lot of traffic coming down from Northern Ireland, tradespeople coming down from the North that are probably back filling the shortage that we have down here,” he said.

Tom Parlon, head of the Construction Industry Federation, said he would be “slow to tar young people as lazy or unmotivated” and added other sectors such as hospitality were facing big challenges finding workers.

The construction sector had to find a way to make younger generations see the appeal of a career in the sector, he said. “It’s not all mud and boots, it’s increasingly more high-tech now.”

Padraig Gavigan, contracts director for construction company JJ Rhatigan, said addressing the skills shortage was ""one cog in the wheel"" to solve the housing crisis.

“There’s a general skills shortage across the whole industry at all levels, from traders through to engineers, management, it’s widespread,” he said.

The last 10 years had seen young people opting to go to college rather than pursuing apprenticeships, which had left a “gap in the market,” he said.

Gary Mallon of Newry-based bricklayers Malmac Construction said the shortage of workers had started to have a major impact in the last two years.

A lack of tradespeople was “for sure” holding up projects and smaller construction companies in particular were “really struggling to get manpower,” he said.

The option of learning a trade did not seem to be on most young people’s radar, he said. “When I was in the training centre or looking (for) a trade, you’d an uncle or somebody in it and there just doesn’t seem to be those people in their ears trying to tell them to get into it anymore,” he said.

Katherine Hannon, an apprentice carpenter working for Dublin City Council, is one woman bucking that trend. After studying Maths and working in a bank at 35 she decided to change career and became an apprentice with the local authority. She had been apprehensive about joining a heavily male dominated field but said she found ""nobody treats you any different"".

Initially the only female apprentice with the council she is now one of five. “When we’re out at a job and we’re out fitting a window, someone will shout up at us ‘Oh, you’re a woman doing that’ and we’d be like: Yeah we’re allowed work now,” she said."
"Detroit fan ‘fuming’ after accidentally buying tickets for Red Hot Chili Peppers cover band, Red NOT Chili Peppers",https://www.metrotimes.com/music/detroit-fan-fuming-after-accidentally-buying-tickets-for-red-hot-chili-peppers-cover-band-red-not-chili-peppers-29807441,nottheonion,"click to enlarge Courtesy photo The Red NOT Chili Peppers, NOT the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

While scrolling on social media, Aaron saw an ad for what appeared to be a gig for one of his favorite bands, the Red Hot Chili Peppers. He couldn’t believe his luck. The band was performing on Thursday, April 28 at Ferndale’s small Magic Bag venue, and tickets were under $20.

It wasn’t completely far-fetched. The longstanding Los Angeles-based rock band recently dropped its 12th studio album, Unlimited Love, and has been promoting it with surprise shows in L.A. at smaller venues like the Fonda Theatre and Amoeba Music. Plus, the band has Michigan connections — frontman Anthony Kiedis is from Grand Rapids and drummer Chad Smith grew up in Bloomfield Hills.

“The way they were promoting the record that just came out, they were doing smaller venues out west, doing little record stores, free shows, things like that,” says Aaron, who asked that we use his first name only. “I was like, oh my god, maybe I’m lucky.” He immediately bought four tickets.

But it wasn’t until he received a confirmation email that he realized he made an error. The band was actually Red NOT Chili Peppers, a Red Hot Chili Peppers cover band.

“It’s like the same spelling, just one letter,” says Aaron, who added that he didn’t notice it in the ad’s graphic, where the band name was rendered in all caps.

According to the band’s website, the Red NOT Chili Peppers “pay tribute to the ultimate funk rock quartet — a band who has transcended three decades of chart-topping success as well as developed one of the largest die-hard fanbases in the world.”

While the Red Hot Chili Peppers are coming through Detroit on the Unlimited Love tour, they’re performing on Sunday, Aug. 14 at the much, much, much larger Comerica Park stadium, along with the Strokes and Thundercat. Tickets are still available and range from $95 to $136.

The Magic Bag has kind of a reputation for booking cover bands — Detroit-based acts including a Smiths tribute called the Smiths United and a Cure tribute called Re-Cure frequently perform there, as does the excellently named all-women New York-based Led Zeppelin cover band Lez Zeppelin.

Still, Aaron, who clarifies that he was “completely sober when I bought these tickets,” says, “It’s kind of like slick advertising, basically.”

He adds, “I’m fuming.”

He says he immediately reached out to ticket vendor Ticketweb and asked for a refund. Two days later he got a response from an employee who said they could not offer one. When Aaron asked to speak to a manager, they said due to the company’s policy, they could not offer a refund.

A rep from the Magic Bag could not be reached for comment.

“I’m just gonna let it go, man,” says Aaron, who came to us with the story as a tip. “I’m not tripping about it.”

He says that since he’s such a big fan, he might go see the cover band anyway.

“I mean, I’d probably go,” he says. “Sure.”

Lakota school board member accidentally posts ‘porn’ link while advocating for abstinence,https://www.fox19.com/2022/04/28/lakota-school-board-member-accidentally-posts-porn-link-while-advocating-abstinence/,nottheonion,"BUTLER COUNTY, Ohio (WXIX) - The Lakota School Board on Wednesday voted 4-1 to censure a board member for posting on Facebook a link that led to “inappropriate sexual content.”

A separate motion passed requesting that the board member, Darbi Boddy, resign immediately.

Boddy, according to the censure resolution, made the post on her campaign’s Facebook account.

In her post, Boddy responds to the notion of the district hiring a firm to review its curriculum for potentially objectionable content.

Boddy, who ran on a platform opposing critical race theory, objects to hiring the firm without the board ensuring that both board members and the firm have an understanding of what CRT actually is. But she also objects to sexual education content which she claims is already found in Ohio schools, and she posts links to such sites as examples of what she would find objectionable, including content ”about masturbating, sex toys, anything taught besides abstinence.”

One of the links originally contained a typo that took users not to the intended site but to a site containing sexual content the board found inappropriate.

“To post pornographic content on an official, public-facing school board member account that can be accessed by many of our own students is absolutely unacceptable,” Board President Lynda O’Connor said Wednesday evening. “Furthermore, to make a public accusation that our curriculum contains such pornographic material is deplorable.”

Story continues below

Boddy has since removed the link, according to the school board.

She posted a follow-up statement prior to Wednesday’s meeting. It reads in part: “One of the pornographic sites that was put in my communication as part of my list of what to look for in our schools, was a typo and although it was not meant to be part of my communication, it is still representative of the disgusting material that is being put in front of our children. If a typo brings more attention to this problem so be it.”

The board’s censure resolution contends it doesn’t matter that Boddy might not have meant to post the link in question: “Even if the link was posted inadvertently, Ms. Boddy demonstrated gross negligence and reckless conduct by posting links on her Facebook page without ensuring that the content thereon is appropriate.”

Boddy cast the lone no vote on the censure resolution as she walked out of the meeting, saying, “I will not be part of this political ruse.”

The board then voted 4-0 on the resignation request.

“You exposed our community, including potentially children, to inappropriate sexual content,” O’Connor said. “By trying to raise awareness about what to keep out of our schools, your manner of communication has placed it directly into our school community. Your conduct was fundamentally wrong and we expect you to take responsibility.”

School boards in Ohio do not have the authority to remove one of their fellow board members from the board.

“The steps taken at this afternoon’s emergency meeting are the strongest actions the Board can legally take in response to this situation,” a district spokesperson said.

The censure resolution notes Boddy has engaged in previous conduct unbecoming of a board member, referencing “disrespectful and unprofessional comments” to administrators and other Board members.

An earlier online petition to censure Boddy “for her continued disrespect and aggression” towards district superintendent Matt Miller has more than 1,500 signatures, according to the Enquirer.

The petition reads, “Month after month, meeting after meeting, Mrs. Boddy has repeatedly attacked the integrity and honesty of Mr. Miller. Mrs. Boddy’s statements and behavior serve to undermine the confidence in District leadership at the Board level. Additionally, by her words and statements she is demeaning the integrity of the entire Lakota Staff.”

Clarence Thomas: supreme court could be ‘compromised’ by politics,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/12/clarence-thomas-supreme-court-conservative-politics,nottheonion,"The US supreme court could “at some point” become “compromised” by politics, said Clarence Thomas – one of six conservatives on the nine-member court after Republicans denied Barack Obama a nomination then rammed three new justices through during the hard-right presidency of Donald Trump.

“You can cavalierly talk about packing or stacking the court,” said Thomas, whose wife, Ginni Thomas, has come under extensive scrutiny for work for rightwing groups including supporting Trump’s attempts to overturn an election.

“You can cavalierly talk about doing this or doing that. At some point the institution is going to be compromised.”

Thomas was speaking at a hotel in Salt Lake City on Friday.

“By doing this,” he said, “you continue to chip away at the respect of the institutions that the next generation is going to need if they’re going to have civil society.”

The court is set to rule this year on divisive issues including abortion, gun control, the climate crisis and voting rights. Conservative victories are expected. The conservative-dominated court has already ruled against the Biden administration on coronavirus mitigation and other matters.

The US constitution does not mandate that the court consist of nine justices. Some progressives and Democratic politicians have therefore called to expand it, in order to reset its ideological balance. Democrats in Congress last year introduced a bill to add four justices and Joe Biden has created a commission to study expansion.

Few analysts think expansion is likely to happen.

Republican senators are currently attacking Biden for his campaign promise to nominate a first Black woman to the court, a promise he fulfilled by nominating Ketanji Brown Jackson to replace the retiring Stephen Breyer.

Republican presidents have nominated justices on grounds of identity, most recently when Trump said he would pick a woman to replace Ruth Bader Ginsberg, the liberal lion who died in September 2020.

Ignoring their own claims about the impropriety of confirmations in election years, made in denying Merrick Garland even a hearing to replace Antonin Scalia in 2016, Senate Republicans installed Amy Coney Barrett, a hardline Catholic conservative, as Ginsberg’s replacement.

In Utah on Friday, Thomas also voiced a familiar conservative complaint about so-called “cancel culture”, the supposed silencing of voices or world views deemed unacceptable on political grounds.

He was, he said, “afraid, particularly in this world of cancel culture attack, I don’t know where you’re going to learn to engage as we did when I grew up.

“If you don’t learn at that level in high school, in grammar school, in your neighborhood, or in civic organizations, then how do you have it when you’re making decisions in government, in the legislature, or in the courts?”

Thomas also attacked the media for, he said, cultivating inaccurate impressions about public figures including himself, his wife and Scalia.

Ginni Thomas has faced scrutiny for her involvement in groups that file briefs about cases in front of the supreme court, as well as using Facebook to amplify partisan attacks.

Thomas has claimed the supreme court is above politics – a claim made by justices on either side of the partisan divide.

Congress is preparing for confirmation hearings for Jackson. She will be installed if all 50 Democratic senators back her, via the casting vote of the vice-president, Kamala Harris. Some Republicans have indicated they could support her too.

In Utah, Thomas recalled his own confirmation in 1991 as a humiliating and embarrassing experience. Lawmakers including Biden grilled Thomas about sexual harassment allegations from Anita Hill, a former employee, leading him to call the experience a “high tech lynching”. Biden has also been criticised for his treatment of Hill.

On Friday, Thomas said he held civility as one of his highest values. He said he learned to respect institutions and debate civilly with those who disagreed with him during his years in school.

Based on conversations with students in recent years, he said, he does not believe colleges are now welcoming places for productive debate, particularly for students who support what he described as traditional families or oppose abortion.

Thomas did not reference the future of Roe v Wade, the 1973 decision that guaranteed abortion rights. The court on which he sits is scheduled to rule this year on Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization, concerning whether Mississippi can ban abortions at 15 weeks.

The court is expected to overturn Roe. While the justices deliberate, conservative lawmakers in Florida, West Virginia and Kentucky are advancing similar legislation."

California court rules that bees are a type of fish in order to protect them under the state's endangered species act,http://insider.com/bees-officially-type-of-fish-california-judges-ruling-endangered-species-2022-6,nottheonion,"Judges ruled Tuesday that bumble bees could be classed as fish under California environmental laws.

This unlocks protections for the state's four endangered bumble-bee species.

The ruling clarifies the state's confusing classification in its environmental protections.

A trio of judges in California said on Tuesday that bees could be legally classified as a type of fish as part of a ruling that gave added conservation protections to the endangered species.

""The issue presented here is whether the bumble bee, a terrestrial invertebrate, falls within the definition of fish,"" the judges wrote in their ruling. And, they concluded, it does.

Formerly, the problem for bee lovers — and lovers of all Californian terrestrial invertebrates — was down to the way protected animals had been classified in the state's laws.

While four bee species were classified as endangered in 2018, land invertebrates are not explicitly protected under the California Endangered Species Act, which protects endangered ""native species or subspecies of a bird, mammal, fish, amphibian, reptile, or plant.""

But the law's fish and game code, which establishes the basis on which plants and animals are protected, defines ""fish"" as ""a wild fish, mollusk, crustacean, invertebrate, amphibian, or part, spawn, or ovum of any of those animals.""

Given that many of the above marine creatures aren't even fish, California has been arguing ever since about whether ""invertebrates"" here should apply to bees.

The appeal overturns a ruling from November 2020 that was backed by major agricultural groups, Law & Crime reported. There, the judge ruled that ""invertebrates"" in the fish and game code's ""fish"" definition applied only to marine invertebrates, like anemones or sea urchins.

But on Tuesday's appeal, the judges ruled they were obliged to ""liberally"" interpret the Endangered Species Act's terms to make sure it could be effective.

""Although the term fish is colloquially and commonly understood to refer to aquatic species,"" the judges said, legislative jargon in this case could be justified in expanding the definition to include bees.

The judges added that frogs were also protected under the ""fish"" section because of its inclusion of amphibians.

They also said land-based invertebrates had been protected under the category of ""fish"" under the statute in the past, such as in 1980, when the Trinity bristle snail was protected.

The judges described how California's Legislature had wavered for years over whether to explicitly include invertebrates in the act, presumably saving them the trouble of having to expand the definition of fish.

In one instance in 1985, the judges said, lawmakers reasoned it was unnecessary because ""invertebrates were already included in the definition of fish.""

""'Adding the term invertebrates in the legislation would only serve to confuse the matter,'"" they cited lawmakers as saying.

""It is a great day for California's bumble bees,"" Pamela Flick, the California program director at Defenders of Wildlife, one of the groups that brought the appeal, said in a press statement following the ruling."

Edie Falco Shot ‘Avatar 2’ So Long Ago She Thought It Already Got Released and Flopped: ‘It Hasn’t Come Out Yet?’,https://variety.com/2022/film/news/edie-falco-shot-avatar-2-four-years-before-release-1235465720/,nottheonion,"One of the more delightful surprises in “Avatar: The Way of Water” is when Edie Falco pops up as General Frances Ardmore, a new military commander on Pandora. Ardmore is on a mission to make Pandora hospitable for the human race, as Earth is dying and the human population will soon need a new permanent home. Falco was not prominently featured in any marketing materials, so you’d be forgiven for not knowing the four-time Emmy winner plays a crucial supporting role in the “Avatar” franchise. Falco herself didn’t even know the movie’s release plans.

During a recent interview on ABC’s “The View,” Falco revealed she shot her scenes in “Avatar: The Way of Water” over four years ago. So much time went by in between filming and the 2022 release date that Falco had simply assumed the movie opened in theaters already and just didn’t perform too well.

“I saw the first one when it was out,” Falco said. “The second ‘Avatar’ I shot four years ago. I’ve been busy and doing stuff. Somebody mentioned ‘Avatar’ and I thought, ‘Oh, I guess it came out and it didn’t do very well because I didn’t hear anything about it.’ It happens! Someone recently said, ‘”Avatar” is coming out,’ and I said, ‘Oh, it hasn’t come out yet?’ I will never work again because I said that.”

Falco has yet to see “Avatar: The Way of Water.” Her character is one of the few human characters in the sequel, to which Falco responded, “I wanted to be blue! I was excited I’d be blue and very tall. I didn’t get either of those things.”

Although Falco’s role as General Ardmore is somewhat brief in “Avatar: The Way of Water,” the pathway is set for the character to potentially become a main antagonist in the franchise.

“Avatar: The Way of Water” is now playing in theaters nationwide."

Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, compared himself to George Floyd while apologizing to the Black community for his previous controversial comments.

While speaking to paparazzi on Friday, Ye apologized for falsely claiming that Floyd, who was killed after the former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin leaned a knee on his neck for nine minutes and 29 seconds, died of a fentanyl drug overdose.

""It hurt the Black people,"" he said. ""So I want to apologize for hurting them because right now God has shown me by what Adidas is doing, and by what the media is doing, I know how it feels to have a knee on my neck now.""

Lawyers representing George Floyd's family previously said the family had been getting online hate after the rapper made comments about his death.

Adidas, along with several other companies, recently cut ties with the rapper, citing his ""hateful and dangerous"" comments which included antisemitism.

Ye said he had been ""humbled"" by the situation, which he previously said led to him losing $2 billion in one day.

Ye also appeared to walk back on some of his previous comments disparaging the Black Lives Matter movement.

He told the paparazzi that while there were elements of the Black Lives Matter movement he did not agree with, he recognized that the movement initially ""made us feel good together as a people.""

The rapper has been a vocal critic of the movement, which he has called a ""scam,"" and he recently sparked controversy by wearing a shirt with the words ""White Lives Matter"" at his Yeezy fashion show in Paris.

According to the Anti-Defamation League, the phrase ""White Lives Matter"" has racist connotations, and white-supremacist groups have used the phrase as a slogan.

In confusing and, at times contradictory, comments to the paparazzi, Ye seemed to take back some of his controversial comments while defending others.

He said that he did not realize that he could be antisemitic until he read a definition of the term, which said it included speaking about ""the myth of a world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling the media, economy, government or other societal institutions.""

""I didn't realize it was antisemitic to say, 'Hey, you know, I have a Jewish attorney, I have a Jewish record label, I have a Jewish contractor,'"" Ye said.

His recent antisemitic comments included saying he was ""going death con 3 on JEWISH PEOPLE,"" and have been widely condemned by Jewish groups and public figures.

Ye implied to the paparazzi that those comments were taken out of context, claiming the definition of that phrase is ""actually to get extra defense"" and that he ""needed that extra defense.""

His comments were understood to have meant to reference the military term ""Defcon 3,"" which means to ""force readiness increased above normal levels,"" according to Veteran."
Utah Republican apologises for saying women can control ‘intake of semen’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/01/utah-republican-women-control-intake-of-semen-abortion,nottheonion,"In the aftermath of the US supreme court decision that ended the right to abortion, amid nationwide protests over the removal of women’s control over their own bodies, one Utah Republican said women could “control [their] intake of semen”.

The comment by Karianne Lisonbee, a state representative, came in response to an assertion that men should be held accountable for unwanted pregnancies, not just pregnant women, the Salt Lake Tribune reported.

“I got a text message today saying I should seek to control men’s ejaculations and not women’s pregnancies,” Lisonbee said.

She added: “I do trust women enough to control when they allow a man to ejaculate inside of them and to control that intake of semen.”

Lisonbee spoke as conservatives celebrated the supreme court decision overturning Roe v Wade, the 1973 ruling which established the constitutional right to abortion.

The day after the ruling, Lisonbee walked back her statement.

“Women do not have a choice when they are raped and have protections under Utah’s trigger law,” she told the Tribune.

“My first statement in the press conference made clear the actions I have taken to pass bills that provide legal protection and recourse to victims of sexual assault.

“The political and social divide in America seems to be expanding at an ever-faster pace. I am committed to ongoing respectful and civil engagement. I can always do better and will continue to try.”

Angela Romero, a Democrat state representative who has promoted bills to help sexual assault victims, said she did not think Lisonbee meant to be “harmful”.

But Romero said she understood how a victim could see the remark and think politicians don’t believe that they were assaulted or abused.

“We have to be sensitive to how we phrase things because what we say impacts not just the people we represent, it impacts the entire state of Utah,” Romero told the Tribune.

Sonya Martinez-Ortiz, who leads the Utah Rape Recovery Center, told the paper: “Sexual assault in Utah is common, though often goes unreported.”

One 2016 survey found that one in six Utah women said they were raped, “higher than the national average”.

Several outlets which covered Lisonbee’s remarks took issue with her premise and tone.

“We can’t believe we even have to say this but … that is not true,” Self.com said.

In Esquire, Lisonbee’s remark was called “really icky”.

“Sorry, ma’am,” the magazine said. “I read what you said again, and once again, my immediate response was, ‘Oooooh, that’s just gross.’”"

Madison Cawthorn video: NC rep. responds to video showing him 'being crass' naked in bed with cousin,https://abc7ny.com/madison-cawthorn-tape-cousin-video/11820417/,nottheonion,"RALEIGH, N.C. -- An opposition group that is actively campaigning against Rep. Madison Cawthorn has released a video clip appearing to show the North Carolina Republican naked in bed and, as Cawthorn described it, ""being crass with a friend"" and ""acting foolish.""

After the video appeared on social media, Cawthorn tweeted, ""A new hit against me just dropped. Years ago, in this video, I was being crass with a friend, trying to be funny. We were acting foolish, and joking. That's it. I'm NOT backing down. I told you there would be a drip drip campaign. Blackmail won't win. We will.""

""This video is just stupid locker room talk between two cousins that grew up like brothers,"" Cawthorn said in a video posted to his social media pages.

It's the latest controversy for the 26-year-old, who is running for reelection with early voting already underway. The primary will be held on May 17.

The freshman Republican from North Carolina has angered and annoyed a number of his colleagues with a string of antics. Cawthorn became a national figure in 2020 when he beat then-President Donald Trump's endorsed candidate in the primary to replace then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows in Congress. But he has caused a number of distractions for House Republicans, who are trying to win the majority in November.

Late last month, Cawthorn was cited for bringing a loaded handgun through a Transportation Security Administration checkpoint at the Charlotte airport. And in February 2021, agents at the Asheville Regional Airport found an unloaded gun and a loaded magazine in Cawthorn's carry-on bag. A Cawthorn spokesman told the Asheville Citizen-Times when the paper published a story about the incident in July 2021 that the congressman had brought the gun ""by mistake."" Cawthorn was not charged.

In March, Cawthorn sparked an uproar after claiming on a podcast that people in Washington have invited him to participate in orgies and used cocaine in front of him. The episode prompted members of his own party to consider endorsing one of his primary opponents, according to multiple sources familiar with the discussions at the time, amid growing concerns that the North Carolina Republican was dragging down the party with his problematic behavior.

Sen. Thom Tillis has thrown his weight behind state Sen. Chuck Edwards in his primary against Cawthorn.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, amid complaints from members following Cawthorn's allegations, told the freshman lawmaker he needed to get his act together or else he could face internal consequences, saying also that Cawthorn admitted the allegations were untrue.

""He's got to turn himself around,"" McCarthy told reporters at the time. ""I just told him he's lost my trust, and he's going to have to earn it back. I laid out everything I find that's unbecoming. ... He's got a lot of members upset. You can't just make statements out there.""

CNN reported that same month that Cawthorn was facing charges of driving with a revoked driver's license -- the second time in the last five years he had faced that charge.

He also drew negative headlines when a video surfaced in which he referred to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a ""thug"" and said that the Ukrainian government was ""incredibly evil.""

In 2021, CNN reported on a series of allegations of sexual misconduct made against Cawthorn by women who said he behaved inappropriately toward them during his college years. Cawthorn has denied any wrongdoing.

Eve Online fans literally cheer Microsoft Excel features at annual Fanfest,https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/05/eve-onlines-ms-excel-partnership-makes-spreadsheets-in-space-official/,nottheonion,"There aren't many games for which built-in integration with Microsoft Excel would be a major feature whose announcement would draw literal cheers from fans. But Eve Online showed itself to be the exception when developer CCP announced coming Excel integration during its Eve Fanfest keynote this morning.

Through an official partnership with Microsoft, CCP said it is creating a JavaScript API that will allow players to ""seamlessly export data from Eve Online"" into the popular spreadsheet program. That ""will help players access and calculate everything from profit margins to battle strategy, making day-to-day Eve operations easier to execute,"" the company said in a press release.

""It's not April fools; this is real,"" Eve Online Creative Director Bergur Finnbogason said on the Fanfest stage, receiving bemused laughter in response. ""I'm not lying—we actually reached out to [Microsoft] and they were like, 'Oh my god, we love Eve!'""

Spreadsheets in space!

Joking references to Eve Online's reputation as a ""spreadsheets in space"" simulator date back well over a decade at this point. And CCP leaned into that reputation at Fanfest, with Finnbogason joking that a data-filled presentation on the game's economy by data scientist CCP Larrikin ""really, really, really, really make[s] Eve sound like 'spreadsheets in space.' It's hard to be a creative director sometimes when you have all the spreadsheet loving.""

Despite that, Finnbogason went on to acknowledge that ""data is massively important to many advanced playstyles in Eve."" And it's true; many individual players and in-game corporations use external tools and spreadsheets to track their resource production and destruction metrics in extreme detail. That data tracking can be key to efforts to maximize in-game currency, which can in turn be traded for additional game subscription time on the open market.

Los Angeles mayoral candidate Rick Caruso declares he's not white because he's Italian,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/los-angeles-mayoral-candidate-rick-caruso-declares-not-white-italian-rcna51852,nottheonion,"Los Angeles mayoral candidate Rick Caruso insisted he's not white but really Italian — and thus ""Latin"" — in an awkward debate moment Tuesday in the country's second-largest city.

Caruso, a billionaire real estate developer, faces U.S. Rep. Karen Bass, a Democrat seeking to become the city's first Black female mayor.

Next month's election comes in the wake of former City Council President Nury Martinez’s resignation from her council seat Wednesday after an audio recording of her making racist remarks surfaced.

In bringing up the scandal, Telemundo anchor Dunia Elvir said: “The next mayor of Los Angeles will be either an African American woman or a white man.""

“I’m Italian,” Caruso interjected.

Elvir responded, “Italian American,"" as Caruso insisted that his racial identification be stated on his terms.

“That’s ‘Latin,’ thank you,” Caruso said.

Caruso said he has for decades led efforts to bring more education opportunities and health care to Black and Latino communities in Los Angeles.

""I connect with the Latino community, but quite frankly my job as mayor is to connect with every community — the Latino community, the Black community, the Asian community, right? The Jewish community,"" said Caruso, who is running as a Democrat.

""If one group rises, we all rise. We do this together in unison, and we don't separate, we don't divide. But we all say to ourselves we can do this and we can have a better city.""

Caruso's ""Latin"" identity comment drew a harsh reaction, from scorn to mockery.

""Wow, did Caruso just say he is Latin? That he is not a white man?"" community activist Alberto Retana tweeted Tuesday night. ""I am floored. We cannot let him do this. Terrible.""

Comedy writer Nick Jack Pappas cracked that Caruso has as much connection to Latin Americans as Christopher Columbus.

""Can’t wait for Rick Caruso to claim Columbus was a Latino immigrant,"" he tweeted.

The Los Angeles Times reported Sunday that it had obtained 2021 audio from a political strategy meeting in which Martinez and City Council member Kevin De León used racist slurs to refer to council member Mike Bonin’s young son, who is Black. Bonin is white.

Martinez stepped down as president of the City Council on Monday and took a leave of absence from the council before she announced her resignation Wednesday.

Los Angeles is home to nearly 3.9 million residents, 48.1% percent of whom identify as Hispanic or Latino, 28.5% as non-Hispanic or Latino white, 11.8% as Asian and 8.8% as Black.

Caruso appeared to be hanging his ""Latin"" hat on cultural terms used outside the U.S., said Mark Hugo Lopez, the director of race and ethnicity research at the Pew Research Center.

""'Latin' is something in southern Europe. You'll hear people refer to themselves as 'Latins,' and that includes people who are Spanish, Portuguese, French and Italians,"" Lopez said Wednesday.

But in common American parlance, ""Latin"" generally refers to people who can trace their lineage to Latin American countries.

""'Latino' and 'Latin American,' those are really U.S.-based terms that have specific meanings, and it refers to people from Latin America,"" Lopez said."
Woman plans to sue after construction company mistakenly demolishes house,https://fox2now.com/news/national/woman-plans-to-sue-after-construction-company-mistakenly-demolishes-house/,nottheonion,"This is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.

MOBILE, Ala. (WKRG) – Jennifer Pulliam knows who mistakenly demolished her house in Alabama earlier this year. But while the mystery is solved, the legal battle is just beginning.

Over a weekend in January, someone came onto Pulliam’s property next to the Mobile Fairgrounds and tore down a home that had been in her family since the 1960s.

“I moved here when I was approximately 10 years old. This is my grandparent’s old homeplace. They bought it in 1965 and it’s been in our family ever since,” she said.

Pulliam, who lives and works in Leaksville, Mississippi, eventually got word about the demolition through a family member.

“They didn’t know that I was unaware of it until they saw the news story and then they contacted me,” she said.

“I cried for two days,” Pulliam added. “I was devastated.”

Other family members saw the story, which aired on WKRG, and contacted Pulliam with the name of a company seen on the property that weekend in January.

Pulliam said a Mobile Police investigator contacted the construction company and the owner confessed to demolishing the house, saying it was a mistake.

“I was not happy because they said they could not arrest them because there was no malicious intent … I would just have to sue them in civil court,” Pulliam said.

Pulliam, who had not publicly named the company on the advice of her attorney, said she is planning to file a lawsuit. She also claimed that the company’s owners have not contacted her to offer an apology — or anything else.

As for what kind of damages she hopes to recover, Pulliam didn’t immediately have an amount in mind.

“I’m not sure what they will come up with or how they will come up with it — that house to me is priceless.”"
TikTok pediatricians urge people to stop sharing 'dangerous' DIY baby formula recipes on social media,https://www.insider.com/tiktok-doctors-say-diy-formula-recipes-are-dangerous-2022-5,nottheonion,"Social-media pediatricians the PediPals urge people to stop sharing formula alternatives online.

Potentially harmful recipes have spread across social media plaforms during the nationwide shortage.

""There's no one size fits all,"" Dr. Ana said, which is why the recipes can be dangerous.

Viral social media posts offering supposed alternative recipes for baby formula have spread during the ongoing shortage of the product in the US, but medical experts with online followings are speaking out against the trend, calling the DIY substitutes dangerous.

Amateur baby formula recipes have spread across numerous platforms including on Twitter, TikTok, and YouTube, Bloomberg reported. While social media platforms have removed some videos that violate their rules prohibiting medical misinformation, the platforms haven't removed such videos consistently, the report said.

""We understand the need to try to do anything — to help each other out — but it seemed that it was just more and more videos and different recipes, all of which, if you have any kind of nutritional or medical background, you can see are extremely dangerous,"" said Dr. Sami, a Texas-based physician who is one-half of the PediPals, a pediatrician duo who makes social-media content to help educate parents on childcare.

At first, Sami told Insider she saw just a few videos promoting at-home formula recipes. But eventually, she said she realized there were more of them, and the videos were going ""more and more viral.""

Some videos promoting at-home formulas seen by Insider called for ingredients like evaporated milk and Karo syrup. Other TikTok creators called for hemp seeds, pitted dates, and vanilla. Some creators recommend that people feed infants goat milk as an alternative. All of these options care be potentially harmful to infants, doctors told Insider.

One recipe video seen by Insider had more than 1.4 million views on Friday.

Dr. Ana, also a Texas pediatrician and the other half of the PediPals, told Insider the videos she saw generally originated from creators who appeared to have ""no expertise at all"" in pediatric care.

""They say this worked for me, this worked for my mom, my grandma, and so this should obviously work for you,"" Ana said.

But that type of ""blanket advice"" can be dangerous, she said.

""There's no one size fits all, and the formula is so researched and there's so much that goes into putting all the right nutrients and electrolytes in because babies are very vulnerable,"" Ana told Insider.

Sami's frustration with these videos compelled her to make an impassioned plea on TikTok. In the May 15 video, which has 1.2 million views, Sami urged creators to stop sharing the recipes.

""Back in those days, infant mortality was just an accepted part of life,"" Sami said in the video, responding to people sharing recipes and advice passed down from previous generations that she says modern medicine has made obsolete.

""People used to pop out 8 to 10 babies, and 2 of them would die,"" she added. ""Our babies actually live, and we don't want to go back in time.""

Bad formula recipes could lead to health problems for babies

Improper nutrition from an at-home formula recipe could lead to several problems, including electrolyte imbalances and vitamin deficiencies, which could lead to seizures, heart issues, and problems with bone development, the doctors said.

""There are so many things that can happen,"" Ana said. ""And just because it doesn't happen to some people doesn't mean that other children can't suffer from this type of advice.""

Even too much water can be harmful to newborns, the PediPals added.

""It's all in the same realm of horrible because a kitchen is not a sterile environment,"" Sami said. ""Babies are super fragile, especially newborns, and especially babies under six months of age. They don't have fully developed kidneys. They can't just drink anything, so these recipes don't come from a place of safety or evidence. They're old wives' tales.""

Ana and Sami said they started PediPals in 2020 as a means to offer help and educate parents during the COVID-19 pandemic, but more recently they said they've found themselves debunking dangerous misinformation that's spread online.

At first, the duo started a podcast but later spread across social platforms, including TikTok, where they recently crossed 500,000 followers. They said they both worked full-time as pediatricians and made the social-media content on the side.

While platforms like TikTok have rules prohibiting medical misinformation, Ana and Sami are part of an entire subgenre of TikTok creators: medical experts who debunk and respond to inaccurate and dangerous misinformation spread on the app.

But speaking out against misinformation online is often difficult for creators, who previously told Insider they received death threats and harassment for making content calling out other creators for sharing bad information. The PediPals said they'd faced threats for doing things like speaking out about vaccines, abortion, and COVID-19.

The duo asked to be identified only by their first names, which are also their online identities as the PediPals, because of the threats they've received in the past.

""Medical creators are unfortunately targeted,"" Sami said. ""You have to have a lot of bravery if you want to talk about evidence-based medicine."""
"After a Texas school shooting, conservatives blamed ‘woke’ programs once approved by Republicans",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/texas-school-shooting-republicans-social-emotional-learning-rcna35540,nottheonion,"“MISD put ‘woke’ politics over the safety of our children,” the flyers read in all caps, above a news clipping about the Timberview shooting, which reportedly resulted from a fight between two Black students. The flyers, paid for by a conservative political action committee, warned that the Mansfield school district had “stopped disciplining students” based on “Critical Race Theory principles.” As a result, it said, “kids were nearly killed.”

But the Mansfield mailer omitted a key detail: Some of the local school policies that it was attacking were initially implemented three years ago, not as part of a liberal takeover of the suburban school system, but at the urging of Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and the Trump administration.

The mailers reflected a growing belief among some conservative parents, both in Mansfield and nationally, that school programs meant to address students’ emotional well-being have become vehicles for indoctrinating children with progressive ideas about race, gender and sexuality. The flyers, sent in mid-April ahead of a school board election, also previewed how some prominent Republicans would respond one month later after the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas — making a visceral connection between anti-racism initiatives in schools and parental fears about the physical safety of their children.

The fight in Mansfield reveals how quickly conservative messaging has evolved when it comes to hot-button debates over education, racism and school violence.

In the wake of school shootings in Texas and Florida in 2018, many Republican leaders, including Abbott, enthusiastically endorsed efforts to expand school-based social emotional learning programs, which they viewed as a way to prevent mass shootings without taking action on gun reform. Pointing to reams of academic studies, advocates say these teaching and disciplinary approaches help students cope with adversity while steering them away from violence.

Since last year, however, those educational concepts have been swept up in a movement to rid schools of initiatives meant to address racism and inequity — a conservative backlash that experts say is now threatening the very programs that Republicans once presented as a solution to school violence.

The flyers were paid for by a conservative political action committee. Zerb Mellish for NBC News

Far-right groups and grassroots parents have attacked social emotional learning — and related practices such as restorative discipline, which focuses on character development rather than punishment alone — as a “Trojan horse” for critical race theory, an academic study of racism that some on the right have used to label lessons on racism and gender that they find objectionable.

Conservative activists have seized on the fact that some social emotional learning programs encourage children to celebrate diversity, sometimes introducing students to conversations about race, gender and sexuality. And opponents take issue with one of the underlying goals of such initiatives: to reduce racial disparities in school disciplinary outcomes.

As a result, some Republican lawmakers who previously supported social emotional learning have soured on the concept. Several GOP-controlled state legislatures have considered bills to ban social emotional learning from schools. And many of the Republican proposals for stopping mass shootings following the massacre in Uvalde have instead focused on empowering schools and police to crack down harder on students who show signs of violence.

“It’s sort of ironic that these groups are throwing social emotional learning under the bus when these are the very things that our kids need now, and they need them now more than ever before,” said Donna Lord Black, who leads the Social Emotional Learning Alliance for Texas, a nonpartisan group that advocates for these programs in schools.

The result of this sudden partisan reversal: Education experts say one of the few bipartisan solutions to school violence has been reduced to another culture war talking point — one with the emotional power to potentially turn out voters while driving a deeper wedge between them.

In Mansfield — a quickly diversifying suburban school district that encompasses some areas that are majority Black, and some areas that are majority white — the political mailers blaming the Timberview shooting on “woke” school policies stirred intense feelings among residents.

The flyers included an image of a white child cowering in a school hallway under the words, “Restore safety. Restore sanity. It’s time for a new school board.”

VanDella Menifee believes the flyers were meant to divide the community. Zerb Mellish for NBC News

VanDella Menifee, the mother of a Black student who was at Timberview on the day of the shooting, said the mailers incorrectly implied the district had stopped disciplining non-white children at a high school where three-quarters of the students are Black or Latino.

“I believe those flyers were designed to play to parents’ fears and to divide this community,” Menifee said.

Mindy Stonecipher, a white mom who has criticized Mansfield’s social emotional learning and disciplinary policies, said she shared Menifee’s concerns about the political mailer, which she called “extreme.”

But Stonecipher, who leads a group of concerned parents called Voices for Mansfield, said she agrees with the flyer’s underlying point. She argues that Mansfield’s embrace of social emotional learning has tied up educators with new responsibilities and left some feeling powerless to discipline unruly students — ultimately, making classrooms less safe.

“This is a giant social experiment,” Stonecipher said. “And the public school system is the lab.”

‘A pathway to hope’

The shooting at Timberview High School on Oct. 6 started with a fight between two students, according to police and video of the classroom brawl later posted on social media. After a teacher broke up the altercation, witnesses told police that one of the students, an 18-year-old senior, walked over to a backpack, pulled out a handgun and opened fire.

A teacher and two students were wounded; no one was killed. One of the teens spent two weeks in the hospital recovering. The accused shooter was arrested and charged with three counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.

At a town hall meeting two weeks later, Bruno Dias, the school district’s director of safety, security and threat management, gave a presentation outlining Mansfield’s efforts to prevent classroom violence. That included a threat assessment and social emotional learning program implemented under a 2019 Texas law that was passed with broad bipartisan support and signed by Abbott following a mass shooting at Santa Fe High School near Houston.

“It is a requirement, it is a mandate, and we are excelling at it,” Dias said of the program. “It is important to note that we’ve been able, in multiple cases, to turn what could have become a pathway to violence as it relates to students into a pathway to hope because of this threat assessment process.”"
Texas burglar cuts victim’s grass before fleeing with lawnmower,https://www.kxan.com/news/weird-news/texas-burglar-cuts-victims-grass-before-fleeing-with-lawnmower/,nottheonion,"PORT ARTHUR, Texas (KXAN) — At least someone got their lawn mowed during an April 1 burglary in Port Arthur, Texas.

The Port Arthur Police Department posted about the bizarre incident Thursday on its Facebook page and said it is still looking for the suspect, identified as Marcus Hubbard.

PAPD said Hubbard went into a person’s yard and took a lawnmower out of a building without the owner’s permission. Instead of immediately leaving the yard, he apparently wanted to make sure the mower was in good working condition. He mowed the front and back yards of the home, as seen on surveillance footage, and then he left while dragging the mower behind him.

He eventually abandoned the lawnmower in a nearby alley and escaped police, the post said. PAPD said it issued a warrant for his arrest.

PAPD said if anyone knows Hubbard’s whereabouts to call 409-983-8600 or Crime Stoppers of SE Texas at 409-833-8477."

Then-President Donald Trump would have had to squeeze through an ""extremely tight"" space to be able to grab the steering wheel of an SUV and lunge at a Secret Service agent, as a former White House aide, Cassidy Hutchinson, testified Tuesday.

It wouldn't be impossible, one former Secret Service agent said, but it would be unlikely that the 6-foot-3, nearly 250-pound Trump, who the agent noted is ""not the most agile human being,"" could pull off the move.

""Trump's not a little guy, right? And the space to actually be able to lunge towards the wheel is not that big,"" the former agent said, speaking on background to Insider. ""I don't mean to sound disparaging to the former president, but just his girth would prevent him from actually getting to the steering wheel.""

Hutchinson's recounting of the SUV incident was one of the most explosive allegations during an extraordinary day of testimony on Tuesday to the House committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. Hutchinson said she was told the incident occurred when Bobby Engel — the special agent in charge of Trump's security — prevented Trump from joining his supporters at the Capitol. She recounted a description of the incident, which she said was relayed to her shortly afterward by Tony Ornato, the White House deputy chief of staff for operations at the time, and that Engel was in the room.

""The president reached up towards the front of the vehicle to grab at the steering wheel,"" she said during her testimony. ""Mr. Engel grabbed his arm, said, 'Sir, you need to take your hand off the steering wheel, we're going back to the West Wing, we're not going to the Capitol.' Mr. Trump then used his free hand to lunge towards Bobby Engel,"" Hutchinson said, adding that Ornato ""motioned towards his clavicles"" when recounting the story.

Engel previously told the committee about a disagreement over Trump's desire to go to the Capitol and that they returned to the White House instead, Politico reported last month. But CBS News and NBC News have reported that Secret Service agents are prepared to testify that Trump didn't try to take control of the SUV or lunge at them.

""We have and will continue to make any member of the Secret Service available to the committee,"" Anthony Guglielmi, a Secret Service spokesperson, told Insider.

Former Secret Service agents questioned the account in interviews with Insider.

""There's just too much gray area to bet the farm on it,"" Bill Pickle, a former deputy assistant director of the Secret Service, said. ""Am I saying it didn't happen? I'm not going to say that, because we all know this guy can be pretty emotional.""

The fully armored SUV isn't like a typical Suburban. There are security features separating the front and back seats and jump seats in the back that make the space ""extremely tight,"" the former agent who spoke on background said.

""You have to slightly be a contortionist to get from the back cabin to the front cabin, and the president's not a contortionist,"" he added.

Agents are trained to move from the front into the back seats quickly in the event of a medical situation. ""It's ridiculous. I mean, it's not a pretty sight,"" the former agent said, adding that it's ""hard to believe"" the president would do that.

""It's not impossible, right?,"" the former agent said with a laugh. ""I just, I don't see this president ever being able to do that. Ever."""

"Very hungry bear ‘Hank the Tank’ is in fact three bears, DNA shows",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/25/very-hungry-bear-hank-the-tank-is-in-fact-three-bears-dna-shows,nottheonion,"DNA evidence has shown that the 500-pound black bear the public had nicknamed Hank the Tank is, in fact, at least three not-so-little bears who have damaged more than 30 properties around Lake Tahoe in recent months.

The Department of Fish and Wildlife on Thursday said it would soon begin trapping bears in the South Lake Tahoe area to tag the animals and collect evidence for genetic analysis. The bears will be released in a “suitable habitat” and the agency said no trapped animals will be euthanised as part of the project.

The bears are responsible for more than 150 incident reports in the region straddling Northern California and Nevada, including a break-in at a residence in the Tahoe Keys neighbourhood last week.

One of the Hanks smashed a window on Friday and squeezed into the house on Catalina Drive while the residents were at home, CBS Sacramento reported. Police responded and banged on the exterior of the house until Hank exited out the back door and disappeared into the woods.

Also known as Jake or Yogi or simply Big Guy, the then-solo bear was what one wildlife official described as a “severely food habituated bear” that has “lost all fear of people” and thinks of them as a food source.

“What’s problematic about this bear is how large it is,” Peter Tira, a spokesperson for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, told SF Gate on Sunday.

“It’s learned to use that size and strength to break into a number of occupied residences, bursting through the garage door or front door.”

Once the trapping efforts begin, the three Hanks – at least – may well form a brigade."

The former owner of a Bucks County CrossFit gym who recorded herself during the storming of the Capitol saying she was looking for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi “to shoot her in the friggin’ brain” was sentenced to 60 days’ incarceration Thursday.

But Dawn Bancroft, 60, of Doylestown hasn’t let her conviction for participating in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection dull her interest in politics.

The onetime owner of Bucks County Elite Fitness ran for and won a spot as a committeeperson in the county’s Republican Party in May’s primary election.

Reached Thursday to discuss Bancroft’s role in the Capitol attack, her prison sentence, and how that might affect her position with the local party, county GOP Chair Patricia K. Poprick said she and Bancroft have never met.

“I think we’ll have to have a conversation with her about all that,” Poprick said.

U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan, meanwhile, was more resolute as he announced Bancroft’s sentence on the single misdemeanor count of illegally demonstrating on Capitol grounds to which she pleaded guilty last year.

He called her threats to Pelosi “unacceptable” and couched the punishment he imposed as a signal to “misguided souls” who might be inspired to act on what Bancroft described as an idle threat.

“There has to be a message to the others out there that these type of comments have no place in a democratic, civilized society,” he said.

For her part, Bancroft called her remarks “inappropriate, childish, and foolish.” And her attorney, Carina Laguzzi, insisted her client had neither the intention nor the means to attack the House speaker.

“Who hasn’t told their spouse, ‘I am going to kill you if you leave your shoes on the carpet again!’” Laguzzi wrote in court filings in advance of the hearing, adding: “If it were not for the political undercurrent of this case … this court would not even consider incarceration as an option.”

The sentence Sullivan imposed — which also included orders for three years’ probation, 100 hours of community service, and restitution of $500 — made Bancroft the 22nd Pennsylvania defendant to face punishment for a role in the insurrection, which caused millions of dollars in damage, injured scores of officers, and threatened the peaceful transition of power.

In all, more than 840 Americans face charges for participating in or planning the riot — and nearly 70 of them hail from Pennsylvania.

Bancroft’s is one of the longest prison terms imposed so far against defendants from the Keystone State, though cases involving some of the more serious allegations — including attacking police or playing a central role in the planning of the attack — remain pending.

Also Thursday, Sullivan sentenced Diana Santos-Smith — an Upper Black Eddy housekeeper and former hospice care nurse who traveled with Bancroft to Washington that day and who appeared in her video — to 20 days.

“What I did was the utmost betrayal, so I do want to be punished for my crime,” she told the judge. She added: “I didn’t want to leave Dawn alone. That was the only thought in my mind. … Also, I didn’t want her to do anything crazy.”

Lawyers for both women argued that neither had intended to be caught up in a riot when they traveled from Doylestown to Washington that day. Yet they still found themselves among the mob of supporters of former President Donald Trump that stormed the building.

Surveillance video showed Bancroft and Santos-Smith, 32, entering twice through already-shattered windows. Bancroft — wearing a red MAGA beanie and with a flag emblazoned with the words “All Aboard the Trump Train” over her shoulders — appeared to shoot a video on her cell phone of the chaos unfolding inside before climbing back out less than a minute later.

But it was the video she shot as she and Santos-Smith left the Capitol grounds that became the focus for much of the argument at her sentencing hearing.

“We broke into the Capitol. We got inside. We did our part,” she said in the cell phone footage. “We were looking for Nancy to shoot her in the friggin’ brain. We didn’t find her.”

The women stopped to thank Capitol police officers for their service on their way out.

Unlike many of the rioters who have since been charged, Bancroft did not post the video to social media, sending it only to one of her friends. That person forwarded it to the Upper Dublin Police Department, which alerted the FBI.

On Thursday, Laguzzi dismissed her client’s comments as empty “bravado.” She maintained that, like the other rioters, Bancroft had marched to the Capitol on Trump’s direction only for him “to turn his back on them.”

Now, Laguzzi said, news of her arrest and participation in the riot is all that shows up when you Google Bancroft’s name. As a result, Bancroft has been threatened, harassed, lost her gym’s CrossFit affiliation, and was ultimately forced to sell her business after more than half of her clients left.

But Assistant U.S. Attorney Sean P. Murphy balked at that plea for sympathy and argued that, despite Bancroft’s claims of remorse, Laguzzi’s arguments to keep her out of prison amounted to little more than excuses and “whataboutism.”

“There’s blame laid on President Trump. She lays blame on CrossFit. There’s blame placed on Google,” he said. “Being a top result in Google is something that’s going to happen when you’re a participant in one of the most culturally significant crimes of our lifetime.”

Ultimately, the judge fell somewhere in the middle. He said he’d considered imposing an even longer sentence for Bancroft than the government was requesting and in Santos-Smith’s case, exceeded the term prosecutors were pushing by six days.

But he lauded both women as “decent people” who got caught up in the moment and assured them he’d recommend they serve their sentences in a halfway house instead of a federal detention facility.

“Wrong place, wrong time, wrong company,” Sullivan said. “It is what it is. … The big concern the court has is deterrence to others.”

CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story contained a quote that was incorrectly attributed to a court filing written by Bancroft’s attorney, Carina Laguzzi. The quote came from a report authored by a mitigation expert that Laguzzi submitted as part of that filing."
"Fan buys Tom Brady's ""last"" touchdown football for $518,628 — then Brady unretires",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tom-brady-leland-auction-500000-nfl/,nottheonion,"An unknown fan paid more than half a million dollars for the last football Tom Brady threw in an NFL game before retiring last season. But the ball has now lost much of its value after the 44-year-old athlete announced Sunday that he is returning to professional football, experts said.

The football sold for $518,628 on Saturday through New Jersey auction company Lelands, with the high price driven in part by the belief that it was used for what would be the last touchdown pass ever thrown by one of the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history. Roughly 24 hours after the auction closed, Brady announced via Twitter that he would return to the NFL, marking a tough break for the winning bidder.

""The ball is worth a lot less now,"" sports memorabilia expert David Kohler told CBS MoneyWatch, adding that once Brady throws another touchdown, the ball's value will be ""a fraction of what it was worth.""

This football sold for more than $500,000 during a public auction in March 2022. NFL quarterback Tom Brady used it while playing a playoff game against the Los Angeles Rams. Lelands

It's unclear if the auction winner intended to keep the football or sell it for a higher price later. Lelands declined to identify the winning bidder.

""I just hate to be the guy who paid $500,000 for Tom Brady's last touchdown pass,"" CBS Sports host Adam Zucker told CBS News.

Brady is the only quarterback in history to win a championship over age 40 with two NFL different teams. He has won seven NFL championships and appeared in 10 Super Bowls over a span of 22 seasons. Brady also has thrown the most touchdown passes of any player in league history and has been selected Super Bowl MVP five times.

Brady used the football sold at auction on January 23 in Tampa, Florida, to throw a 55-yard touchdown pass to teammate Mike Evans during a playoff game against the Los Angeles Rams. After scoring, Evans threw the ball into the stands at Raymond James Stadium. A person in the crowd caught the ball and decided to auction it.

""If Evans had not tossed it into the stands, it would still be in the possession of the Buccaneers and would never be offered publicly,"" Lelands wrote in its listing for the football.

Brady's sports memorabilia has a history for selling at high prices. For example, an autographed rookie card of Brady sold last June at auction for $3.1 million. The football used to complete his first career touchdown sold for more than $400,000 last May."
China gives 'Fight Club' new ending where authorities win,https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/2253199/china-gives-fight-club-new-ending-where-authorities-win,nottheonion,"China gives 'Fight Club' new ending where authorities win

China has some of the world's most restrictive censorship rules with authorities only approving a handful of foreign films for release each year

BEIJING - The first rule of Fight Club in China? Don't mention the original ending. The second rule of Fight Club in China? Change it so the police win.

China has some of the world's most restrictive censorship rules with authorities only approving a handful of foreign films for release each year -- sometimes with major cuts.

Among the latest movies to undergo such treatment is David Fincher's 1999 cult classic ""Fight Club"" starring Brad Pitt and Edward Norton.

Film fans in China noticed over the weekend that a version of the movie newly available on streaming platform Tencent Video was given a makeover that transforms the anarchist, anti-capitalist message that made the film a global hit.

In the closing scenes of the original, Norton's character The Narrator, kills off his imaginary alter ego Tyler Durden -- played by Pitt -- and then watches multiple buildings explode, suggesting his character's plan to bring down modern civilisation is underway.

But the new version in China has a very different take.

The Narrator still proceeds with killing off Durden, but the exploding building scene is replaced with a black screen and a coda: ""The police rapidly figured out the whole plan and arrested all criminals, successfully preventing the bomb from exploding"".

It then adds that Tyler -- a figment of The Narrator's imagination -- was sent to a ""lunatic asylum"" for psychological treatment and was later discharged.

-'Too outrageous' -

The new ending in which the state triumphs sparked head scratching and outrage among many Chinese viewers -- many of whom would likely have seen pirated versions of the unadulterated version film.

""This is too outrageous,"" one viewer commented on Tencent Video.

""'Fight Club' on Tencent Video tells us that they don't just delete scenes, but add to the plot too,"" a user wrote on the Twitter-like Weibo platform.

It is not currently clear if government censors ordered the alternative ending or if the original movie's producers made the changes.

Tencent did not comment on the matter.

Hollywood studios often release alternative cuts in the hopes of clearing Beijing's censorship hurdles and getting lucrative access to millions of Chinese consumers.

In 2019, multiple scenes in the film ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" referencing iconic musician Freddie Mercury's sexuality –- a pivotal part of his biography -– were dropped in its China release.

Under President Xi Jinping, Chinese authorities have pushed to purge society of elements deemed unhealthy, including within movies, television, computer games.

They have also launched sweeping state crackdowns on tax evasion and perceived immoral behaviour in the entertainment industry, a tightening that has already targeted some of the country's biggest celebrities.

On Tuesday, the Cyberspace Administration of China announced it was launching a month-long ""clean"" web campaign to create a ""civilised and healthy"" atmosphere online over the Lunar New Year holiday."
Chicago man who spent nearly 20 years in prison for murder released after twin brother confesses to crime,https://www.fox32chicago.com/news/chicago-man-who-spent-nearly-20-years-in-prison-for-murder-released-after-twin-brother-confesses-to-crime,nottheonion,"A convicted felon who spent nearly 20 years in prison for murder was released after his identical twin brother turned himself in for the crime.

Kevin Dugar was released from Chicago's Cook County jail on Wednesday after a motion for bond was granted. In 2003, Dugar was convicted for a gang-related murder in Chicago. His twin brother, Karl Smith, confessed to being the culprit 10 years later in a letter he wrote to Dugar.

""I have to get it off my chest before it kills me,"" Smith wrote in a 2013 letter to his imprisoned brother, as he confessed to the crime. ""So I’ll just come clean and pray you can forgive me.""

Although a judge denied a retrial for Dugar in 2018, questioning the credibility of the confession, the decision was later reversed by the Court of Appeal. Dugar's attorney, Ron Safer, argued that a jury would determine a different outcome, given the new evidence to the case.

After Smith's confession, prosecutors argued that Smith only came clean after he was convicted for his involvement in a 2008 home invasion and armed robbery that left a 6-year-old boy shot in the head. He was already serving a 99-year prison sentence for his participation.

Kevin Dugar is set to live in a residential transitional facility for 90 days as a condition of his release, according to reports from the Chicago Tribune. His attorney says he hopes his client's case will not be retried.

""This case is in a very different situation than it was 20 years ago,"" Safer told the Tribune.

"TikTokers are telling viewers to point their genitals at the sun to 'increase your vibrations.' Experts warn against it, but 'perineum sunning' keeps going viral.",https://www.insider.com/perineum-sunning-your-holes-tiktok-trend-wellness-experts-2022-9,nottheonion,"Videos about perineum sunning are getting millions of views on TikTok.

Influencers are encouraging people to expose this area to the sun to absorb its ""natural energy.""

Health experts say the practice has no known positive effect and could be damaging to the skin.

Videos about ""perineum sunning"" to increase a person's ""vibrations"" are gaining millions of views on TikTok, but experts say there is no evidence that the practice has any benefit, and could even be harmful.

Perineum sunning is a controversial wellness practice where a person exposes their genitals to the sun for a short period of time. While naked, some lie on their back with their legs spread wide in the air, or with their feet and hands on the ground in a variation of a yoga downward dog pose. The idea is to expose the perineum area to vitamin D in order to receive an energy boost that they say can improve sleep, concentration, and creativity.

The practice has been promoted by wellness influencers in the past, but has blown up on TikTok in recent months. The hashtag #perineumsunning (also referred to as ""sunning your holes"" by some creators) has over two million views on TikTok. Though many of the posts mock or question the practice, there are many popular videos that praise and encourage it.

TikToker @PaulyLong, who is considered a ""raw meat influencer"" received 8.5 million views on a video he posted on July 31 where he showed himself and a woman lying on their backs with their legs in the air to expose the perineum to the sun. On-screen text read, ""Think about it... why would you not sun the most vital area of your body? The more you hide your body part from the sun, the weaker it will be.""

Long has posted three subsequent videos espousing the benefits of perineum sunning, stating that the perineal area needs ""natural energy,"" and that absorbing sunlight ""supports bone health, lowers blood pressure, and promotes incredible mental health."" Health experts previously told Insider there is also no evidence that perineum sunning has an effect on physical wellbeing.

In another video, Long said he practices perineum sunning for ""10-15 minutes a day."" In response to a request for comment by Insider, Long confirmed that he does ""5-10 minute rounds of perineal sunning.""

He told Insider, ""See how your body reacts, and proceed with caution. This is not medical advice, nor am I a doctor. But, I believe we will indeed start to see studies about perineal sunning come out in the next 2-5 years, and they will show its benefits.""

Long also said that perineal sunning should be done in combination with ""an animal based diet,"" which he said prevents him from burning in the sun.

A TikTok creator who goes by the username @laurenannekennedy also posted about the practice on June 27. The video, which had nearly 500,000 views, shows her bending over with her head to the ground in order to expose her backside to the sun. Text on the video said, ""People always ask me how I am so happy all the time. Sunning your holes for 2 minutes a day will increase your vibrations."" Kennedy did not immediately return Insider's request for comment.

Many commenters under these posts were skeptical of the claims about the practice.

TikToker and dermatologist Dustin Portela responded to Long's claims in a video to warn against perineum sunning, and said he has removed skin cancer from the perineal area before, and that the risks of exposing your perineum are not worth it.

It's not the first time the practice has had a moment on TikTok. A creator by the name of @jenn_dances4fun encouraged perineum sunning in a video posted in 2020, where she said, ""30 seconds of perineum sunning is equivalent to walking around in the sun with your clothes on all day long."" The video received 6.1 million views.

In a later video, she stated that her video about perineum sunning was ""a joke,"" but did not elaborate further. In response to Insider's request for comment, the creator confirmed that she did not truly believe in perineum sunning.

Wellness influencers have praised perineum sunning as far back as 2019, Insider's Lindsay Dodgson reported at the time. Instagram ""healer"" @MetaphysicalMeagan claimed that the practice helped her to regulate her sleep, and increased her sexual energy and creativity.

She also said it is an ancient Taoist practice that originated in the Far East. While Taoists do place an importance on the perineum, there is no evidence that perineum sunning is a part of Taoist belief, according to Healthline.

Dr Diana Gall from Doctor-4-U told Insider at the time, ""Yes, practicing mindfulness and meditation, and getting your dose of Vitamin D, is beneficial for mental and physical health, but you don't need to damage your skin in the process from sun exposure.""

She explained that exposing your skin directly can increase risks of skin cancer.

Dr Stephanie Ooi from MyHealthcare Clinic previously told Insider, ""This is a classic example of social media medical misinformation which in some cases can be damaging or dangerous.""

Boebert seeks funding for Glenwood Springs bridge after voting against bill that would fund it,https://www.durangoherald.com/articles/boebert-seeks-funding-for-glenwood-springs-bridge-after-voting-against-bill-that-would-fund-it/,nottheonion,"Congresswoman is asking for $33.1 million

U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert is seeking funding from an infrastructure bill that she voted against in March.

Boebert wants $33.1 million for the South Bridge in Glenwood Springs, according to a newsletter from her office. She also sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg advocating construction of the Glenwood Springs bridge.

×

The city is requesting $33.1 million in Rural Surface Transportation grant money to complete the project, which would create a second point of access between Colorado State Highway 82 and the western side of the Roaring Fork River in the south Glenwood Springs area.

Boebert voted against President Joe Biden’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, calling the legislation “wasteful” and “garbage” on Twitter. Rural Surface Transportation grant funding began under former President Barack Obama’s Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act in 2015.

In her letter to Buttigieg, Boebert said, “Glenwood Springs’ South Bridge Project aligns with the Rural Surface Transportation program’s goals to improve and expand the surface transportation infrastructure in rural areas to increase connectivity, improve the safety and reliability of the movement of people, generate regional economic growth, and improve the quality of life for residents of the Lower Colorado River Valley and the Roaring Fork Valley. This connection will also reduce traffic congestion, improve safety along State Highway 82, and will protect hundreds of lives in the event of a fast-moving fire.”

In an email to The Durango Herald, Boebert said the bill she introduced, America’s Infrastructure Modernization Act, is a “real solution” for funding infrastructure.

“I am for investing in rural Colorado, but Biden’s so-called infrastructure bill was not the right way to do it,” she said. “Less than 10% of (the) $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill went to roads and bridges. The bill provides tens of billions of dollars for Solyndra style slush funds, Green New Deal policies, electric busses (sic), and government welfare.”

Boebert’s bill would have drawn on unspent COVID-19 funding to fund infrastructure projects, Boebert said.

“100% of my bill goes to a targeted, efficient infrastructure plan that works for America. My bill would not increase federal spending or taxes, since it would reallocate $650 billion of the remaining unspent COVID funds,” she told the Herald.

The project has a local match commitment of $24 million, including a $20 million local cash match and a $4 million commitment from the Roaring Fork Transportation Authority. In her letter, Boebert stressed the importance of the bridge during emergency situations.

“With Rural Surface Transportation grant funds, Glenwood Springs will construct a new bridge connection that will provide a critical second emergency route/evacuation access between State Highway 82 and the western side of the Roaring Fork River in the City’s South Corridor,” Boebert wrote.

In March, Boebert also celebrated funding that she voted against from the same bill, with a newsletter distributed by her office afterward touting “nine Boebert wins for Colorado.” Boebert is also against the use of earmarks, which provide federal funding for local projects.

Jupiter CEO Quits $68 Billion Firm to Sit at the Beach and ‘Do Nothing’,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/jupiter-ceo-quits-68-billion-firm-to-sit-at-the-beach-and-do-nothing-1.1784775,nottheonion,"(Bloomberg) -- Andrew Formica, the chief executive officer of Jupiter Fund Management Plc, suddenly announced he’s leaving the £55.3 billion ($67.9 billion) asset manager he joined in 2019.

Formica, 51, will leave the position on Oct. 1 and will also resign as a director of the London-based company on that date, according to a statement Tuesday. He will be succeeded by Matthew Beesley, the company’s chief investment officer, who will take up the role of CEO with effect from that time.

Formica, who has been in the UK for almost three decades, said in a telephone interview that his departure was down to personal reasons, including wanting to be closer to elderly parents.

“I just want to go sit at the beach and do nothing,” he said in the interview. “I’m not thinking about anything else.”

Formica joined Jupiter from Janus Henderson Group Plc, where he had orchestrated the merger between US fund house Janus and UK firm Henderson in 2017. He lost out in a leadership battle at Janus Henderson in 2018 to Dick Weil, his co-CEO after the combination.

Clients have pulled cash from Jupiter for four years in a row and the firm has failed to stem the outflows this year. In the first three months of the year, investors yanked another £1.6 billion, according to its latest earnings report.

Formica will remain in the business to the end of June 2023. Beesley joined Jupiter in January this year as CIO and was previously CIO at Artemis Investment Management. The board looked at external candidates as well before settling on Beesley, Formica said in the interview.

Beesley doesn’t plan to change the firm’s strategy, he said in a telephone interview after the announcement. Though he will give more details about his intentions when he takes over at Jupiter. Jupiter hasn’t yet settled on a replacement CIO, he added.

"Idaho House Republicans kill library budget, citing ‘harmful’ materials, pornography",https://www.eastidahonews.com/?p=529617,nottheonion,"BOISE (Idaho Statesman) — On what was slated to be the second-to-last day of the legislative session, Idaho House Republicans killed the budget for the Idaho Commission for Libraries after debate over controversial materials in libraries.

The bill died Thursday in a 33-36 vote. The budget before the House included a cut of about $300,000 that had been used for a statewide e-book collection for K-12 students.

Assistant Minority Leader Lauren Necochea, D-Boise, in a statement called the vote “senseless retribution” against librarians who spoke out against a previous bill that would have removed legal protections for schools, colleges, universities and libraries to disseminate “harmful” materials to minors. That bill passed the House but didn’t get a hearing in the Senate.

“The revised budget already punished Idaho students, reducing their access to books so that House GOP legislators could make a political statement,” Necochea said. “Ultimately, Idaho’s children are paying the price with diminished access to books, especially in schools with limited resources.”

RELATED | Idaho bill to fine, jail librarians appears dead in Senate

Lawmakers who debated against the bill raised concerns about the materials in libraries and whether they could be harmful to children.

The budget for the commission for the next fiscal year appropriates about $11.2 million, including federal funds. The budget also requires that libraries verify resources for K-12 students comply with sections in Idaho code on “obscene materials.”

It also requests the Idaho Commission for Libraries provide a written report to legislators by September on “progress in complying with this section and any associated internal audits.”

The Idaho Library Association said in a March 19 email that it condemns censorship and supports access to a “wide variety of viewpoints.”

“As trained professionals, we recognize that not every viewpoint, book, audiobook, program or video is for everyone and provide a variety of materials accordingly,” the email said. “This is why we also support parents and families in their ability to choose from among our collections what they want to read, so that everyone has a voice or viewpoint to choose from.”

The budget will have to go back to the Legislature’s budget-setting committee for approval, then go through the process of approval again in the full Senate and House. The budget must be passed before the Legislature can adjourn for the session, which was expected to end Friday.

HOUSE GOP WANTS LIBRARIES LIABLE FOR ‘HARMFUL’ MATERIALS

A bill that House lawmakers approved earlier this month would have removed an exemption given to schools, public libraries, universities, and museums regarding distributing harmful materials to minors.

Idaho law essentially doesn’t define harmful materials. Idaho code says that someone is guilty of disseminating such materials that include “nudity, sexual conduct or sado-masochistic abuse” or “any other material harmful to minors.” The penalties for disseminating harmful materials include up to one year in jail and up to a $1,000 fine.

RELATED | Librarians worry they could face criminal penalty under bill if kids obtain ‘harmful material’

Supporters of the bill, which was not heard in the Senate, said it was important to keep inappropriate and pornographic materials out of the hands of children.

But opponents and librarians noted that taken out of context, many materials could appear harmful to children. They also said the bill was vague and criminalized librarians.

"Noem defends no exception for rape, incest in South Dakota trigger law",https://www.ktvq.com/news/national-news/noem-defends-no-exception-for-rape-incest-in-south-dakota-trigger-law,nottheonion,"South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem on Sunday defended her state's abortion trigger law that took effect after the Supreme Court's decision to strip away the constitutional right to an abortion. She said in an interview with ""Face the Nation"" that in the cases of rape or incest, she does not believe one tragedy is ""a reason to have another tragedy occur.""

""I believe every life is precious ... And we know so much more using technology and science than we did even 10, 15 years ago about what these babies go through the pain that they feel in the womb, and will continue to make sure that those lives are protected,"" Noem said. ""And I just have never believed that having a tragedy or tragic situation happened to someone is a reason to have another tragedy occur.""

South Dakota is one of 13 states with so-called ""trigger laws"" on the books, in which abortion would be outlawed immediately or soon after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark decision that established the constitutional right an abortion.

The high court's ruling Friday striking down Roe — in a case involving a Mississippi law banning abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy — put those laws into effect. South Dakota's measure, signed into law in 2005, prohibits the performance of abortions, except to save the life of the mother, and bans anyone from prescribing a woman drugs that induce an abortion. The law is ""effective on the date that the states are recognized by the United States Supreme Court to have the authority to regulate or prohibit abortion at all stages of pregnancy.""

Noem said her state will now work to bolster resources for women who will now have to carry their pregnancies to term, including with more mental health counseling and family services.

CBS News South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem on ""Face the Nation,"" June 206, 2022.





""I would prefer that we continue to make sure we go forward and that we're putting resources in front of these women and walking alongside them, getting them the health care, the care, the mental health counseling and services that they should need to make sure that we can continue to support them and build stronger families far into the future as well,"" she said, adding, ""The Supreme Court did its job: it fixed a wrong decision it made many years ago and returned this power back to the states, which is how the Constitution and our Founders intended it.""

The court's decision made clear that the issue of abortion is one that will now be decided by elected officials in the states, but it also has set the stage for future legal fights about whether states can impose bans on Mifepristone, a FDA-approved drug that is used together with a second medication to induce an abortion within the first 10 weeks of pregnancy.

Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement Friday in response to the Supreme Court's ruling that states may not ban Mifepristone ""based on disagreement with the FDA's expert judgment about its safety and efficacy.""

Noem in March signed a bill into law that restricted access to medication abortion by requiring women make at least three trips to a clinic to obtain the drugs and defended the limits she has imposed.

""It's something that should be under the supervision of a medical doctor and it is something in South Dakota that we've made sure happens that way,"" she said. ""There are certain protections that are guarded under the Constitution of the United States. The rest of these items are left to the states, the 10th Amendment guarantees us that.""

In addition to spotlighting abortion pills, the court's decision also raised questions about whether states that ban abortion can penalize companies that have announced they will cover expenses for employees who travel across state lines to obtain an abortion.

Noem suggested she would not go after corporations such as Walmort or Amazon that have workers in her state and have pledged to reimburse employees who get abortions elsewhere.

""We're going to continue to support these mothers, make sure that they are protected from any kind of prosecution that would happen, make sure that these babies are recognized and that every single life is precious, and that we enforce our laws and I'll continue to make sure that the people of our state and all they can speak to their elected representatives that will make those decisions closer to home than what we're seeing at the federal level,"" she said. ""No intention to do that.""

She also said she does not anticipate South Dakota will take up proposals that incentivize residents to report women suspected of seeking or aiding in abortions, like a law passed in Texas.

""That's never been the conversation in South Dakota, and I don't anticipate that we will ever do that. We take privacy rights very important, we protect our freedom and our liberties here,"" she said. ""We will make sure that mothers have the resources, protection and medical care that they need, and we're being aggressive on that."""
"Texas judge invites Disney World to relocate, calls Florida authoritarian &amp; anti-business",https://www.wfla.com/news/florida/texas-judge-invites-disney-world-to-relocate-calls-florida-authoritarian-anti-business/,nottheonion,"TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) — A Texas judge wrote a letter to Disney’s CEO inviting the company to move its Walt Disney World resort to the Lone Star State after its issues with Florida’s state government.

Friday, Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill dissolving the Reedy Creek Improvement District, Disney’s private government that has been in place for 55 years.

This came after Disney openly opposed the Parental Rights in Education Bill, also known as the “Don’t Say Gay” Bill. Last March, the company announced it would end its political donations in Florida and instead support organizations in opposition to the law.

In the midst of DeSantis’ feud with the Disney Company, Fort Bend County Judge JP George, the chief executive officer of Fort Bend County, Texas, wrote a letter inviting the company to relocate to his area and avoid “authoritarian, anti-business, and culture war attacks from extremists in Florida.”

The letter, addressed to CEO Bob Chapek, promoted his county as an ideal location for the large amounts of purchasable land and its strategic location in the state of Texas.

“In fact, major employers like Amazon, Texas Instruments, Comcast, Gallery Furniture, and others have recently made vast investments in our community including thousands of good paying jobs with many more employers on the way,” George wrote.

In addition to inviting Disney to invest in Fort Bend County, the judge also invited Twitter to look into his home county as well."
"Dublin Airport got 12,272 noise complaints last year from just one person",https://independent.ie/irish-news/news/dublin-airport-got-12272-noise-complaints-last-year-from-just-one-person-41560228.html,nottheonion,"One person was responsible for nine in 10 of all complaints about noise from aircraft using Dublin Airport last year.

The complainant lodged 12,272 complaints during 2021 with DAA at an average rate of 34 cases daily, the airport operator said.

Reports from the individual accounted for 90pc of complaints received by the airport operator about noise from aircraft taking off and landing at Dublin.

It is almost double the 6,227 complaints the same individual filed in 2020. This is even though the total number of aircraft movements at Dublin Airport last year was only up around 10pc to almost 91,000 as air traffic continued to be affected by reduced international travel caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.

The unidentified complainant, who is understood to live in Ongar, north-west Dublin, has been largely responsible for a dramatic increase in complaints filed with DAA since 2019.

Before that DAA was receiving around 1,500 noise complaints a year, but last year’s total was 13,569. However, the figure would have been just 1,296 if cases filed by the serial complainant were excluded.

As the number of flights has returned to near pre-pandemic levels in 2022, the same individual has already filed a total of 5,276 complaints in the first three months of this year — a daily average of 59 cases — out of a total of 5,573 logged by DAA.

However, the number of individuals who lodged complaints with DAA last year was just 191 — up from 128 in 2020.

Most complaints are filed by residents living near Dublin Airport and on flight paths of aircraft, particularly Portmarnock, Swords, the Ward and St Margaret’s.

However, complaints have been lodged from residents on the southside of the city including Blackrock, Dún Laoghaire, Ballybrack, Killiney and Sallynoggin, as well as Dunboyne, Co Meath.

DAA’s noise and flight-track monitoring system, which uses seven fixed noise-monitoring terminals around north Dublin, shows approximately 97pc of commercial flights using Dublin Airport adhered to designated flight paths on approach and take-off last year.

The Indo Daily: Terminal turmoil — What you need to know about Dublin Airport delays and how to beat the queues

Under a noise management plan, aircraft taking off from Dublin Airport should adhere to a “noise preferential route” — a flight path designed to avoid overflight of built-up areas where possible — and maintain a straight course for five nautical miles or reach an altitude of 3,000ft before commencing a turn.

A terminal located at Bay Lane to monitor departing flights from the main runway recorded 160 occasions in the first half of 2021 when aircraft noise reached 80 decibels.

Most complaints are about noise from aircraft using Dublin Airport at night-time. These also relate to departing aircraft taking off from the main runway in a westerly direction.

A DAA spokesperson declined to comment on the large volume of complaints filed by a single individual, but said the airport operators were committed to working with the communities around the airport on issues such as aircraft noise.

The spokesperson said aircraft noise was the joint responsibility of Dublin Airport, the Irish Aviation Authority and the airlines using the airport.

DAA said it responded to each individual complainant about issues raised.

The spokesperson said DAA had introduced an online system called Webtrak so members of the public could get details on flight paths and noise levels from aircraft using Dublin Airport

“The system provides information on flight origin, destination, aircraft type, flight path and noise level registered on the airport’s noise-monitoring terminals,” he added.

DAA said the system also provided a simplified way for individuals to submit noise complaints.

The newly established Aircraft Noise Competent Authority (ANCA) has recommended the introduction of a noise quota scheme for night-time flights at Dublin Airport as part of an application by DAA to amend conditions attached to planning permission for a new runway.

ANCA has also proposed a voluntary sound insulation scheme for all residences that would be exposed to aircraft noise above 55 decibels.

Separately, DAA has introduced a voluntary house purchase scheme for any residence exposed to noise levels in excess of 69 decibels for when the new north runway is operational."
Iceberg lettuce in blond wig outlasts Liz Truss,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/oct/20/iceberg-lettuce-in-blonde-wig-outlasts-liz-truss?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Other,nottheonion,"A wilting 60p iceberg lettuce from Tesco in a blond wig has been crowned the winner of a bizarre competition after outlasting Liz Truss’s tenuous grip on power.

Seven days ago the Daily Star set up a webcam on the lettuce to see if it would have a longer shelf-life than the prime minister. To add to Truss’s humiliating resignation, the lettuce won.

As Truss made her resignation statement, those viewing the video on YouTube soared to more than 20,000.

When the prime minister confirmed her departure on Thursday lunchtime, a plastic gold crown was placed on the now browning leafy vegetable. The caption changed from “Day Seven: Will Liz Truss outlast his lettuce?” to “The Lettuce Outlasted Liz Truss”. The national anthem was played to mark the lettuce’s triumph, and champagne was poured.

The lettuce was inundated with messages of congratulations, in a chat box beside the video. They included: “Lettuce Rejoice”, “Lettuce being having you”, “Lettuce for PM”, “Lettuce 1 Truss 0”, “Truss sunk by an iceberg”.

The Daily Star lettuce has come out victorious in the battle of the year - to see whether it could outlast Prime Minister Liz Truss in #LizVsLettuce

The Daily Star’s stunt was inspired by the Economist, which earlier this month quipped that Truss’s tenure in Downing Street threatened to be “roughly the shelf-life of a lettuce”.

The lettuce-cam attracted global media attention as a symbol of the rapid disintegration of Truss’s government and the ridicule it faced.

France’s News 24 asked: “What do British Prime Minister Liz Truss’s political mandate and a head of wilted lettuce have in common, you might ask? They both have an expiry date.”

“Now Liz Truss even has to fight a head of lettuce in the fight for her political career,” the German tabloid Bild reported.

The Washington Post said comparing Truss to a lettuce was “the butt of quintessentially British jokes”.

The New York Times noted: “Lettuce can generally stay crisp for about seven to 10 days – though that’s typically the lifespan of refrigerated lettuce, not a head that’s been sitting out on a table and wearing a wig.”

What else could Liz Truss have done in 45 days?

Liz Truss spent only 45 days at 10 Downing Street, which equates to 1,080 hours. Here are some of the things she could have done rather than serve as Britain’s shortest-lived prime minister:"
"49% Of Japanese Companies Have An ""Old Man Who Does Nothing"" According To A Survey",https://japaninsides.com/49-of-japanese-companies-have-an-old-man-who-does-nothing-according-to-a-survey/,nottheonion,"People don’t want their weakest link to become a part of a chain.

This is why people often avoid joining new companies. Some people, however, find the sweet spot where they can do enough not to get fired. This is often to the dismay of their more hardworking colleagues.

To learn more about this phenomenon, consulting company, Shikigaku interviewed 300 employees at over 300 companies and asked them if they knew of any “old guys who don’t work.”

They use the Japanese term ojisan, which implies an age gap between the person speaking and the speaker. Shikigaku surveyed people of age 20 to 39, a wide range that could place “old guys” anywhere above 40’s.

So when these young employees were asked if there was anyone “older who always sat around doing nothing,” about half of them said that there was.

These positive responses led to the following question: What were they doing?

The majority of the answers fall into three options. The most popular said that these do-nothing employees took too many smoking breaks. The second most voted answer says they were just staring into the space. And the third-most voted answers reveal that they spent their time idle chatting. Surprisingly, the most expected response of them just browsing the internet all day came only fourth.

Shikigaku asked respondents their thoughts to help them understand why the older men have chosen to be lazy. The most common theory among respondents (45%) stated that these men simply had no motivation or desire to work.

Other reasons included complaints that companies did not provide enough incentives or a stick to encourage these men to work harder. They recommended that the company should review employees more often and that there are more transparent policies about what grounds for dismissal.

These people are a threat to the workplace, according to 90% of respondents. A whopping 59% said that having these people around the workplace lowers their morale, and 49% of them claim that their workload increases a lot due to these people. 35.3% claim that they were just a burden to the office and a waste of salaries.

A Florida activist wants to mess with Texas and SB 797, the state's controversial new law requiring schools to display do nated “In God We Trust” posters.Chaz Stevens, an advocate for the separation of church and state, is donating signs to Lone Star State public schools with ""In God We Trust"" written in Arabic. Best known for erecting Festivus poles in the Florida State Capitol to counter nativity scenes, Stevens' poster campaign is intended to tweak Texas' Republican leaders for requiring public schools to display posters emblazoned with the motto. According to S.B. 797 , the posters must have the phrase ""In God We Trust"" accompanied by an American flag directly underneath the words in the center of the sign. A Texas flag must also appear somewhere on the banner, and the posters must be donated by outside organizations not receiving tax-dollar funding.However, the law doesn't specify the language the motto must be printed in, Stevens argues.According to a blog posted on OnlySky Media , Stevens has already placed orders for 50 signs written in Arabic and has contacted Carroll Senior High School in the North Texas suburb of Southlake about donating one of the signs to the school.Several Carroll ISD schools received posters donated by Patriot Mobile, a Christian conservative wireless phone provider, last week, according to the Dallas Morning News Those interested in joining Stevens' crusade against S.B. 797 can donate to his GoFundMe dubbed ""Messing with Texas.""

"Miami spent $350,000 on new park lights. The park closes at sundown",https://www.wlrn.org/news/2022-03-17/miami-spent-350-000-on-new-park-lights-the-park-closes-at-sundown,nottheonion,"A totally revamped park on the shores of Biscayne Bay recently reopened to the public. The new amenities include a rebuilt sea wall, a path along the waterfront and dozens of native trees to replace the 69 invasive Australian pines that were chopped down.

But from the view of the Rickenbacker Causeway, the most notable new feature is the 53 new solar-powered light poles that fully illuminate the park after dark.

There’s just one problem: The park still closes at sunset. The public cannot benefit from the new lights.

WLRN is committed to providing South Florida with trusted news and information. As the pandemic continues, our mission is as vital as ever. Your support makes it possible. Please donate today. Thank you.

According to bid documents and cost estimates obtained by WLRN, more than $350,000 was invested in the new “safety lighting” at the public park.

“It’s so that the homeless don’t use it,” suggested Albert Gomez, the co-founder of the Miami Climate Alliance, a group focused on climate change policy. “Police officers like to patrol and not get out of the car and not have to go through the park in the dark with flashlights. They would prefer to have lights and be able to spot the homeless people and go and get them out.”

He cited a well-known “ hostile architecture ” approach that uses strategic lighting to prevent loitering or gatherings of residents experiencing homelessness.

A total of $2.6 million for the park project was paid for by the $400 Miami Forever Bond passed by city of Miami voters in 2017. The rest of the money for the $4.9 million project came from a grant from the Florida Inland Navigation District, according to city records. The grant money went towards rebuilding the sea wall.

Much of the money from the bond was meant to be earmarked for resilience projects and to beef up infrastructure to combat the creeping realities of sea level rise. The park project, officially called the “Alice Wainwright Park Seawall and Resiliency” project, is one of the first batch of bond projects to be partially completed.

“Taking homeless people’s ability to sleep in a park, how is that adding to resiliency?” asked Gomez.

As a former member of Miami’s Sea Level Rise Committee, Gomez played a major role in getting the resiliency bond onto the ballot, which was passed by Miami voters in 2017. Yet even at the time, Gomez said he worried the money would be used for projects that had little if anything to do with resiliency or battling the creeping impacts of sea level rise and climate change.

He pushed the city to create specific “selection criteria” that would apply a range of factors to make sure that the money was spent on tackling resiliency. In the end the city came up with a simple checklist that would determine how money is spent.

“The way they qualified it is because they are solar lights. Therefore by deploying solar lights, in air quotes, you meet the checkbox in their checklist for meeting the resiliency criteria,” said Gomez. “It’s a perfect example of how when you don’t have a selection criteria, things can get ‘ridered’ onto existing renovation projects that aren't really truly resilient.”

He fears that if things go on unchanged, millions of dollars meant to combat the impacts of climate change and sea level rise will be used to fund projects that would be better considered maintenance or non-resilient capital improvement projects. That money should come from the general budget, not from the Miami Forever Bond, he argued.

Gomez points to other ongoing projects funded by the bond that go towards renovating boat ramps, roofing repairs and road projects as examples.

The City of Miami did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this story.

Daniel Rivero / WLRN The new solar lights have extended the open hours of the park.

The Miami Forever Bond has a Citizens’ Oversight Board , which is able to make recommendations and audit how money is spent. However, the board has met infrequently since it was created.

In the latest oversight board meeting, held in December, board members started to ask more pointed questions about requiring stricter resiliency criteria, according to minutes of the meeting.

The board has yet to meet so far in 2022, but a meeting is scheduled for March 30.

Some of the most frequent visitors of Alice Wainwright Park, a group of men experiencing homelessness, were skeptical of the resiliency project from the start.

The sea wall clearly needed repair, said Alberto Lopez, but once the project got started the Australian pine trees were cut down. The little shelters for people to have barbecues on the bay were destroyed, and have not yet been replaced. Gazebos should be coming in the second phase of the project, according to city plans .

“Destroy what’s there, take out all the plants and then put in some new plants. Keep the money moving,” said Lopez. “Come on, man, leave the city how it is. Don’t keep messing with it.”

When told the estimate of how much the new solar lights cost, he was incredulous.

“It’s a robbery, acere,” he said.

His friend Jose Villamonte Fundora said he has been coming to the park for decades. He remembered that Madonna once brought him and his friends pizza when she lived at a bayfront home a few doors down. “Out of the goodness of her heart,” he said.

Villamonte Fundora called the resiliency project a “swindle” that did little to improve the park for residents. He complained that a large section was previously an open field where children would play soccer and throw football in front of the bay, and has now been interplanted with trees and a web of gravel footpaths.

In the project plans, the city said the new native landscaping and new path system was meant to improve drainage and to make the park better able to withstand the impacts of sea level rise.

Albert Gomez continues to push the City of Miami to develop selection criteria for how resiliency money is spent to make sure the maximum amount goes towards its intended purpose, and not line items that are only tangentially related to resiliency goals.

The proposed criteria would require an assessment of the location of the project, how many people the project will impact, and what specific resilience goal the money is alleviating.

“What they’re doing is passing along projects that are not resilient and classifying them as resilient, and frankly most of those should be coming from the general fund, not from the bond,” said Gomez. “Will it make it harder for Capital Improvements to green light projects if they implement a selection criteria? Yeah, because it’s going to require those projects to truly be resilient.”

"Ubisoft exec defends NFTs, saying players ‘don’t get it’",https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-exec-defends-nfts-saying-players-dont-get-it/,nottheonion,"A Ubisoft executive has said the company will proceed with its plans to implement non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in its games, claiming players just “don’t get it”.

In an interview with Australian financial comparison site Finder, Ubisoft’s Strategic Innovations Lab VP Nicolas Pouard defended the publisher’s plans to add NFTs to its games, despite huge player backlash.

“Well, it was a reaction we were expecting,” Pouard said of the large negative response to its Quartz NFT system. “We know it’s not an easy concept to grasp.

“But Quartz is really just a first step that should lead to something bigger. Something that will be more easily understood by our players.”

Ubisoft Quartz - announce trailer

Pouard continued to imply throughout the interview that the player backlash was due to their inability to understand the benefits of NFTs, rather than any legitimate concerns about the scheme.

“I think gamers don’t get what a digital secondary market can bring to them,” Pouard said. “For now, because of the current situation and context of NFTs, gamers really believe it’s first destroying the planet, and second just a tool for speculation.

“But what we [at Ubisoft] are seeing first is the end game. The end game is about giving players the opportunity to resell their items once they’re finished with them or they’re finished playing the game itself.

“So, it’s really, for them. It’s really beneficial. But they don’t get it for now.”

When asked about the news that Stalker 2 developer GSC Game World had u-turned on its NFT plans following player backlash, Pouard again put it down to a lack of player comprehension.

“It’s saddening to see there’s still some resistance based on misunderstanding,” he said. “But I’m not sure we can really compare what Stalker 2 was trying to do with what we are trying to achieve with Quartz. It’s not the same use-case to the players, I would say.”

Despite the attempt to portray the plans in a positive light, a report last month by Kotaku claimed that a number of Ubisoft developers are extremely unhappy with the company’s decision to add NFTs to its game.

The site claimed to have been shown messages posted on Ubisoft’s internal social media hub, MANA, in which staff were seen showing confusion and disappointment over the announcement of the Ubisoft Quartz platform.

One developer confused by the plans reportedly wrote: “I still don’t really understand the ‘problem’ being solved here. Is it really worth the (extremely) negative publicity this will cause?”

Another staff member not in favour of the platform added: “How can you look at private property, speculation, artificial scarcity, and egoism, then say ‘yes, this is good, I want that, let’s put it in art’?”

Numerous game companies have already started selling digital items as NFTs, including Konami and Atari, though this has attracted criticism from some due to the format’s high carbon footprint and what many perceive to be cynical implementation.

Square Enix was the most recent high-profile games publisher to express its enthusiasm for the technology trends.

In a New Year letter published during the holiday break, president Yosuke Matsuda committed to making blockchain and NFT games a part of its games portfolio.

Earlier this month Sega registered a trademark for ‘Sega NFT’, while prolific video games voice actor Troy Baker announced that he was teaming up with Voiceverse NFT, which claims it will let people buy AI voices as NFTs.

Despite the apparent surge in NFT schemes, a recent GDC survey of over 2700 game developers showed that 70% have no interest in implementing NFTs in their games."
Boris Johnson says 'nobody told me' No 10 lockdown garden party was against the rules,https://news.sky.com/story/boris-johnson-says-nobody-told-me-no-10-lockdown-garden-party-was-against-the-rules-12519115,nottheonion,"Boris Johnson has said ""nobody told me"" the Number 10 garden party during lockdown was ""against the rules"", but two members of the 2019 intake of Conservative MPs have told Sky News more letters of no confidence in the prime minister are being prepared for submission.

The prime minister said he ""humbly apologises"" to people for ""misjudgements"" that were made, but he would not have gone ahead with the event, to which 100 people were invited, on 20 May 2020 if he thought it broke the rules.

He said: ""I'm saying categorically that nobody told me, nobody said this was something that was against the rules, doing something that wasn't a work event because frankly, I can't imagine why it would have gone ahead, or it would have been allowed to go ahead if it was against the rules.""

Sunak says 'of course' he believes PM - partygate latest

Mr Johnson's latest comments come following claims from his former top adviser Dominic Cummings that the prime minister knew in advance about the Downing Street drinks party - which Number 10 has denied.

Mr Cummings will be interviewed as part of an investigation into parties and gatherings at Downing Street during coronavirus restrictions.

PM's interview likened to a 'bad amateur dramatics performance'

The pressure on the PM shows no signs of abating, however, with one Conservative MP telling Sky News that things are ""nearly there"" in terms of reaching the required 54 letters to trigger a vote of no-confidence in his leadership.

They described the past weekend as a ""turning point"" and said they give the PM ""a week"" before he is gone.

Another told political correspondent Joe Pike that the PM looked ""absolutely beaten"" in his latest interview, describing his performance as ""awful"" and like a ""bad amateur dramatics performance"".

Meanwhile, deputy political editor Sam Coates has been told that ""lots of conversations"" are happening between 2019 intake Tory MPs and there is a ""resolve"" among them that Mr Johnson should go.

One 2019 MP said around 20 letters were being written, with the PM in parliament on Tuesday night trying to win the rebels around.

""We are certainly nearly there,"" one source told Sky News.

The PM has denied having prior knowledge of the May 2020 party.

Mr Johnson said: ""My memory is going out into the garden for about 25 minutes, which I implicitly thought was a work event, and talking to staff, thanking staff.

""I then went back to my office and continued my work.

""I carry full responsibility for what took place, nobody said to me 'this is an event that's against the rules, in breach of what we're asking everybody else to do'.""

He added that is exactly what he has told the inquiry into several Downing Street lockdown events by top civil servant Sue Gray, who is due to report back next week.

PM: 'I should have told people to go back indoors'

Mr Johnson admitted on reflection he ""should have looked around and told people to go back indoors"" after realising it was not a work event.

He said he wanted to ""repeat my apologies for misjudgements I've made"" after saying sorry in the House of Commons last week following mounting pressure over attending the event.

Asked about two parties alleged to have taken place on the eve of Prince Philip's funeral, Mr Johnson looked down and appeared distressed.

Analysis: PM knows how much trouble he's in Beth Rigby Political editor @BethRigby Boris Johnson looked beaten, distressed and out of options. His tone was intended to reiterate that humble apology which he says he gave in the House of Commons last week. But when we drove into the detail about what he did or didn't know, it was uncomfortable. He was clear he had no recollection of Dominic Cummings verbally warning him about the event on 20 May going ahead, or that he was warned that it could be in breach of guidelines. It will be up to Sue Gray to uncover the truth. But where is he right now? It's clear the prime minister is feeling the pressure and clearly understands the trouble he is in. For me, the most striking moment of the interview was when I asked him about those parties held on the night before the funeral of Prince Philip. He looked visibility upset about that. He hung his head and said he deeply and bitterly regretted that that happened. And he apologised to the Queen and to the country. I asked him repeatedly if it emerges that he misled parliament whether he would resign? He didn't rule it out. He said he would wait for the Sue Gray report. He was dodging the question, but it won't go away - and even then there's another question: can this PM hold on, or does his party think it's time to go? That is a very, very precarious position from him to be in.

""I deeply and bitterly regret that happened, I can only renew my apology to Her Majesty and to apologise for misjudgements made and for which I take full responsibility,"" he said.

Mr Cummings yesterday claimed Mr Johnson gave the May 2020 garden party the go-ahead so lied to parliament when he said he did not know, but the PM denied this.

Mr Johnson also said he only saw the email invite for the event from his right-hand man Martin Reynolds the other day, when it was revealed to the media.

The PM is facing calls for his resignation, including from some of his own MPs, over the issue but has said the investigation into the parties must be allowed ""space"" to be concluded.

Labour says PM 'clearly knows it's end of the road'

Angela Rayner, Labour's deputy leader, reacting to the PM's interview, said he ""clearly knows it's the end of the road"".

""He's the prime minister, he set the rules, he didn't need anyone to tell him that the party he attended broke them,"" she said.

""If he had any respect for the British public, he would do the decent thing and resign.""

Five things we learned from Johnson interview Joe Pike Political correspondent @joepike His core defence is now ""nobody told me"" - the PM argues his team did not tell him Number 10 garden party was against the rules.

The PM specifically denied Dominic Cummings's claim that he lied.

The PM confirmed he personally apologised to the Queen for the raucous Number 10 parties held the night before her husband's funeral.

Mr Johnson also confirmed he has spoken to senior civil servant Sue Gray as part of her investigation into rule-breaking parties.

The prime minister did not rule out resigning.

Senior Tories leave open idea PM would have to resign if code breached

Senior cabinet members have said they believe Mr Johnson, but both Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab and Chancellor Rishi Sunak pointed out the ministerial code ""is clear on these matters"".

The code says: ""It is of paramount importance that ministers give accurate and truthful information to parliament, correcting any inadvertent error at the earliest opportunity.

""Ministers who knowingly mislead parliament will be expected to offer their resignation to the prime minister.""

Mr Sunak, when asked if he supported the PM unequivocally, got up and left without answering.

Before that, asked if he believed the PM, he said: ""Of course I do, the prime minister set out his understanding of this matter in parliament last week and I'd refer you to his words.

""As you know, Sue Gray is conducting an enquiry into this matter and I fully support the prime minister's request for patience while that inquiry concludes.""

The chancellor said he would not ""get into hypotheticals"" following Mr Cummings' claim Mr Johnson lied to parliament.

""The ministerial code is clear on these matters,"" he added.

And Mr Raab told the BBC if a minister lies and it is deliberate it is ""normally"" a resigning matter, under the ministerial code.

Mr Johnson's spokesman also said the code ""is very clear when it comes to knowingly misleading the House"" and the PM ""abides by that, and we fully support it"".

Asked if the PM would resign if he misled parliament, the spokesman said: ""It's important not to jump ahead.""

He also denied Mr Johnson had ever lied to parliament."
Texas says supply chain issues have limited the number of voter registration forms it can give out,https://www.kut.org/politics/2022-01-18/texas-says-supply-chain-issues-have-limited-the-number-of-voter-registration-forms-it-can-give-out,nottheonion,"Lee esta historia en español.

The Texas Secretary of State’s office is having more trouble than usual getting enough voter registration cards to groups who help Texans register to vote.

Sam Taylor, assistant secretary of state for communications, said supply chain issues have made it harder and more expensive to get paper, which means the Secretary of State's office will be giving out fewer voter registration forms to groups ahead of elections this year.

“We are limited in what we can supply this year, because of the paper shortage and the cost constraints due to the price of paper and the supply of paper,” he said.

Grace Chimene, the president of the League of Women Voters of Texas, said it is not unusual for the Secretary of State to not have enough forms to fill all the requests it gets from groups like hers ahead of elections. This particular shortage, however, is affecting an important part of her group’s work: registering thousands of newly naturalized citizens.

Chimene said in previous years, her group, which has chapters across the state, has been able to get enough forms to pass out at naturalization ceremonies. Often, she said, the group partners with the state to give out several thousand forms at each ceremony.

“The League in Houston registers about 30,000 new citizens every year through these ceremonies in the past,” Chimene said.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a mix of in-person and remote ceremonies. Chimene said her group has either been handing out voter registration materials at in-person events or they’ve been sending out packets they put together ahead of time to those new citizens.

Either way, the League and their volunteers often ask for thousands of voter registration forms ahead of these ceremonies.

“It’s a really important job that we do and we value it, and I think the new citizens value it also,"" Chimene said.

Taylor said the Secretary of State’s office has been forced to limit each group to 1,000 to 2,000 registration forms per request. He said this shortage is coming at a time when many groups are seeking out new voter registration forms because of a change in Texas’ voter registration laws created under Senate Bill 1, a controversial voting law that went into effect last month.

“The voter registration application changed this year for one reason: It’s because the legislature decided to increase the penalty for illegal voter registration from a class B misdemeanor to a class A misdemeanor,” he said.

Previously, Taylor said that change had to be reflected on registration applications in order for them to be approved. But, after this story was published Tuesday, he clarified that's not necessarily the case.

“While we have made clear to officials and groups that they should not be distributing the old version of the Voter Registration form, county voter registrars may accept completed voter registration applications on the old form, so long as the application is otherwise valid,"" Taylor said in a statement Tuesday. ""In other words, using last year’s form in and of itself is not fatal to the voter’s registration application.”

Chimene said all these constraints present serious issues for her group as they try to get voter registration materials together ahead of these large naturalization ceremonies.

“We are treating all organizations that request these the same,” Taylor said. “We are trying to fulfill these requests as fast we can. But the fact is we simply don’t have the supply to honor every single request for free applications.”

According to Chimene, this is one of the pitfalls of Texas being among the few states in the country that does not have online voter registration. Supply chain issues are not as big of a problem when you can just direct someone to a website.

She’s also worried about the message this sends to newly naturalized citizens, which she said have been under particular scrutiny by the Secretary of State’s office recently. Chimene said the League is worried that newly naturalized, eligible voters are being targeted by the state's latest focus on potential non-citizen voters.

“We are concerned about it, and we are looking into it,” Chimene said. “It just sort all goes together: not providing the service they are supposed be providing to the citizens of Texas.”

Chimene said the Secretary of State’s office has told the League to seek out donations instead of relying on the state for voter registration forms. She said she “didn’t appreciate” this considering the fact her group is a non-partisan nonprofit. However, Chimene said, her group will try and do what it can.

“We will ask our supporters, we will ask our friends and our neighbors,” she said. “And find out if we could have somebody donate to get this done.”

Update: This story has been updated with a clarification from the Texas Secretary of State's office to say county voter registrars can accept completed voter registration applications on the old forms."

GEICO to pay $5.2M to woman who says she caught STD in former partner’s car,https://www.pilotonline.com/nation-world/vp-nw-std-car-geico-insurance-20220608-jh2o27ahybcyxck3ol66wm2qx4-story.html,nottheonion,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. — The Missouri Court of Appeals has affirmed that an insurance company must pay a $5.2 million settlement granted to a Jackson County woman who claimed she unwittingly caught a sexually transmitted disease from her former romantic partner in his car.

In an opinion issued Tuesday, a three-judge panel found that the judgment entered against GEICO General Insurance Company through earlier arbitration proceedings was valid.

The insurance companies sought to undo the action, claiming errors were made in Jackson County Circuit Court and the settlement agreement was not done in line with Missouri law.

According to court papers, the woman, identified in court records only as M.O., notified GEICO in February 2021 of her intention to seek monetary damages, alleging she contracted HPV, the human papillomavirus, from an insured member in his automobile.

She contended the man caused her to be infected with the STD despite being aware of his condition and the risks of unprotected sex. The insurance company declined the settlement, sending the case to arbitration.

In May 2021, the arbitrator found that the man and woman had sex inside his vehicle that “directly caused, or directly contributed to cause” the HPV infection.

The man was found liable for not disclosing his infection status and the woman was awarded $5.2 million for damages and injuries to be paid by GEICO.

The insurance company filed motions seeking a new hearing of the evidence and for the award to be tossed out, saying the judgment violated the company’s rights to due process and the arbitration agreement was unenforceable.

The company appealed after those requests were denied. The three-judge panel tasked with reviewing the case found that the lower court did not make a mistake by denying the company’s motions, saying GEICO did not have a right to “relitigate those issues” once damages had been determined and a judgment was entered.

Judge Tom Chapman concurred in a separate opinion, though, saying he believes GEICO was offered “no meaningful opportunity to participate” in the lawsuit and existing law “relegat(es) the insurer to the status of a bystander.”

RICHMOND, Vt. (AP) — Residents of a small community in Vermont were blindsided last month by news that one official in their water department quietly lowered fluoride levels nearly four years ago, giving rise to worries about their children’s dental health and transparent government — and highlighting the enduring misinformation around water fluoridation.

Katie Mather, who lives in Richmond, a town of about 4,100 in northwestern Vermont, said at a water commission meeting this week that her dentist recently found her two kids’ first cavities. She acknowledged they eat a lot of sugar, but noted that her dentist recommended against supplemental fluoride because the town’s water should be doing the trick.

Her dentist “was operating and making professional recommendations based on state standards we all assumed were being met, which they were not,” Mather said. “It’s the fact that we didn’t have the opportunity to give our informed consent that gets to me.”

The addition of fluoride to public drinking water systems has been routine in communities across the United States since the 1940s and 1950s but still doesn’t sit well with some people, and many countries don’t fluoridate water for various reasons, including feasibility.

Critics argue that the health effects of fluoride aren’t fully known and that its addition to municipal water can amount to an unwanted medication; some communities in recent years have ended the practice. In 2015, the U.S. government lowered its recommended amount in drinking water after some children got too much of it, causing white splotches on their teeth.

While such splotches are primarily a cosmetic problem, the American Dental Association notes on its website that fluoride — along with life-giving substances including salt, iron and oxygen — can be toxic in large doses.

But in the recommended amounts, fluoride in water decreases cavities or tooth decay by about 25%, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which reported in 2018 that 73% of the U.S. population was served by water systems with adequate fluoride to protect teeth. So for some people in Richmond, it was a shock to hear their water wasn’t meeting the standard.

Kendall Chamberlin, Richmond’s water and wastewater superintendent, told the Water and Sewer Commission in September that he reduced the fluoride level because of his concerns about changes to its sourcing and the recommended levels.

He said he worries about quality control in the fluoride used in U.S. drinking systems because it comes from China — an assertion that echoes unfounded reports about Chinese fluoride that have circulated online in recent years.

And, he said, he doesn’t think the state’s recommended level of fluoride is warranted right now.

“My duty is to take reasonable care and judgment for the protection of public health, safety and the environment of my customers,” he said, adding that “to err on the side of caution is not a bad position to be in.”

Chamberlin did not respond to an Associated Press email seeking comment.

Two of the three fluoride additives U.S. water systems can use do, in fact, come from China because they have no domestic manufacturers, but all are subject to stringent standards, testing and certification to ensure safety, CDC spokesperson Tracy Boehmer said in an email. Spokespeople for the Vermont Department of Health concurred that all additives must meet those national standards.

Chamberlin’s decision flabbergasted residents and doctors.

“For a single person to unilaterally make the decision that this public health benefit might not be warranted is inappropriate. I think it’s outrageous,” retired Dr. Allen Knowles said at the Sept. 19 meeting. He said he has an 8-month-old granddaughter he thought was getting adequately fluoridated water.

“Fluoride, again, is one of the most successful and important public health measures that has ever been undertaken in this country,” Knowles said. “The reduction in dental disease is just inarguable. You don’t establish safety based on one person’s opinion or one study or this or that.”

Most water naturally contains some fluoride, but typically not enough to prevent cavities.

The mineral was first added to public water in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in 1945. Now it’s commonplace, although more prevalent in some states than others; Oregon, New Jersey and Hawaii have the lowest percentage of residents with fluoridated water, according to the United Health Foundation.

Fluoride is also added to toothpaste and other topical products and is in some foods.

In sparsely populated and largely rural Vermont, 29 of the 465 public water systems voluntarily fluoridate, and just over half of residents served by a public system get fluoridated water, according to the Vermont Department of Health. The state’s standard level is based on federal recommendations.

Towns that fluoridate must maintain levels within the state’s recommendations and submit monthly reports to the state Health Department.

The state’s former fluoride program manager, who retired in 2019, had tried working with Chamberlin and his team in Richmond, “and things would improve for a while, but drop back down again,” Robin Miller, the director of the Office of Oral Health, wrote in an email to the AP.

Miller said she didn’t realize the town’s fluoride number had been consistently low for so long until March this year. After a site visit by the state in April, the levels did not improve, so Miller contacted the Richmond town manager in June, who requested she attend the meeting in September, she said.

At the second meeting Monday, the one at which Katie Mather raised concerns about her children’s teeth, Chamberlin — who doesn’t live in town and appeared online — read a statement of apology.

“Words cannot express how sorry I am for causing this controversy,” he said. “Believe me when I say I have always only had good intentions based on a misunderstanding. I promise I will make sure nothing like this ever happens again.”

A former Richmond employee who worked under Chamberlin pointed out the monthly report is reviewed by the town manager and goes to the state.

“It’s not just one guy doing what he wants. He’s bringing these reports to his boss, who signs them,” said Erik Bailey, now the village manager in Johnson.

Town Manager Josh Arneson said Chamberlin or other staffers always told him levels were acceptable. He said he first heard from the state in June about the consistently low levels.

The commission voted to return the water to full fluoridation. It’s not clear whether anyone could face professional repercussions; personnel issues were discussed in a closed session."
World's most boring person discovered by researchers,https://www.essex.ac.uk/news/2022/03/18/the-most-boring-person-in-the-world-discovered-by-researchers,nottheonion,"The study into the science of boredom has uncovered the jobs, characteristics, and hobbies that are considered a stereotypical snooze.

After examining more than 500 people across five experiments researchers found the blandest jobs are seen as data analysis, accounting, cleaning and banking.

The paper – published in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin – also discovered the dullest hobbies were seen to be religion, watching TV, bird watching and smoking.

Boring people were also perceived to shun large settlements to live in small cities and towns

Led by Dr Wijnand Van Tilburg from the Department of Psychology, the research revealed that stereotypically boring people are generally disliked and avoided due to preconceptions.

And people may expect to be paid a minimum of £35-a-day to spend time with them as recompense.

He launched the study to explore the stigma of perceived boredom and how it can impact on perceptions.

He said: “The irony is studying boredom is actually very interesting and has many real-life impacts.

“This paper shows how persuasive perceptions of boredom are and what an impact this can have on people.

“Perceptions can change but people may not take time to speak to those with ‘boring’ jobs and hobbies, instead choosing to avoid them.

“They don’t get a chance to prove people wrong and break these negative stereotypes.

“The very fact that people choose to avoid them can lead to social ostracization and increase loneliness leading to a really negative impact on their lives.”

The study also showed that being perceived as boring likely conveys low competence and low interpersonal warmth.

Those perceived as boring may thus be at greater risk of harm, addiction and mental health issues.

And despite the negative perception society needs people to perform roles such as accounting and banking.

“It was interesting to me to see the study showed that boring people were not seen as competent,” said Dr Van Tilburg.

“I would have thought that accountants would be seen as boring, but effective and the perfect person to do a good job on your tax return.

“The truth of the matter is people like bankers and accountants are highly capable and have power in society - perhaps we should try not to upset them and stereotype them as boring!”

"Greater Victoria builders say they can’t find workers to build new homes, because they can’t find homes for the workers",https://www.capitaldaily.ca/news/greater-victoria-construction-labour-shortage,nottheonion,"“There’s just no availability, whether to rent or buy. Affordability is a factor too, but availability is the biggest factor,” CEO Chad Bryden said. There just aren’t available homes for rent or purchase, no matter the price.

Even so, companies across the South Island say new job postings are now staying active indefinitely, and where a builder used to receive six resumes a week, now they might see two or three in a month. Contractors bid outrageously high sums for small jobs because they just don’t have the capacity.

There’s a labour shortage in the construction industry, but it’s not for lack of people wanting to work. The number of new workers may even have increased over the past few years, thanks in part to COVID. While other industries like hospitality suffered during the pandemic, construction was an essential service; it slowed for a moment to implement health safety guidelines and then kept on building.

This story is the final instalment of our series on the labour shortage, Pay Check. Click here to see the rest of the stories , which cover healthcare, the marine industry, restaurants, and more.

Call it a bottleneck, a trap, or a vicious cycle, you can’t build new housing without a labour force, and workers can’t come if they have nowhere to live.

Gordon ‘n’ Gordon, another Langford construction company, isn’t typically a developer; they focus more on specialized contracted trades like steel stud framing and drywall installation. Though they do have a couple of proposed developments moving through Langford’s approval process. At a recent council meeting, their proposal for a six-storey residential building was on the agenda. The presentation included a short note saying that part of the building would be reserved to rent out to employees at under-market rates.

Do new workers want to be builders?

Construction and trades have historically been attractive industries for workers. Work is reliable, the pay is generally good, and there’s enough variety in the work—grunt labour on a home renovation all the way to specialized Red Seal trades on major infrastructure—that it can suit anyone. And during the pandemic, though there was a slowdown in new building permits at the beginning, the industry trucked along.

Camosun College’s waitlist of carpentry students grew. Want to sign up to learn the trade? You’ll be waiting for up to two years to get a seat in class.

That has meant not enough people have been brought in to replace the retiring workforce, at a time of record demand for construction.

“It’s not a matter of ‘or,’ it’s ‘and’—our workforce is retiring and we have a high level of work,” said Rory Kulmala, CEO of the Vancouver Island Construction Association. “So even if we add people, we’re doing a record volume of work across Canada. There’s something like 1.5% housing vacancy in Greater Victoria, and at any given time we have 4,000 to 4,500 units in the hopper being built. There are more cranes now than ever on the skyline.”

More workers than ever are needed to work on and beneath those cranes.

In 2016, for the first time, the Capital Regional District surpassed $1 billion worth of building permits. In 2017 it cracked 3,000 permitted residential units. Building permits have almost doubled in the five years since; in 2021 the region approved $1.9 billion, including over 5,000 residential units.

Al van Akker, the chair of architectural trades and an instructor in the Camosun College carpentry program, regularly gets calls from companies looking to expand to the Island that are in need of apprentices.

“They see the opportunity here and want to get in on it,” he said. “But by far the most important resource of a construction company is their employees. So it’s not something I recommend, coming to bid on projects here if you don’t already have the crew.”

Good weather and an abundance of work means it’s not hard to attract workers to Greater Victoria—until you factor in the cost of living. “When the price of a home is five times what you can get in Saskatchewan, they’re thinking maybe it’s not so good after all,” Kulmala said.

The price could deter potential workers—or drive up wages, a silver lining to the hot market according to van Akker. “For many years wages have been, I would say, not going up the same way they should in terms of cost of living increase.” With short supply and high demand, paycheques could increase. Some contractors who are recruited from other provinces for a job will negotiate a live-out allowance into the contract. That can put builders in a bind if they hadn’t factored that extra cost into the bid.

Latent demand, changing labour recruitment

For years, municipalities have been dragging their heels on meeting housing demand. That backlog has caught up with them, leading to this new demand for so much construction, Kulmala thinks.

“This should have been happening 15 years ago. Had we been more active in development… we’d be in a better place now.”

Now there’s a lot of work to catch up on, all squeezing through a narrow pipeline of approvals and public hearings. The province has also pointed to this as a problem. Housing Minister David Eby floated the idea of taking away some approval power from municipalities because they say no too often.

On top of demand and local housing constraints there are three other significant factors acting on the construction labour force: retiring baby boomers, halted immigration, and competition for recruiting young workers to the field.

The baby boomers’ great retirement has been forecast for years, and comes as no surprise. What makes it complicated is that the people retiring have years of experience and are typically in senior-level positions that can’t be filled by new recruits.

“If you have a position that requires 15 years of experience, the only way to fill it is to give 15 years of experience. There’s a problem that’s been developing for years,” van Akker said.

It’s not very hard to recruit entry-level employees. Even at Camosun, enrollment predictably decreases when work is booming, because companies are willing to hire people even if they have no experience. But that doesn’t work for senior positions.

When immigration shut down at the start of the pandemic, it also slowly choked the construction labour force.

“It was a hurdle before, it’s become a wall now,” Kulmala said. “Our local population growth is not enough to meet all industry demands, and not just in construction but every other sector, too.”

As of the 2016 census, immigrants made up over a quarter of BC’s population growth (28%), total employment (30%), and the construction labour force (25%). BC was second only to Ontario, and well above the national average. And last year BC had by far the highest intraprovincial migration in Canada, just over 34,000 people. Most of them came from Alberta and Ontario, which both had net negative migration (17,000 and 11,000 respectively). (Statistics Canada did not include data showing where the 34,000 new British Columbians work.)

Even as immigration opens up again and BC is consistently among the top destinations in Canada, there is some concern that the construction industry is recruiting a smaller share of the newcomers. European newcomers have traditionally been a reliable source of construction workers, according to market research organization BuildForce Canada. But that trend is threatened as fewer Europeans are immigrating to Canada, among higher demand in Europe for construction workers of its own. India, China, and Philippines are where most Canadian immigrants are coming from as of 2018, and data shows they make up a very small percentage of the construction force.

If builders are to supplement labour from a population that likely already has a place to live, the place to look is young people entering the job market. The Victoria Residential Builders’ Association executive director Casey Edge went so far as to say the shortage could be solved if post-secondary institutions would get on board. Edge has tried to promote practical skills electives at the University of Victoria, but so far it hasn’t said yes. He’d love to see a general arts student take a carpentry course as an elective. It would provide the student with exposure to the industry, and produce more well-rounded graduates from the university, he argues. He thinks a lot of young people don’t realize how interesting construction is. Practical exposure could make some students realize the work appeals to them.

“Houses are being built to a very high level of technicality now, it’s not just simple framing. It’s a very interesting field, but the problem is we’re not providing the opportunity at a younger age,” he said. “We could address these shortages, quite honestly, if the post-secondary institutions got out of the Dark Ages. People are stuck in preconceived notions of what a carpenter is and what a university student is.”

Kulmala agrees there’s an opportunity to recruit more students. He sees it as competition with other sectors, namely computers and technology

“There is a lot of competition for workers. Sectors like IT are really aggressive in trying to find people, and it’s where our young people are being focused now. The internet is so central to who they are and how they work, that they can easily see themselves in that field,” he said. “We’re missing an opportunity to motivate young people to pursue the trades.”

Between retiring construction workers, the incredible amount of work on the South Island, and the record-breaking housing shortage, there is no immediate relief in sight for builders trying to hire. But slowing down isn’t a good option either, Kulmala said. We need more workers to build the needed housing—but then they fill the housing, and more people move here and it’s still not enough.

“It’s a vicious circle,” Kulmala admitted. “Development will happen at the rate it can occur, but you’re never going to be able to build cheaper than you are today. Deferring isn’t the right decision because even though it’s more now, it’s going to be more later too.”

"Florida’s education department rejects math textbooks, saying some had critical race theory",https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/education/fl-ne-fldoe-rejected-math-textbooks-20220415-ofey4n3fkfc7jf5tf7lwxvz7de-story.html,nottheonion,"Even math textbooks can’t measure up to Florida’s strict new education standards.

The Florida Department of Education says it has found that many math textbooks submitted by publishers contained “prohibited topics” — such as references to critical race theory, the legal framework taught only in graduate school and college-level law courses.

Out of 132 submitted textbooks, the education department approved only 78 of them, and rejected more than ever before, according to a news release. It rejected 54, including several it said had critical race theory and other prohibited subjects.

“Reasons for rejecting textbooks included references to Critical Race Theory (CRT), inclusions of Common Core, and the unsolicited addition of Social Emotional Learning (SEL) in mathematics,” the state’s news release stated. “The highest number of books rejected were for grade levels K-5, where an alarming 71 percent were not appropriately aligned with Florida standards or included prohibited topics and unsolicited strategies.”

The education department didn’t provide an example of critical race theory in the rejected textbooks, instead sending a list of two documents that did not contain specific examples.

[ RELATED: Normally a master of messaging, Ron DeSantis was outmaneuvered by the three-word catchphrase ‘Don’t Say Gay’ ]

Critical race theory, first proposed by legal scholars, says racism is embedded in the country’s institutions. Historically, the theory has been a law or graduate school subject and not one taught in public schools.

But DeSantis and other Republicans rallying against it claim, without evidence, that its tenets have seeped into K-12 classrooms with the aim to make white children feel guilty and to teach children to hate the United States.

The education department said it proactively informed publishers last summer that textbooks must align with the state’s new standards.

“It is unfortunate that several publishers, especially at the elementary school grade levels, have ignored this clear communication and have attempted to slip rebranded instructional materials based on Common Core Standards into Florida’s classrooms, while others have included prohibited and divisive concepts such as the tenants of CRT or other unsolicited strategies of indoctrination — despite FDOE’s prior notification,” the news release states.

Publishers can appeal any non-adoption decision, the education department wrote in the news release. Or they can revise their submitted bids to meet Florida’s bid specifications, the education department added.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has openly accused public schools of “indoctrinating” students, applauded the measure in a prepared statement. “It seems that some publishers attempted to slap a coat of paint on an old house built on the foundation of Common Core, and indoctrinating concepts like race essentialism,” the statement said.

DeSantis has stressed the importance of teaching students basic subjects in school while defending controversial bills such as the Stop W.O.K.E. Act and Parental Rights in Education, which critics nicknamed the ‘don’t say gay or trans’ bill.

“At the end of the day, you know, my goal is to educate kids on the subjects — math, reading, science — all the things that are so important,” DeSantis said at a recent news conference, adding that he doesn’t want schools to be a “playground” for ideological disputes, such as the existence of transgender people.

[ RELATED: ‘Don’t say gay’: Five things to know as controversial bill becomes Florida law ]

The state’s move troubled Broward School Board member Sarah Leonardi, a frequent critic of the DeSantis administration.

The Department of Education is “heading in a direction where if any text is inclusive of the diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds that make up our state they’re considering it ‘indoctrination’ and CRT,” she said.

“It’s disturbing, borderline authoritarian, and definitely censorship,” she said. “Notably, it denies the existence of much of our student population. If state leadership made decisions with children in mind, they wouldn’t be engaging in these fallacious culture wars at all.”

Drake defends his short private jet flights – by saying plane was empty,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/29/drake-defends-short-private-jet-flights,nottheonion,"Drake, the rapper, has attempted to defend his use of a large private plane for a series of flights that lasted less than 20 minutes – by revealing that the aircraft was being moved to a storage location with no passengers on board.

The Canadian music star and several other celebrities, including the socialite and business owner Kylie Jenner, have recently been attacked online for using their private jets for short journeys that could easily be undertaken by car or public transport.

Over the past six weeks, Drake’s personal Boeing 767 has taken a seven-minute flight, a 12-minute flight and a 14-minute flight, all between Toronto and nearby Hamilton.

The 14-minute trip burned through 426 gallons of fuel and caused four tons of carbon emissions, which is the same as the total annual carbon footprint of an average person, according to Celebrity Jets, an automated Twitter account that tracks the private flights of the rich and famous.

Responding on Instagram to criticism of these flights, Drake wrote: “This is just them moving planes to whatever airport they are being stored at for anyone who was interested in the logistics … nobody takes that flight.”

While several of Drake’s fans responded with support, arguing that celebrities often move their planes for convenience, others pointed out the pollution from the flight was even more pointless given it didn’t transport anybody.

One reply to Drake stated: “OK but that’s worse, you don’t see how that’s worse?”

Private jets contribute in a relatively small but significant way to the climate crisis, emitting more than 33m tonnes of greenhouse gases, more than the country of Denmark, each year.

Because they carry so few people they are five to 14 times more polluting than commercial planes, per passenger, and 50 times more polluting than trains, researchers have found.

Drake’s empty flights will have been even more carbon intensive, given the lack of people on board.

“Drake’s living in his own meme if he thinks an empty private jet flight is better than a wasteful one with a celebrity on board,” said Scott Hochberg, a transportation attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity.

“This is a prime example of wasteful carbon emissions leading to even more wasteful carbon emissions. These egregious flights add climate-heating pollution all along their journey, from taxiing on the runway to the ground vehicles that service the aircraft.

“Ultra-short, non-essential flying only multiplies the journey’s climate impacts and we hope celebrities will wake up to the damaging impact of their frivolous flying.”

Drake’s climate impact is larger than many other celebrities with private jets because of the enormous size of his personal aircraft. The $185m Boeing 767, which has been called “Air Drake”, typically seats hundreds of people for commercial flights but has been modified to the rapper’s own tastes.

Drake proudly showed off the revamping of his jet in a video posted online three years ago, in which the aircraft is shown with leather armchairs, luxury bathrooms and a full kitchen."
"Wells Fargo staged 'fake' job interviews for Black people, women in quest for diversity",https://www.wral.com/at-wells-fargo-a-quest-to-increase-diversity-leads-to-fake-job-interviews/20290264/,nottheonion,"Joe Bruno, a former executive in the wealth management division of Wells Fargo, had long been troubled by the way his unit handled certain job interviews.

For many open positions, employees would interview a “diverse” candidate — the bank’s term for a woman or person of color — in keeping with the bank’s yearslong informal policy. But Bruno noticed that often, the so-called diverse candidate would be interviewed for a job that had already been promised to someone else.

He complained to his bosses. They dismissed his claims. In August, Bruno, 58, was fired. In an interview, he said Wells Fargo retaliated against him for telling his superiors that the “fake interviews” were “inappropriate, morally wrong, ethically wrong.”

Wells Fargo said Bruno was dismissed for retaliating against a fellow employee.

Bruno is one of seven current and former Wells Fargo employees who said they were instructed by their direct bosses or human resources managers in the bank’s wealth management unit to interview “diverse” candidates — even though the decision had already been made to give the job to another candidate. Five others said they were aware of the practice, or helped to arrange it.

The interviews, they said, seemed to be more about helping Wells Fargo record its diversity efforts on paper — partly in anticipation of possible regulatory audits — rather than hiring more women or people of color. All but three spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were afraid of losing their jobs at Wells Fargo or their new employers.

In an emailed statement, Raschelle Burton, a Wells Fargo spokesperson, said the bank expected all employees to follow its hiring policies and guidelines, which are communicated across the firm. “To the extent that individual employees are engaging in the behavior as described by The New York Times, we do not tolerate it,” Burton said.

Burton said she was aware that informal directives about hiring diverse candidates had long circulated inside the bank. But those rules were from an earlier era that the bank’s current leaders had nothing to do with, she added. Most of Wells Fargo’s top management turned over in 2020 after a scandal involving the creation of fraudulent accounts damaged the bank’s reputation and led to more than $4.5 billion in fines.

The internal confusion around Wells Fargo’s diversity policies highlights how even the noblest goals can end up getting warped as they make their way from idea to practice, ultimately hurting the very people they were meant to help.

Two years ago, in light of the national reckoning on race that followed the murder of George Floyd, Wells Fargo was among the companies that pledged to increase diversity.

In a June 2020 memo to employees, Charles W. Scharf, who became CEO of Wells Fargo the year before, pledged to consider a wider array of candidates for jobs at the bank but added that the bank struggled to find qualified Black candidates. He later apologized for the comment when the memo became public in September.

After Scharf’s directive, Wells Fargo adopted a formal policy in requiring that a diverse slate of candidates would have to be interviewed for all open jobs paying more than $100,000 a year.

That August, Wells Fargo paid nearly $8 million to settle a claim by the Department of Labor that it had discriminated against more than 30,000 Black job applicants for positions in banking, sales and support roles.

Wells Fargo had already been trying to increase diversity. In 2013, a group of Black financial advisers at Wells Fargo sued the bank for racial discrimination, saying they were corralled into poor neighborhoods and kept away from opportunities to win new clients and partner with white financial advisers.

The bank settled the case in 2017. Wells Fargo paid nearly $36 million to about 320 members of the class-action lawsuit and pledged to “take actions designed to enhance opportunities for employment, earnings, and advancement of African American financial advisers and financial adviser trainees.”

As the lawsuit progressed, Wells Fargo began requiring that at least one woman or person of color needed to be interviewed for each open job, Burton said. She added that the policy was not written down and was only for certain senior positions. The policy was similar to the NFL’s Rooney Rule, named for Dan Rooney, a former owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers. The rule was devised after researchers demonstrated to league officials that Black coaches were being shut out of job opportunities. It required the league to interview at least one nonwhite candidate for senior positions such as head coach and general manager. Earlier this year, the NFL was sued by Black coaches, who claimed they were subject to “sham” interviews.

“Well-intentioned people created these initiatives, but when they hit the ground, the energy was devoted not to implementing them but finding a way to get around them,” said Linda Friedman, the lawyer for the Black financial advisers involved in 2017 Wells Fargo settlement.

Bruno joined Wells Fargo in 2000 and worked his way up to market leader for Wells Fargo Advisors in Jacksonville, Florida. He oversaw 14 branches of the bank’s wealth management operation. He saw himself as a champion of diversity.

Bruno was mainly responsible for filling two categories of jobs — financial advisers and financial consultants, who work alongside advisers. He said that he was often told to conduct interviews with Black candidates for the financial consultant positions, which were lower-paying jobs. In most such cases, Wells had no intention of hiring those people because either he or his superiors had already picked someone for the job, Bruno said.

Bruno said he eventually refused to conduct the interviews. “I got a Black person on the other side of the table who has no shot at getting the job,” he told his bosses.

Barry Sommers, CEO of Wells Fargo’s wealth and investment management business, said fake interviews wouldn’t even have been necessary for the financial consultant positions for which Bruno was hiring. Their salaries, Sommers said, fell below the $100,000 threshold that required a diverse slate of candidates to be interviewed per Wells Fargo’s 2020 policy.

“There is absolutely no reason why anyone would conduct a fake interview,” Sommers said. Rather than tracking the identities of interviewees, the bank focused on the results, and “the numbers are getting better,” he said.

Of the nearly 26,000 people the bank hired in 2020, 77% were not white men, Burton said. And last year, 81% of the 30,000 people hired were not white men, she said. She declined to specify how many of those new hires were for jobs above the $100,000 salary threshold.

But six current and former Wells Fargo employees, including Bruno, said fake interviews were conducted for many types of positions. Three current employees said they conducted fake job interviews or knew of them as recently as this year. In 2018, Tony Thorpe was a senior manager for Wells Fargo Advisors in Nashville, Tennessee, overseeing 60 advisers. Thorpe said his boss and the human resources manager overseeing his area told him that if he found a financial adviser worth recruiting, and that adviser wanted to bring a sales assistant along, it was permissible — but the assistant’s job had to be posted publicly.

Thorpe, who retired from Wells Fargo in 2019, said he was instructed to reach out to colleges and business associations in the area where he could meet nonwhite candidates for the assistant job. Thorpe said he never conducted a fake interview, but he was required to document that he had tried to find a “diverse pool” of candidates, even though he knew exactly who would be getting the job.

“You did have to tell the story, send an email verifying what you’ve done,” Thorpe said. “You just had to show that you were trying.”

Burton said that she couldn’t speak to practices under Wells Fargo’s prior management, but that the bank kept records of every job interview. The record-keeping is necessary because the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the nation’s top banking regulator, conducts periodic audits. Although the OCC doesn’t impose its own diversity standards for banks, it does check to make sure they’re following state and federal laws, including anti-discrimination laws.

Don Banks, 31, a Black wealth manager living in Monroe, Louisiana, was contacted by Wells Fargo twice before he was hired. In 2016 and 2017, a human resources representative from the bank told Banks that he had advanced past an initial interview round for a financial adviser trainee position and would be getting a call from a manager. Both times, no one called.

Banks had been submitted to fake interviews, according to a former employee who was a manager in the area where Banks had applied and who participated in the hiring process involving Banks’ application. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because he still works in the industry.

Banks was eventually hired in 2018 by Wells Fargo in a more junior position. Two years later, he was laid off during cutbacks in the pandemic."
"Florida cop looked at girl's naked photos on her phone while driving her to juvie. He was so distracted that he hit a deer. He then gave the girl half of his sandwich, told her ""that sandwich wasn’t free,"" then handcuffed her, groped her butt and breasts and suggested a threesome with her mom.",https://www.tampabay.com/news/crime/2022/09/09/new-port-richey-officer-fired-amid-allegations-of-fondling-girl-in-custody/,nottheonion,"A New Port Richey police corporal has lost his job after an internal investigation confirmed allegations of sexual misconduct raised by a 17-year-old girl who was in his custody.

According to the New Port Richey Police Department, former police corporal Bobby Lubrido, 43, is not facing any criminal charges stemming from the allegations — that he first engaged in inappropriate and explicit conversations while looking at naked photos of the girl on her cellphone before groping her buttocks and breasts.

Still, according to an internal affairs report obtained by the Tampa Bay Times, the probe turned up enough information for New Port Richey Police Chief Kim Bogart to dismiss Lubrido, determining that his “actions in this matter were in violation of numerous departmental rules, regulations and departmental procedures” and that those “improper and unbecoming” actions have “absolutely affected your reputation.”

Lubrido worked for the agency for five years and had no previous disciplinary issues, records show. Before then, he worked as a police officer in Oveido for 10 years and was an Orange County corrections officer for two years.

According to the final disposition of the internal affairs investigation, Lubrido didn’t contest the probe’s findings and decided not to meet with Bogart before his firing.

“He said he did not believe he did anything immoral or illegal,” but Lubrido also “admitted to breaking protocol when he did not properly transport” the girl, Detective Edward Campbell wrote in a summary report of his investigation into the allegations.

According to that internal affairs report, the incident occurred on July 13.

The girl, who has not been publicly named by police, had recently been deemed a runaway when she was spotted by a detective off Ginny Drive in Port Richey. That detective took the girl to Morton Plant North Bay Hospital for a checkup, then arranged to have Lubrido take her to the Juvenile Assessment Center, the report said.

According to the report, the girl asked Lubrido to turn the radio to a specific music channel, and he placed her cellphone on his charger in the front seat at her request. When they arrived at the jail, however, Lubrido was told he was missing signatures on her medical clearance paperwork, which meant he and the girl had to drive back to the hospital.

In his patrol car, Lubrido again placed the girl’s phone on his charger, but this time asked for the password to access the phone. The girl gave it to him but said she was surprised when he started looking at her photo gallery and watching videos of her “twerking” while making comments about her “ass,” the report said.

The girl told detectives Lubrido admitted he was “really trying to see what your (breasts) look like,” and eventually logged into her Snapchat account, where he found a photo of the juvenile’s bare breasts, the report said. Lubrido took a photo of the picture with his phone and continued looking at the naked image while driving back to the hospital, investigators wrote — making sexually explicit comments as he drove.

According to the report, the police corporal was so distracted by the photos that he hit a deer while driving, which was corroborated by dash camera footage and a phone call he made to the agency to report he hit a deer.

Lubrido then arrived at the hospital and obtained the signatures needed for the girl’s medical clearance. He let her eat half of his sandwich, without handcuffs, outside of his cruiser. The girl told investigators she engaged the police officer in sexually explicit banter, hoping he would let her go, the report said. He assured her his body-worn camera had been turned off and that cameras and audio recorders in his vehicle wouldn’t capture their encounter, then handcuffed her again when she was done eating.

The girl told detectives that Lubrido told her, “That sandwich wasn’t free,” and groped her bottom as he cuffed her hands behind her back and placed her into his backseat, the report said. The girl said he then lifted her shirt and bra and groped her breasts.

The girl told investigators that Lubrido pulled up her mother’s photo on his in-vehicle computer and asked if she would be interested in having a “threesome,” to which the girl said no, the report said. She also told Campbell that Lubrido said he would come to her house later to “check up on her.”

“She told me the entire incident made her fearful and untrusting of police,” Campbell wrote.

A review of Lubrido’s patrol vehicle footage showed that no audio from the incident was captured, but movements seemed to corroborate the girl’s story, as did a forensic analysis of the photos and videos accessed on her phone. At one point, the camera captures the girl’s sweatshirt being moved up over her chest while Lubrido placed her in the vehicle, but then the image is blocked by the glare of his flashlight, the report said. No footage of the alleged groping was recovered.

Lubrido denied the girl’s allegations in an interview with investigators, police said.

“When I told him his testimony was inconsistent with the video evidence, he replied ‘yeah,’” Detective Campbell wrote in the report.

Lubrido did not respond to three phone calls from the Times seeking comment for this story."

Madonna: ‘A lot of thought’ went into fully nude NFTs of her giving birth to centipedes,https://www.al.com/life/2022/05/madonna-a-lot-of-thought-went-into-fully-nude-nfts-of-her-giving-birth-to-centipedes.html,nottheonion,"Madonna is defending her NFT as art after criticism of the work, which was made from real scans of her vagina.

The entertainer, 63, teamed up with digital artist Beeple to create the collection “Mother of Creation,” which depicts a nude Madonna giving birth to trees, butterflies and other insects.

NFT stands for a ‘non-fungible token’ and is hailed as a way to ascribe real-world value and scarcity to digital artwork and assets.

According to Madonna, the “Mother of Creation” series connects the ways people create life to the way they create art.

“I wanted to investigate the concept of creation, not only the way a child enters the world through a woman’s vagina, but also the way an artist gives birth to creativity,” the artist explained in a statement, via Yahoo.

There are three, minute-long videos of a digitized Madonna, where different forms of life come out of her body.

The first depicts Madonna giving birth to a tree. “It pushes against gravity and flowers bloom,” the web site explains. “The tree may bend or even break, but it continues to recreate and flourish.”

The second, “Mother of Evolution,” “touches on the metamorphosis journey of butterflies, which are one of the most beautiful creations in nature, and a sign of hope. The butterflies are a metaphor for the paradox that the world is burning down in a post-apocalyptic scene, but there is still evidence of life. We continue to give birth, no matter what destruction is going on, no matter what oppression we face. It relays the important message that if you are waiting for the world to be perfect or for your life to be perfect to create art, it will never happen.”

Finally, in “Mother of Technology” a synthetic centipedes crawl out of Madonna as she lays in a forest.

As it explained by the web site, it is “depicting the way science can also give birth light into the world, but only if used with the right consciousness. The centipede represents technology - both the life giving-force and the dangers of it, the juxtaposition of dark and light. Technology continues to evolve in the physical, natural and real world; we can do whatever we want, but there are consequences to that. Nature will ultimately win in the end.”

Madonna posted a video on Instagram, essentially defending the work.

“I think it’s really important that people know that a lot of thought and conversation went into creating these videos,” she said.

Liz Truss 'pretended relatives had died' to duck BBC Question Time,https://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/23060659.liz-truss-pretended-relatives-died-duck-bbc-question-time/,nottheonion,"Kirsty Buchanan, who was a special adviser to the Prime Minister when she was Justice Secretary, said the fake fatalities included “aunts and cousins and things”.

However Ms Truss eventually ran out of excuses and had to appear on BBC Question Time, where she found herself on a panel with a man she loathed.

Ms Buchanan was speaking on the Whitehall Sources podcast.

She said: “Liz Truss, when I worked for her, she obviously didn’t like the media, so we used to spend quite a lot of time making up excuses and, you know, killing off minor members of her family so that she didn’t have to go on Question Time.

“We ran out of excuses to go on Question Time, so eventually we had to do it.

“Only minor people like aunts and cousins and things, I’m not talking about, you know, major members of the family

“Anyway, so we ended up on Question Time and she said to me, I don’t care who’s on the panel as long as it’s not X, and I’m not going to tell you who X is.

“And we turn up at the Green Room and there is the one person, the one person she didn’t want to go on a panel with, and she looked at me and if looks could kill…

“I don’t know if they did it on purpose because he’s a long time kind of baiter of hers.”

“We used to ‘kill off’ minor family members” to keep Liz Truss off BBC Question Time.

Sheriff apologizes after legally blind man is arrested when cane is mistaken for a gun,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/legally-blind-florida-man-arrested-cane-confused-gun-rcna56396,nottheonion,"Two deputies will be suspended and a Florida sheriff has apologized after a visually impaired man was arrested last month when his walking cane was mistaken for a gun, officials said.

James Hodges, 61, of Lake City, was arrested the morning of Oct. 31 and accused of resisting an officer without violence, according to an arrest report and body camera video of his detainment provided Wednesday to NBC News by the Columbia County Sheriff’s Office.

In a videotaped statement Tuesday on Facebook, Sheriff Mark Hunter identified the arresting deputies as Jayme Gohde and her supervisor, Sgt. Randy Harrison.

James Hodges shows Columbia County police his ""navigational aid"" on Oct. 31. Columbia County Sheriff's Office

The deputies face suspension without pay and Harrison was demoted after an investigation was launched when Hodges requested body camera video of his arrest, Hunter said.

“As sheriff, I take full responsibility for this event and want to extend my sincere apologies to Mr. Hodges for the actions of my deputies,” Hunter said. “I do not feel these deputies’ actions were guided by ill intent, but rather by frustration and failure to rely on their training. Nevertheless, this conduct is unacceptable.”

Hunter said the investigation showed the deputies violated policies. Harrison faces a suspension of seven days without pay. He will not be eligible for any “favorable action” for two years, Hunter said. Gohde faces suspension without pay for two days, Hunter said.

A representative of the sheriff's office clarified Wednesday that Harrison won't be eligible for raises or promotions for two years. The representative said the deputies were unavailable to speak.

They will be required to take remedial training about civil rights, Hunter said.

Hodges could not immediately be reached for comment Wednesday. He told NBC affiliate WTLV of Jacksonville, “Makes my chest swell up, not in a proud way, but in a very appreciative way.”

The arrest report said Gohde stopped Hodges after she saw him enter a crosswalk when a traffic control device indicated not to walk. The morning was foggy and overcast, and drivers were using their headlights, the report said. The report said Hodges appeared to be carrying a “silver (chrome) pistol with a white grip in his back right pocket.”

NBC News does not know what preceded the events in the video the sheriff’s office provided or whether it was edited. The sheriff's representative declined Wednesday to provide additional comment about the video.

According to the 4-minute body camera video, Gohde walks up to Hodges and asks what is in his pocket.

Hodges appears to say it is a navigating aid. He tells Gohde: “What’s the problem? Are you a tyrant?” the video shows.

Gohde responds that she is, actually, and asks Hodges for his name and date of birth, which he refuses to provide, according to the video.

Gohde then appears to say, “Do you want me to put you in handcuffs right now?”

Hodges asks what she suspects, and she tells him that it looks like he is carrying a gun in his back pocket. Hodges, according to the video, takes out the folded-up cane and shows it to Gohde.

They insult each other, and Hodges asks whether he is being detained.

Gohde again asks for his name and date of birth; Hodges declines to give it to her and asks for her supervisor.

Harrison is on the scene, the video shows, and Hodges walks up to him. Harrison explains that the cane could look like a weapon and that he should identify himself when asked, the video shows.

Hodges responds, according to the video, that he doesn’t need to identify himself unless there has been a “reasonable articulated suspicion that I have committed a crime, am committing a crime or about to do a crime.”

Hodges is placed in handcuffs, and Harrison, according to the video, asks him, “Sir, are you legally blind?”

Audio in the video is turned off, but Hodges appears to mouth, “Yes, I am.” He then says, “I had to walk up here in the dark for jury duty, which was canceled.”

The video then shows Gohde asking Hodges whether that was hard, and he responds that he wants her name and badge number.

Harrison reacts to that comment, according to the video: “You know what, put him in jail for resisting.”

As Hodges is placed into a squad car, he yells, “I want your name and your badge number, too, sir.”

In the apology video, Hunter told the public his deputies will continue to work hard for their trust.

“I want to reassure you that as your sheriff, we do make mistakes,” he said. “But we take corrective action to fix them. This is how we get better.”"
Conservative Muslims join forces with Christian right on Michigan book bans,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/oct/16/dearborn-michigan-book-bans,nottheonion,"A recent school board meeting at which about 1,000 people gathered in Dearborn, Michigan, to pressure district officials to censor books with LGBTQ+ themes was in most ways similar to hundreds of other recent book ban hearings across the US.

Speakers alleged the books “promote mental health issues” and “self harm”, while the school district and liberals were seeking to “indoctrinate children”. Gay people, they said, were “creeps and pedohiles”, and gay lifestyles were equated with zoophilia.

“American values and the American way is not child pornography,” one angry parent told the Dearborn public school board.

But the speakers were not the white, rightwing conservative Christians usually behind efforts to censor literature in public schools. Instead, the heated audience was almost all Muslim Arab Americans.

In Dearborn, a city that’s 47% Arab American and reliably Democratic at the polls, some conservative Muslim residents have joined forces with the Christian right to censor literature in the city’s public schools.

Although the right wing in America has frequently vilified Muslims and Islam, the alliance highlights how some deeply socially conservative Arab Americans are willing to put that aside and join in the culture wars. Several parents who spoke with the Guardian insisted the effort had nothing to do with politics and did not answer questions about why they would campaign alongside Donald Trump supporters.

“This has nothing to do with Trump,” Hassan Anoun, a Dearborn schools parent, said, adding that he is a Republican. “We don’t want our kids to be exposed to this. These books should be banned.”

Book ban campaigns have proliferated across the US in part because they reliably stoke conservatives anger toward liberals. A recent American Library Association (ALA) report documented about 1,650 challenges to books made this year through September. The nine-month tally already exceeded the 2021 total.

The challenges typically target books on race and sexuality – about one-third the ALA identified contain LGBTQ+ themes or prominent characters.

The Dearborn hearing was called after a previous meeting on the same topic descended into chaos and was cut short by the school board. Police had to verbally disperse a crowd of largely Arab Americans angered over perceived disrespect from the board, according to reports.

Amid a heavy police presence, the most recent meeting was nearly as chaotic at times. Audience members shouted anti-gay slurs at speakers who opposed banning books or identified as gay, or told them to “sit down and shut up”. At other times, those opposing the book bans shouted at the audience.

Several district teachers and parents charged that the controversy was manufactured by outside political forces seeking to sow divisions.

“Political groups from outside the community are whipping up hate … groups that have a history of embracing anti-Muslim ideology,” said Jason Skidmore, a Dearborn schools parent.

Whether or not the book ban effort started organically, it’s now viewed by Republicans as a political opportunity to drive a social issue wedge into a blue city and voting bloc. Meshawn Maddock, co-chair of the Michigan Republican party, earlier this week tweeted: “Democrats have a BIG problem. Over 800 Muslim and Christian parents showed up to protest the sexualization of their kids in Dearborn Public Schools!”

Meanwhile, at the meeting, Republican Michigan secretary of state candidate Kristina Karamo – widely seen as an extremist – admonished the school board for “sexualizing” children, and Matthew DePerno, a Trump-backed candidate for Michigan attorney general, claimed current Democratic attorney general Dana Nessel “wants to put a drag queen in every classroom”.

Mohamed Mousa, a former Dearborn schools student, told the school board to “listen to the majority and don’t put the books on the shelf”.

Several other parents echoed that sentiment, but it’s unclear that the conservative position is held by the majority in Dearborn. Joe Biden won 74% of the 2020 vote, and in the primary the far more progressive Bernie Sanders handily defeated Biden.

Dearborn’s mayor, Abdullah Hammoud, who was among the Michigan state legislature’s most progressive members when he represented Dearborn in the chamber until last year, came out against the ban, as have other prominent community members.

“The same dangerous ideology that once considered people like me ‘a problem’ in Dearborn is now being revived under the guise of preserving ‘liberty’,” Hammoud wrote on social media.

But tension over LGBTQ+ supporters and metro Detroit’s large Muslim community is not new. Nearby Hamtramck holds large Yemeni and Bangladeshi American populations and elected the nation’s first Muslim-majority city council.

The elected officials ignited a controversy when they called for a pride flag raised on a city-owned pole to be taken down. Meanwhile, a gay Muslim teacher in the city is taking legal action against a charter school for allegedly firing him because of his sexuality.

Here and across the country, school officials have been accused of promoting child porn and pedophilia, sometimes to police. The ALA analysis found police reports had been filed against library staff at least 27 times. Stephanie Butler, a Dearborn schools mother who is credited with calling attention to the controversial books, has said she filed a report over one of the works, called This Book Is Gay. Officers on Thursday said they could not confirm the report.

This Book Is Gay is billed as a guide for coming out for LGBTQ+ teens, adressess stereotypes and is among the books most commonly targeted for bans in the US.

At the meeting’s conclusion, Dearborn resident Jackson Wagner stood up and declared that he was gay, and told the audience: “The far right in this country despises us all.

“Dearborn should be a city where everyone knows they’re safe and loved and supported,” he continued. Moments later, boos rained down as he concluded his brief speech, and he was confronted by Anoun, who had to be ordered back to his seat by police."

A Cincinnati police officer is out of a job after tattooing the words ""pure"" and ""evil"" on his hands.Eric Weyda was fired from the department after getting ""pure"" tattooed on his right knuckles and ""evil"" on his left knuckles. Now he is trying to get his job back. Weyda appealed the decision to dismiss him and filed a grievance through the Fraternal Order of Police.Through public records requests, WLWT learned Weyda was dismissed from the department for insubordination and failure of good behavior in late April, four months after his superiors noticed his new hand tattoo. Department policy prohibits tattoos on the face, neck, head and hands.CPD internal records show after getting the tattoo, Weyda was reassigned to the impound lot ""to limit his public exposure.""Cincinnati police leadership wrote, ""Officer Weyda's tattoos are a violation that is ongoing and permanent. Additionally, Officer Weyda's tattoos do not promote the professional and neutral image of the Cincinnati Police Department and are injurious to the public trust.""In a summary of Weyda's disciplinary hearing, a CPD captain wrote, ""Weyda showed remorsefulness for obtaining the tattoo and acknowledged a lack of discretion since he obtained the tattoo in December 2021. Furthermore, Officer Weyda stated, like all of his tattoos, his hand tattoo has a personal message to him, and the words 'pure evil' should not be observed as one message. Officer Weyda explained the words ""pure"" and ""evil"" are separate from each other and the words themselves have separate meanings.""The summary goes on to say Weyda explained to the Internal Investigations Section the tattoo is meant to represent a ""struggle between good and evil.""The police captain also wrote that ""Officer Weyda's message also has the very real possibility to cause extraordinary damage to police community relations both locally and nationally.""During his disciplinary hearing, police records show Weyda said he would not have the tattoos removed due to the cost of cosmetic surgery. FOP President Dan Hils released the following statement: ""The FOP represents all Cincinnati police officers when they participate in the grievance process outlined in our collective bargaining agreement. Every officer is entitled to a fair hearing and that's what will take place here.""A month before Weyda was reassigned for his tattoo, he was ""counseled"" for doing a burnout in his personal vehicle in the district 3 parking lot. Over his 16 year career with the department, he was disciplined for other reasons including absenteeism and using coarse language on calls.He received commendations in 2012 and in 2013 for investigative skills and apprehending a suspect with a gun. Weyda's annual reviews declined in 2018, which is the same year he started receiving ""needs improvement"" ratings, the second lowest rating on the scale. The low marks continued in 2019, 2020 and 2021.His most troubling year was 2020 when his attendance was marked ""unacceptable"" for the year and he received a ""needs improvement"" rating for community partnerships, complying with policies and procedures, customer service, grooming and dress, teamwork, work product and patrol practices."
"In Search of a Better Life, Thousands of Russians Are Crossing the Mexican Border to America",https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/01/31/in-search-of-a-better-life-thousands-of-russians-are-crossing-the-mexican-border-to-america-a76207,nottheonion,"In summer 2021, Dmitry Politov realized he had to join the growing band of allies of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny fleeing Russia amid an escalating crackdown on dissent. But Politov — who had heard tales of Russian agents harassing, and even assassinating emigres in Europe — decided against joining burgeoning exile communities in Lithuania and Georgia, and set his sights further afield. “I wanted to go to America,” Politov, a bearded, 29-year-old Muscovite who speaks in short, clipped sentences, told The Moscow Times in an interview. “It’s safer. In Europe, there are well-known cases of people being poisoned or murdered.” With the U.S. Embassy in Moscow shutting down consular services amid mass diplomatic expulsions, and tourist visas elsewhere hard to come by under pandemic restrictions, Politov was forced to take extreme measures. On Aug. 9, 2021, two months to the day after Navalny’s organizations were banned as “extremist” by a Moscow court, he boarded a charter flight to the Mexican resort city of Cancun. In a video diary filmed in Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport departures lounge, Politov laid out the plan: Cancel his return flight, slip out of Cancun and make for the frontier city of Tijuana, almost 3,000 miles away. Once there, he’d cross the border into California and claim political asylum in the United States. Politov had set out on one of the last available routes into the U.S. for Russian immigrants, one that is fraught with unforeseen dangers, unscrupulous middlemen and fake asylum claims. The Moscow Times interviewed asylum seekers — some legitimate and some seeking to play the system — who have entered the U.S. via Mexico, and the shady operatives who charge big fees to help them, to cast light on a backdoor into America that is surging in popularity among Russians looking for a better life.

Before the pandemic, the rules for Russians hoping to immigrate to or claim asylum in the U.S. were simple. Back then, Russians persecuted at home, whether as political dissidents or as members of repressed religious groups like the Jehovah’s Witnesses, could come to America on tourist or student visas and claim asylum while already in the country. But the recent wave of emigration — prompted by the Kremlin’s crackdown on political opposition, civil society and independent media — has coincided with an almost total shutdown of Russians’ route to America. First, the pandemic saw U.S. embassies worldwide closed, and a slump in the number of tourist visas issued. More recently, poor relations between the U.S. and Russia forced the American Embassy in Moscow to halt visa services for Russians, as mass diplomatic expulsions and a ban on hiring local employees resulted in skeleton staffing. With the legal door to America effectively closed, Russians have joined the Central Americans, Haitians and Cubans who have traditionally made use of the Mexican border route to the U.S. According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 4,103 Russian citizens were detained at the border in the year to October 2021, a tenfold increase on the year before. In one December incident, border patrol officers fired shots at vehicles carrying Russian migrants across the border. For Yekaterina Mouratova, a Miami-based Russian-American immigration lawyer whose firm provides legal representation for Russian-speaking asylum seekers detained at the southern border, the surge in numbers is the result of a perfect storm of factors, both in the U.S. and abroad. “Most of all, this is about the deteriorating political situation in many post-Soviet countries,” said Mouratova, who singled out Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan — all of which have seen recent political unrest and repression — as particularly well-represented among migrants attempting to cross the border. According to Mouratova, policy changes in the U.S. itself — where the Biden administration has eased Donald Trump’s harsh border policies — have also removed a major deterrent for would-be migrants. “A lot changed when Joe Biden entered the White House,” she said. “People understand that now it’s easier to get asylum on the border than it was before.” On Facebook and the encrypted messenger service Telegram, thousands-strong groups dedicated to U.S. border crossings have sprung up, often run by shadowy immigration brokers who charge would-be immigrants large fees for border-crossing packages. Contacted over Telegram, Vladimir, a Russia-based immigration broker who declined to give his surname, explained his business to The Moscow Times. “You pay $2,500 for the full package. You pay for the Mexican visa, we meet you at the airport in Mexico and drive you across the border.” “We take about 10-12 people [at a time]. It always works, the border isn’t hard to cross. It's so large.”

Clandestine mission For Russian-speaking migrants attempting to cross the border with or without brokers’ help, the Mexico route can often resemble a clandestine mission. Though Cancun is a popular resort for Russians, the Mexican authorities — who have agreements with the U.S. to turn back would-be border crossers — have begun refusing entry at the city’s airport to Russian citizens they suspect of being migrants. Successful migrants told The Moscow Times they had taken elaborate precautions to avoid suspicion, including avoiding flying into Cancun from Moscow and Frankfurt, connecting hubs for Russian travelers. Once in Mexico, like many of his compatriots Politov avoided flying direct from Cancun to Tijuana, a frontier city separated from neighboring San Diego, California by little but a fortified border fence, to avoid arousing suspicion. Traveling to Tijuana after a layover in Mexico City, he hired a pair of Mexican fixers, paying them $1,200 for help crossing to California. It’s a decision he now regrets. “All they do is give you a car, and tell you what direction the border is in,” he said. A first attempt to reach the U.S. side of the border, where migrants are theoretically entitled to claim asylum, failed when an American border guard turned Politov back to Mexico and he spent two nights in jail. “I found out that a lot depends on the person you meet there,” said Politov.

The good life While the Mexico route is heavily used by refugees fleeing political or religious persecution in Russia, some would-be migrants are set on using the asylum system for their own ends. For Anastasia, a hairdresser from a large city on the Volga river, who declined to give her full name, America represented a fresh start. “I decided to leave because my life was kind of not going anywhere,” she said in a telephone interview. “When you watch TV, you can always see how good life could be in America,” she added. Having tracked down an immigration broker through Russia’s Facebook equivalent VKontakte, Anastasia paid $2,500 for the trip through Mexico. Arriving on the border, she applied for political asylum using a false story written for her by the broker. “We told them my family and I are persecuted because we don’t like the authorities,” she said. “I am not sure if what I did was cheating,” she said. “I think it's unfair that I can’t travel to America freely in the first place.” When migrants reach America, they must submit a detailed application laying out their reasons for claiming asylum. Including a questionnaire explaining the migrant’s reasons for fleeing their home, proof of any personal history of persecution, and information on the wider state of human rights in their country of origin, the package is referred to by Russian-speaking migrants as a “case.” Vladimir, the immigration broker contacted by The Moscow Times, said that a pre-written asylum case costs an additional $500. “We come up with cases all the time,” he said. “It's really easy, you just have to use your imagination.” “We can write that you are being threatened due to your political views, or that you are a Jehovah’s Witness, or that you don’t want to serve in the army … All cases are custom-made and unique.” The Moscow Times has obtained what appears to be a U.S. asylum application, pre-written by a broker for Belarusian citizens fleeing political persecution, with only specific personal information left blank, possibly pending payment."
Uvalde superintendent says district to hire more police,https://wgntv.com/news/texas-school-shooting/uvalde-superintendent-says-district-to-hire-more-police/,nottheonion,"This is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.

UVALDE, Texas (AP) — The superintendent of the Texas school district where 19 students and two teachers were fatally shot said Thursday that the district will hire more police officers in the fall but released no information about the investigation.

During a sometimes contentious news conference, Uvalde school district officials said they wouldn’t answer any questions about the investigation or personnel matters.

When Superintendent Hal Harrell was asked if he still trusts the school district’s police chief, Pete Arredondo, he said, “that’s personnel.”

Critics have suggested that Arredondo, who was in charge of the law enforcement response during the May 24 attack at Robb Elementary School, waited too long before agents entered the locked classroom where the gunman was holed up and killed him.

Steven McCraw, the head of the Texas Department of Public Safety, has said Arredondo, who was in charge of the multi-agency response on May 24, made the “wrong decision” to not order officers to breach the classroom more quickly to confront the 18-year-old gunman.

Arredondo has not responded to repeated interview requests and questions from The Associated Press.

The gunman, Salvador Ramos, spent roughly 80 minutes inside the school, and more than an hour passed from when the first officers followed him into the building and when he was killed, according to an official timeline. In the meantime, parents outside begged police to rush in and panicked children called 911 from inside.

Law enforcement and state officials have struggled to present an accurate timeline and details, and made frequent corrections to previous statements. No information about the police response has been released since the days that followed the attack.

There has also been tension between state and local authorities over how police handled the shooting and communicated what happened to the public.

At the news conference Thursday, Harrell announced plans for which campuses Robb students would attend in the fall. He said there are ongoing discussions about what will become of the site where Robb Elementary is located.

“We will not be going back to that campus in any form or fashion,” he said."
"Deaf Colorado man arrested for not complying with police commands he couldn't understand, lawsuit says",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/ncna1280272,nottheonion,"A Colorado man who is deaf and uses sign language to communicate said two Idaho Springs officers slammed him to the ground during an arrest despite his attempts to tell them that he could not understand their commands.

The man, Brady Mistic, said he was wrongfully jailed for four months over the incident on Sept. 17, 2019. He is suing Officers Nicholas Hanning and Ellie Summers, as well as the city of Idaho Springs and the Clear Creek County Board of Commissioners.

The suit, filed this month in U.S. District Court, says the incident began just after 7:30 p.m. Mistic was alleged to have run a stop sign before he pulled into the parking lot of a laundromat. Unaware that police had followed him into the parking lot, Mistic got out of his vehicle and began walking toward the laundromat, according to the lawsuit.

""As Mr. Mistic exited his car and walked past a dumpster in between his vehicle and the police vehicle, toward the laundry door, he was blinded by police vehicle lights and/or a spotlight shone by the officers,"" the suit says. ""He had no idea what was happening, what the police were doing, or if the officers' presence had anything to do with him.""

Mistic stopped walking and used his hands in an attempt to communicate with the officers, the lawsuit says. Mistic uses American Sign Language to communicate, is unable to read lips and can vocalize only a few words, according to the suit. He usually writes messages on a piece of paper to communicate with people who do not know sign language, it says.

The lawsuit claims that without any ""warning or attempt to communicate,"" Hanning grabbed Mistic by the sweatshirt and threw him on the ground, causing Mistic's head to hit the concrete.

""Defendant Hanning pinned Mr. Mistic to the ground on his back while Mr. Mistic held his hands out with his palms facing defendant Hanning in an attempt to show that he meant no harm and was doing nothing to threaten the officer,"" the lawsuit says. ""On the ground, defendant Summers joined in, grabbing Mr. Mistic. ... Defendant Summers pulled out her Taser and drive stunned Mr. Mistic.""

Mistic tried to communicate with the officers by saying ""no ears"" in an attempt to explain that he is deaf, but it did not make a difference, the suit says.

""Defendant Summers ignored Mr. Mistic’s plea and then tased Mr. Mistic a second time,"" it says.

Hanning and Summers could not be reached at phone numbers listed for them. The Idaho Springs Police Department defended the officers' actions, saying Mistic approached a ""clearly marked patrol car"" that had its emergency lights activated.

""The officers gave verbal commands for Mr. Mistic to get back in his vehicle. It was later determined Mr. Mistic was deaf, but this fact was not known to the officers during the initial encounter,"" the police department said in an online statement.

""Officers then directed Mr. Mistic to sit down. At one point officers attempted to gain control of Mr. Mistic by placing him into handcuffs due to his unexplained actions,"" the statement continued. ""Mr. Mistic resisted the officers, and a physical altercation took place.""

Police said Mistic was taken to the hospital for an evaluation and then transferred to the Clear Creek County jail.

""The incident was reviewed by former Chief Christian Malanka and the officers' actions were deemed to be appropriate,"" according to the department.

Hanning was previously fired by the department following the alleged assault of another man, 75-year-old Michael Clark.

Idaho Springs police said in their statement that Hanning suffered a broken leg because of Mistic's ""resistive actions."" The lawsuit alleges that Hanning caused his own injury.

The suit also claims that at some point Summers realized that Mistic was deaf and relayed the information to responding officers and emergency medical services. Still, Mistic was jailed for four months on charges of second-degree assault on a police officer and resisting arrest, it says. During his time in jail, the suit alleges, Mistic was denied an interpreter and had trouble communicating with jail staff members.

The charges were eventually dismissed, and Mistic was released, the lawsuit says.

A spokesperson for the city of Idaho Springs referred to the police statement. The county Board of Commissioners did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

Mistic is seeking compensation for physical and emotional harm, as well as pain and suffering."
IRS faces online uproar over special agent job posting requiring ability to use deadly force 'if necessary',https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/irs-faces-online-uproar-special-agent-job-posting-requiring-ability-use-deadly-force-necessary,nottheonion,"An online job posting for special agents within the law enforcement branch of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is causing a stir on social media, as Congress prepares to pass a spending bill that would greatly expand the federal agency.

A link to a job posting for ""Criminal Investigation Special Agents"" appeared to have been briefly deleted on Wednesday, following online criticism of the posting's language, though it reappeared back online after a FOX Business inquiry to the agency.

A ""key requirement"" for applicants is that they have to be ""legally allowed to carry a firearm,"" and ""major duties"" include ""Carry a firearm and be willing to use deadly force, if necessary"" and ""Be willing and able to participate in arrests, execution of search warrants, and other dangerous assignments,"" according to the job posting.

The requirement that agents be willing to use ""deadly force, if necessary"" drew heated criticism online, although the same language appears in job postings for other law enforcement agencies, such as the FBI.

""The IRS Criminal Investigation special agent job announcement continues to be open on USAJobs and has not/was not taken down. USAJobs is where these positions are posted and where applicants are referred to in order to apply,"" an IRS spokesperson told FOX Business.

""The announcement has been opened since February 2022 and continues through Dec. 31, 2022.""

The uproar over the post coincided with criticism of the proposed expansion of the IRS under the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes an $80 billion boost to the IRS over a 10-year period, with more than half intended to help the agency crack down on tax evasion.

If passed, the money would go toward filling 87,000 IRS positions, more than doubling the agency's current size. The bill passed in the Senate on Sunday with Vice President Kamala Harris casting the tiebreaking vote. It now heads to the House for a likely vote at the end of the week.

MIDDLE-CLASS AMERICANS TO BEAR BRUNT OF IRS AUDITS UNDER DEM INFLATION BILL, ANALYSIS SHOWS

Senate Democrats projected that enhancing IRS funding could add an extra $124 billion in federal revenue over the next decade by hiring more tax enforcers who can crack down on rich individuals and corporations attempting to evade taxes.

But Republicans warn the bill will fund an army of IRS agents to crack down on small business owners and lower-income workers. Americans who earn less than $75,000 per year are slated to receive 60% of the additional tax audits expected under the Democrats' spending package, according to an analysis released by House Republicans.

The analysis, which is a conservative estimate based upon recent audit rates and tax filing data, shows that individuals with an annual income of $75,000 or less would be subject to 710,863 additional IRS audits, while those making more than $1 million would receive 52,295 more audits under the bill.

Overall, the IRS would conduct more than 1.2 million more annual audits of Americans' tax returns, according to the analysis. Another 236,685 of the estimated additional audits would target individuals with an annual income between $75,000 and $200,000.

Democrats insist Americans making less than $400,000 will not be targeted by agents hired due to the spending bill.

In response to criticism about the expected uptick in tax audits under the bill, IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig said Thursday that ""audit rates"" will not increase relative to recent years.

The IRS did not immediately respond to FOX Business' inquiry on why the special agents job posting was deleted.

27 passengers flee plane after pregnant woman allegedly fakes labor to force emergency landing in Spain,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/morocco-spain-flight-pregnant-woman-labor-emergency-landing-pegasus-airlines/,nottheonion,"Spanish police were searching for 14 people who ran from a plane at Barcelona's airport after it made an emergency landing Wednesday to obtain assistance for a pregnant woman who allegedly simulated that she was about to give birth, authorities said.

The office for Spain's government in the Catalonia region said the incident occurred when a Pegasus Airlines flight from Casablanca, Morocco, to Istanbul with 228 passengers on board requested the emergency landing at Josep Tarradellas Barcelona-El Prat Airport.

As the woman was getting evacuated from the plane, 27 passengers exited the aircraft without authorization and ""tried to flee,"" officials said.

Police stopped 13 of them. The other 14 managed to elude the police at the airport and remained at large.

The woman who was thought to be in labor was detained on charges of public disorder after doctors at a hospital determined that, although pregnant, she was not about to give birth.

Of the 13 fleeing passengers grabbed by police, five agreed to get back on the plane and continue on to Istanbul. The other eight were getting processed for non-admission to Spain and expected to be put on another Pegasus flight out of the country, officials said.

The Spanish government's office did not divulge the nationalities of the passengers.

Pegasus, a low-cost airline based in Turkey, offers 82 international flights covering 44 countries, according to its website.

It was the second such incident in just over a year involving a flight from Morocco to Turkey during which a passenger feigned a medical condition in order to force an emergency landing in Spain with dozens fleeing the plane.

On November 5, 2021, another plane from Casablanca to Istanbul was forced to make an emergency landing in Mallorca after one of the passengers appeared to be ill.

After the passenger was disembarked from the plane with a companion, another 21 people fled.

The passenger, who appeared to be going into a diabetic coma, was taken to a hospital but found to be fine and arrested, while his companion fled.

In total, police arrested 12 people, including a passenger who created a disturbance on the plane, while another 12 managed to flee, prompting a manhunt.

All but one were thought to be Moroccans.

"Medieval warhorses no bigger than modern-day ponies, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/10/medieval-warhorses-no-bigger-than-modern-day-ponies-study-finds?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other,nottheonion,"In films and literature they are usually depicted as hulking, foot-stomping, snorting beasts but a new study has claimed that the medieval warhorse was typically a much slighter, daintier animal.

A team of archaeologists and historians searching for the truth about the steeds that carried knights into battle has concluded that most were probably only the size of a modern-day pony.

The researchers examined the bones of about 2,000 horses dating from the fourth to 17th centuries found at castles, a medieval horse cemetery and other archaeological sites in England, as well as combing historical records and fictional stories of chivalry.

“It turns out that things are not quite as they have usually been portrayed,” said Prof Alan Outram, of the University of Exeter’s archaeology department. “In popular culture, warhorses are often depicted as the size of a shire horse. It really wasn’t like that. Most medieval horses are surprisingly small. There are very few that are the sort of size portrayed in film or even in exhibitions.”

Outram said the vast majority of medieval horses, including ones believed to have been used in war, were less than 14.2 hands (4ft 10in) high, the maximum height of a modern pony.

One of the biggest they found was a horse from the Norman period, the remains of which were discovered in the grounds of Trowbridge castle in Wiltshire, but it was only 15 hands – the size of a small modern light riding horse.

Outram said that size clearly wasn’t the be-all and end-all for medieval warriors. He said that there might well have been some particularly large warhorses but armies would also have needed smaller horses for tasks such as harrying a retreating enemy, carrying out long-range raids and transporting equipment.

The research team was keen to spell out they did not mean to imply that medieval horse breeders did not put huge amounts of time, effort and money into their work. “In the 13th and 14th century especially the royal stud was an amazing network,” said Outram. “They were spending much more money on horses than people.”

There is still much work to do. The remains of very few, if any, horses have been found on battlefields so working out which animal was a warhorse rather than, say, a farm horse, is difficult. They are also hampered by the fact that most fallen warhorses were hauled off to the knacker’s yard rather than afforded an organised burial.

The next steps include analysing findings at a site in Westminster, more study of horse armour and examining the DNA of bones to find out more about one of history’s most iconic creatures."
"CIA Launches First Podcast, ‘The Langley Files,’ Which Reveals That Working at the Agency Is More Boring Than Hollywood Makes It Seem",https://variety.com/2022/digital/news/cia-first-podcast-langley-files-1235381103/,nottheonion,"It seems like everyone is launching a podcast these days — and now comes the Central Intelligence Agency.

But don’t expect any major revelations from CIA’s “The Langley Files,” which is really a PR-outreach initiative to burnish the agency’s image as well as dispel notions that it’s a glamorous line of work as often portrayed in pop culture.

As the agency explains, “The mission of ‘The Langley Files: A CIA Podcast’ is to educate and connect with the general public, sharing insight into the Agency’s core mission, capabilities and agility as an intelligence leader… and to share some interesting stories along the way!”

The podcast features suspenseful intro music and a narrator explaining that CIA will be “sharing what we can” with stories that go “beyond those of Hollywood scripts and shadowed whispers.” CIA Director Bill Burns is the featured guest on Episode 1 of “The Langley Files.”

“We do usually operate in the shadows, out of sight and out of mind,” Burns said in the premiere. However, he continued, “in our democracy, where trust in institutions is in such short supply… it’s important to try to explain ourselves the best we can and to demystify a little bit of what we do.”

According to Burns, one of the biggest misconceptions people have about the CIA stems from Hollywood’s depictions of intelligence field agents. Many people think CIA is a “glamorous world” of “heroic individuals who drive fast cars and defuse bombs and solve world crises all on their own” — a la Jason Bourne, James Bond and Jack Ryan. (Bond is a British spy, but you get the drift.) On the podcast, Burns shared that he drives a 2013 Subaru Outback “at posted speed limits.”

Burns also took the opportunity to tout CIA’s recent work, saying that agency analysts last fall “painted a pretty clear picture” of Vladimir Putin’s plans for Russia to launch a major invasion of Ukraine.

The CIA says each episode of the podcast will be about 15-30 minutes long and will “feature our hosts leading conversations with a range of special guests.” The series is distributed on major audio platforms including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Amazon Music and Player.fm.

Somewhat ominously, one of the hosts of “The Langley Files” signed off the inaugural episode with this: “From all of us here at CIA — we’ll be seeing you.”

CALLAWAY COUNTY, Mo. — ""You definitely don’t see this every day, but it is 4/20,"" the Missouri State Highway Patrol tweeted after a crash Wednesday that led to a marijuana bust.

Missouri State Highway Patrol troopers responded to a three-vehicle crash on Interstate 70 Wednesday in Callaway County. Among the bits of plastic and bent metal scattered across the highway, troopers found something else: packaged marijuana.

Not just a little bit, but a lot.

After gathering up all the bags, the highway patrol said the pot weighed in at 500 pounds. All of that marijuana was trying to make its way across Missouri on 4/20, but the trip came to a sudden end after a series of crashes on I-70.

The highway patrol believes a semitrailer driver tried to avoid a previous crash when a pickup truck driver lost control and hit the back of the semitrailer. Another semitrailer went off the road and then hit the pickup truck.

The highway patrol believes all of the marijuana was in the pickup truck, which was occupied by two men and a woman from Mexico. The men were arrested and charged with drug trafficking. All three suffered moderate injuries."
Royal Navy finds uninhabited Henderson Island has been marked on charts in the wrong place for 85 years,https://news.sky.com/story/royal-navy-finds-uninhabited-henderson-island-has-been-marked-on-charts-in-the-wrong-place-for-85-years-12563407,nottheonion,"The Royal Navy has found a remote uninhabited island in the Pacific Ocean has been marked in the wrong place for 85 years.

British sailors have discovered that Henderson Island, which is one of four Pitcairn Islands, is a mile south of the position marked on charts, which have been used by seafarers since 1937.

On Thursday evening, the HMS Spey confirmed the error during efforts to check and update charts regarding British Overseas Territories around the globe.

Sailors used radar and GPS satellites to get new images of the island's exact position and when they were compared with existing charts, it was found the island was in the wrong place.

""In theory, the image returned by the radar should sit exactly over the charted feature - in this case, Henderson Island,"" Lieutenant Michael Royle explained.

""I found that wasn't the case - the radar overlay was a mile away from the island, which means that the island was plotted in the incorrect position when the chart was first produced.

""The notes on the chart say that it was produced in 1937 from aerial photography, which implies that the aircraft which took the photos was slightly off in its navigational calculations.""

Henderson Island is uninhabited and is about the size of Oxford.

It is one of four islands in the remote Pitcairn chain, with Chile 3,600 miles (5,793km) to the east and New Zealand 3,200 (5,149km) miles southwest.

(NEXSTAR) – The Epcot International Festival of the Arts, which kicked off at Disney World on Jan. 14, is said to be a celebration of visual, culinary and performing artists from across the world, with galleries and exhibits planned through Feb. 21.

Judging by the festival’s first day, however, a lot of the visitors were really only in it for the commemorative popcorn buckets.

Included among the new food items at this year’s festival is the “Figment Popcorn Bucket,” modeled after a character from Epcot’s various iterations of the “Journey into Imagination” ride. Filled with rainbow-colored popcorn and shaped like a dragon, the $25 bucket is one of several new and returning treats at the Pop Eats! booth in Epcot.

The bucket was also the star of the show on the festival’s first day, as fans (and online resellers) reportedly waited for upwards of six hours to get their hands on one, according to guests and unofficial Disney blogs. Lines for Pop Eats! also stretched across a good chunk of Epcot, according to video shared by WDW News Today, an unofficial site not affiliated with Disney World.

Both guests and non-guests took to Twitter amid news of the reported wait times, with many in disbelief of the Figment fervor.

“I love Disney but come on,” one user wrote.

“It’s the end of the day and the line for the Figment Popcorn Bucket (and the food) at Pop Eats is STILL estimated to be over two hours!!” another claimed.

Naturally, many of the Figment Popcorn Buckets have since ended up on eBay, with one listed as high as $1,000. Most were going for much less, although eBay recorded at least a few that sold for over $200.

Not everyone was as jazzed about Figment popcorn, though. Universal Orlando Resort, located nearby, reacted to news of Disney’s long lines on Twitter, trying to lure visitors to its own attractions.

“Meanwhile, Jurassic World #VelociCoaster is 35 minutes,” Universal Orlando Resort tweeted on Friday. “Just sayin’.”"
Star Wars awarded most toxic fandom of all by Simon Pegg,https://www.avclub.com/star-wars-most-toxic-fandom-says-simon-pegg-1849211237,nottheonion,"Every fandom has its dark side, but some, it must be said, are worse than others. Simon Pegg may be the leading expert on the topic, having appeared in several major franchises, including Mission Impossible, Star Trek, Star Wars, and Doctor Who, among many other much-beloved properties.

During an appearance on Sirius XM’s Jim And Sam show, Pegg was asked which franchise, in his extensive experience, has “the hardest fans to please.” He replied, “To be honest—and as someone who kind of was, you know, kicked off about the prequels when they came out, the Star Wars fanbase really seems to be the most kind of toxic at the moment. I’m probably being very controversial to say that.”

It’s not really a controversial thing to say to anyone but a member of the toxic side of Star Wars fandom, but Pegg is speaking from personal experience–as an actual toxic fan. He admitted, “I’ve apologized for the things I said about, you know, Jar Jar Binks. Because, of course, there was a fucking actor involved. He was getting a lot of flack and … it was a human being. And because it got a lot of hate, he suffered, you know, and I feel terrible about being part of that.”

On the other end of the spectrum, “I find that Star Trek fans have always been very, very inclusive,” he said. “You know, Star Trek’s about diversity. It has been since 1966, it always was. There’s no sort of like, ‘Oh, you’re suddenly being woke now.’ Star Trek was woke from the beginning, you know?”

Since 2019, Kytch says there was a phone-sized device meant to fix McDonald’s ice cream machine issues through installation. The device was meant to intercept each machines’ internal communications. It was to be sent out to a smartphone or web interface in order to help owners fix their machines, according to Wired.

Though in November 2020, McDonald’s sent out emails requesting all franchises remove the device from their machines. In the emails, McDonald’s said Kytch’s device violated the machines’ warranties and intercepted “confidential information.”

The fast-food chain also said the device could lead to “serious human injury. Kytch denied this claim, calling it defamatory.

“Nothing is more important to us than food quality and safety, which is why all equipment in McDonald’s restaurants is thoroughly vetted before it’s approved for use,” the statement read. “After we learned that Kytch’s unapproved device was being tested by some of our franchisees, we held a call to better understand what it was and subsequently communicated a potential safety concern to franchisees. There’s no conspiracy here.”

Police Union Says SDPD Officers Are Quitting Because of Oversight Commission That Doesn’t Exist Yet,https://voiceofsandiego.org/2022/10/04/police-union-says-sdpd-officers-are-quitting-because-of-oversight-commission-that-doesnt-exist-yet/,nottheonion,"City labor negotiators and the union representing San Diego police officers are at an impasse in negotiations over who can and can’t serve on the Commission on Police Practices, the independent board that investigates allegations of police misconduct.

At Monday’s City Council meeting, the San Diego Police Officers Association argued family members of current or former local law enforcement officers should be able to serve on the board, while city labor negotiators say they shouldn’t. They also split on whether individuals with a felony record can be appointed to the commission – police union representatives say no, and city negotiators say anyone whose criminal record doesn’t bar them from serving on a jury should be eligible.

SDPD Sgt. Jared Wilson, the POA president, said the CPP — which is yet to be fully implemented, in part because of the stalled negotiations — was one of the reasons officers were leaving San Diego for jobs in other cities. He said the commission had a “radical, abolish the police agenda” and that “our cops are better off somewhere else.”

The city’s lead labor negotiator, Tim Davis, said the CPP ordinance was “very carefully crafted and balanced.” He asked the City Council to approve a resolution resolving the impasse, which would allow the ordinance to move forward for an implementation vote at a later date.

Andrea St. Julian, an attorney and co-chair of San Diegans for Justice, who authored the ballot measure that created the CPP, said she has family members in law enforcement whom she consulted when working on the measure.

“There is nothing about me or my background that makes me anti-police,” she said.

Councilwoman Monica Montgomery Steppe, whose office oversaw the drafting of the CPP ordinance, said guidance on the makeup of the commission came from the National Association of Civilian Oversight of Law Enforcement—the leading authority on citizen oversight—“and not from anti-police sentiment.”

Councilman Chris Cate was the lone vote against moving the ordinance forward. He said his father is a retired law enforcement officer.

“Being told that I can’t serve on a commission because there might be a perceived conflict of interest… I take that a little personally,” he said.

Councilmembers said they were sympathetic to the POA’s position but were also concerned that allowing a law enforcement presence on the board would erode the trust of communities who’ve pushed for stronger oversight."
Ohio attorney indefinitely suspended from Supreme Court for repeatedly driving naked,https://www.wdtn.com/news/ohio/ohio-attorney-indefinitely-suspended-from-supreme-court-for-repeatedly-driving-naked/,nottheonion,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (WTRF) — The Supreme Court of Ohio indefinitely suspended a Hamilton, Ohio, attorney for repeatedly driving naked and exposing himself to other motorists.

During an October 2018 traffic stop, Blauvelt was charged with public indecency and reckless operation of a vehicle when it was discovered that he was driving nude.

Blauvelt pleaded guilty to the charges and was imposed in June 2020 by the Supreme Court a two-year, fully stayed suspension.

The Court noted that Blauvelt has a history of public nudity.

Three months after his 2020 suspension, the Butler County Bar Association requested an interim remedial suspension on the grounds that Blauvelt was twice again arrested for nude driving and exposing himself, and that he posed a substantial threat of serious harm to the public.

The suspension in effect today is based on a subsequent complaint filed by the Butler County Bar Association in June 2021, which alleged that Blauvelt had been convicted of three additional counts of public indecency since he was first suspended, according to Court News Ohio.

Blauvelt pleaded guilty to all charges. His sentence includes fines, a total of 14 days in jail, and probation terms ranging from two to five years.

Blauvelt also admitted that he had engaged in other similar acts of public indecency for which he was not arrested.

The Supreme Court noted that Scott Blauvelt is in treatment for bipolar disorder and has expressed remorse for his behavior, but the Court also noted that he still struggles with the urge to engage in his illicit behavior.

To be reinstated to the practice of law in Ohio, Blauvelt will have to meet several conditions, including proving that he is in full compliance with his mental-health treatment plan and orders from the Butler County Area III Court."
"Kim Jong-un's Father Invented Burritos in 2011, Says North Korea in Bizarre Claim",https://www.news18.com/news/buzz/kim-jong-uns-father-invented-burritos-in-2011-says-north-korea-in-bizarre-claim-4629206.html,nottheonion,"Who doesn’t love Burritos? We are pretty sure everyone does but not to the extent of claiming to invent the delicious dish. In case you are wondering what we are talking about, a bizarre claim has been made by North Korea that Kim Jong-un’s late father Kim Jong-il invented burritos in 2011. North Korea’s propaganda mouthpiece Rodong Sinmun shared a report claiming that Kim Jong-il had invented burritos, which they call ‘wheat wraps,’ in 2011 before he died. The story also mentions late Kim Jong-il inventing ‘double bread with meat,’ a dish quite similar to a hamburger.

Rodong Sinmun has also claimed that Kim Jong-un has been taking a great interest in the dish like his father. In a State TV news footage, North Koreans can be seen eating burritos outside the Kumsong food factory at a stand in Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea. Photographs of the late dictator touring a kitchen with sunglasses and smiling with cooks while the burritos were being made were also shown in the footage.

However, the reality is far from what is shown in the State TV news footage. According to people who have escaped North Korea, a large section of the country’s citizens can’t even dream of having such a proper meal. Hyun Seung Lee, who was born in an elite Korean family, escaped from the country in 2014. He told The Sun that most citizens barely have money to buy foreign food. He added that bread and butter were even criticized as socialist traitors by the dictator in the 90s. When asked about burritos, Lee revealed that even the ingredients required to make the dish are not available in North Korea. He has not seen any restaurant where you can eat burritos.

Rowan Beard, who works as a guide with Young Pioneer Tours that primarily organizes North Korea trips, told The Sun that he has not seen any dish called ‘wheat wraps’ in Pyongyang.

The origin of burritos is still not clear but the word was coined in an 1895 Mexican dictionary.

Nevada Republican Jim Marchant insisted there hadn’t been a legitimate election in his state in more than a decade. All of Nevada’s election winners since 2006, he said on a recent podcast, were “installed by the deep-state cabal.”

But when Marchant won the Republican nomination for Nevada secretary of state this week, he immediately celebrated the victory as legitimate.

“I am beyond humbled by the overwhelming support of our campaign. Nevadans made their voices heard,” Marchant declared on social media.

Such inconsistency has become a hallmark of election deniers in Republican primary contests across the U.S. in this year’s midterms. Dozens of GOP candidates who sought former President Donald Trump’s backing in Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and elsewhere have spent months parroting his baseless claims of 2020 election fraud but then declared victory without raising such concerns in their own elections.

Amid such seeming hypocrisy, many Republican candidates are still vowing to pursue a series of election reforms that could make it more difficult to vote — particularly for those who traditionally support Democrats — in the name of election integrity.

Democratic National Committee Chair Jamie Harrison warned that “MAGA Republicans will do anything in their desperate chase for power.”

“From undermining our democracy by spreading Trump’s Big Lie, to laying the groundwork to try to cancel votes when they don’t agree with the outcome, but falling silent if they win, this is today’s Republican Party,” Harrison told The Associated Press.

In Nevada on Tuesday, Marchant was among a slate of election deniers who secured their places on the November ballot without questioning the legitimacy of the results. The group included candidates for Senate, state treasurer and a Las Vegas-area congressional seat. That’s even as the majority of counties relied upon Dominion voting machines, which continue to be the target of conspiracy theories by Trump and his allies.

The phenomenon extends well beyond Nevada.

In Pennsylvania, Republican nominee for governor Doug Mastriano spearheaded a state Senate hearing in which witnesses — including former Trump campaign attorneys Jenna Ellis and Rudy Giuliani — aired false claims about mass voter fraud. Mastriano also was outside the U.S. Capitol when a mob of Trump supporters stormed the building during the deadly 2021 insurrection. And he later tried to bring a partisan election audit to Pennsylvania before he was stripped of his committee chairmanship by his own party.

Mastriano made no mention of voter fraud as he declared victory in Pennsylvania’s Republican primary for governor last month.

“God is good,” a smiling Mastriano told cheering supporters.

The Mastriano campaign declined to respond to a question about the apparent double standard.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton also ignored questions about his contradictory positions on voter fraud.

Paxton won his fiercely contested primary last month after spending much of the last year championing Trump’s bogus claims of election fraud. In the aftermath of Joe Biden’s presidential win, Paxton filed a legal challenge to the election results in four battleground states. He asked the U.S. Supreme Court to set them aside and allow the Republican-controlled state legislatures to determine the winner.

Seventeen other Republican state attorneys general supported the effort.

The high court rejected the challenge three days after the lawsuit was filed, finding Texas did not have standing to sue other states over how they conduct their elections. And the state bar moved to discipline Paxton just days after his primary win, claiming his leading role in petitioning the Supreme Court to block Biden’s victory was “dishonest.”

State and federal election officials across the country and Trump’s own attorney general have said there is no credible evidence the election was tainted. The former president’s allegations of fraud also were roundly rejected by courts, including by judges he appointed.

But after nearly two years of Trump’s constant claims that the election was “stolen,” which have been embraced by hundreds of Republican candidates across the U.S. seeking his support, an extraordinary number of Americans have lost faith in the U.S. election system.

Only 45% of U.S. adults said they have significant confidence that votes in the 2022 midterm election will be counted accurately, and 30% have some confidence, according to a February AP-NORC poll. Democrats were much more likely than Republicans to be very confident, 66% vs. 24%.

Polling continues to show most Republicans have doubts about the 2020 presidential election. In July 2021, 68% of adults -- but only 33% of Republicans -- said Biden was legitimately elected president, according to an AP-NORC poll . Sixty-six percent of Republicans said he was not legitimately elected.

In addition to key state officials, several Trump-backed Senate candidates promoted the specter of election fraud over and over — except when delivering their primary victory speeches in recent weeks.

Georgia Republican Senate nominee Herschel Walker repeatedly claimed Biden’s victory was tainted by fraud over the last year and even called for seven swing states Trump lost to vote again. Ohio GOP Senate candidate J.D. Vance claimed the 2020 election was “rigged” or “stolen.” North Carolina Senate nominee Ted Budd, a Republican congressman, refused on the day of his May primary victory to say that Biden won the 2020 presidential election. And Pennsylvania Republican nominee for Senate Mehmet Oz said there was “definitely” widespread fraud in his state, even as the evidence says otherwise .

ADVERTISEMENT

None raised similar claims about their own primary victories.

In Nevada, state GOP Chair Michael McDonald said Marchant acknowledging his primary win wasn’t hypocritical because he continued to have questions about vote-counting in the Las Vegas area.

“He was questioning the results last night, even though he was winning, which I found admirable,” McDonald said, recounting a 1:30 a.m. phone call with Marchant.

Marchant did not respond to requests for comment, but his campaign consultant Rory McShane said he continued to have questions about voting in Clark County, which leans Democratic and is where the vast majority of the state’s population lives, despite the race being called for him.

There may be no more vocal proponent of Trump’s baseless claims of election fraud falsehoods than Marchant, a 66-year-old former failed congressional candidate.

Marchant was present in Carson City when the party sent a dueling slate of electoral votes to Congress in December 2020. Throughout the primary, he was a fixture at rural county commission meetings during discussions about Dominion voting machines and potentially switching to hand-counting ballots. And he has toured the country with other 2020 election denialists, using phrases and terminology associated with QAnon conspiracy theorists.

ADVERTISEMENT

Cisco Aguilar, the Democrat running against Marchant, described the Republican’s statements about the 2020 election, voting machines and mail-in ballots as out of touch with reality.

In an interview, Aguilar said he feels immense responsibility after Marchant’s victory and said he’s now weighing questions he hadn’t anticipated when he entered the race, such as whether agreeing to a debate would be giving a conspiracy theorist a platform.

“He’s created a massive fear among a subgroup of individuals here in Nevada,” Aguilar said. “I don’t even know if you can have a debate with someone who is unwilling to listen.”

"Workers asking for pay rises risk embedding inflation, says Bank boss",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/05/workers-asking-for-pay-rises-risk-embedding-inflation-says-bank-boss-andrew-bailey,nottheonion,"Workers should refrain from asking for inflation-matching pay rises, according to the governor of the Bank of England, who warned there was a risk of inflation becoming “embedded”.

Andrew Bailey, who added that he does not expect interest rates to settle at pre-financial crisis levels of about 5%, refused to be drawn on what an appropriate pay rise would be, a day after he warned inflation would hit 13% in October. The Bank’s inflation target is 2%.

“If everybody tries to beat inflation – and that is in both price-setting and wage-setting – it doesn’t come down, it gets worse,” he said, speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Friday. “My key point is, if inflation becomes embedded and persistent, it gets worse. And the effects get worse.”

The UK is embroiled in a summer of strikes by workers in industries from rail and aviation to post and telecommunications as unions attempt to secure increases to allow members to keep wages in line with inflation levels running at a 40-year high.

Bailey acknowledged that as the UK heads into recession and inflation soars, it is the poorest who are being affected most by the cost of living crisis.

“In this world it is the people who are least well-off who are worst affected because they don’t have the bargaining power,” he said. “That is something broadly that we all have to be very, very conscious of.

“There are a lot of people out there who are very badly affected by this inflation – all inflation affects people on low incomes badly – but this time particularly because it is concentrated in energy and food. Those are the essentials of life. There is a role in society to reflect on the fact there are people who do not have the same ability to offset the impact of inflation that are going to be very badly affected by this.”

On Thursday the Bank of England made its biggest increase in interest rates in 27 years in an attempt to curb soaring inflation as gas prices drive up UK energy bills this winter. The 0.5% rise to 1.75% takes the UK interest rate to a 13-year high and is the sixth rise in a row.

Bailey said the country had faced a domestic shock in the form of a shrinkage in the labour force over the last two years, causing widespread hiring problems, as well as soaring energy and food prices caused in part by the war in Ukraine as well as supply chain problems because of the Covid pandemic.

“We have had a domestic shock, we have had a shrinkage in the labour force over the last two years or so. I go around the country a lot; I talk to businesses a lot. The first thing businesses want to talk to me about is the problems they are having hiring people, and that is still going on. They are also saying to us actually they are not finding it difficult to raise prices at the moment. I think that can’t go on.”

Bailey would not put a figure on where he thought rates might return to once inflation eases but said he expected it to be below the levels of 4% to 5% seen before the 2008 financial crisis.

“We don’t know in any quantitative term,” he said. “I don’t think that in the steady state we are going back to where we were before the financial crisis.”

Paul Johnson, the director of the economic thinktank the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the next prime minister was going to have to find billions to support households and key services such as the NHS.

“Thirteen per cent inflation is an extraordinary number and it will have an impact on the public finances,” he said. “They are going to have to find many more billions to support households.

“This is a much bigger increase in energy bills than was expected a few months ago when the support packages were announced. And of course there is going to need to be more money for public services – the health service, education and so on – because with inflation at 13% … we are looking at potentially big real-terms cuts to some of the public services that are really struggling at the moment.”"

"Law Enforcement ""Isn't a Profession,"" Judge Rules In Challenge To Arizona's Clemency Board",https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/law-enforcement-isnt-profession-judge-rules-in-challenge-to-arizonas-clemency-board-13461606,nottheonion,"A judge has dismissed death row prisoner Clarence Dixon's last-ditch effort to challenge the makeup of Arizona's clemency board.Attorneys for Dixon had argued that the board, which later this month will consider commuting the death sentence, was illegally stacked with former cops.State law requires that the board have no more than two members from any professional discipline. Three members of the five-person board worked in law enforcement for decades. The board chair is a former assistant attorney general, and the other seat is vacant.But Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Stephen Hopkins disagreed. On Tuesday morning, Hopkins struck down the special action suit, which was filed last week, on the grounds that law enforcement ""has not been thought of as a 'profession.'""Dixon's execution is scheduled for May 11. Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich has tried for a year to issue a death warrant in his case.Dixon was convicted of the murder of Deana Bowdoin, a 21-year-old ASU student, who was raped and stabbed to death in her apartment in 1978. Dixon, Bowdoin's neighbor at the time, wasn't connected to the crime until decades later, when DNA evidence led detectives to him. He was already serving life in prison for another sexual assault of a young woman.Bowdoin's sister has continued to advocate for Dixon's other victims in the years since, and has said she supports the death penalty in his case. ""When my mother passed in 2009, all she wanted was some final justice for Deana, and that people would always remember Deana,"" her sister, Leslie, wrote in a letter to governor Doug Ducey in 2020.If the execution proceeds as scheduled, it will be the first time that Arizona has carried out the death penalty since a badly botched execution in 2014.In the days since Dixon's death warrant was issued, his team of attorneys has been busy attempting to stay the execution. They have argued that Dixon's execution would be unconstitutional, given his well-documented, serious mental illness.And they also filed this special action suit, arguing that the clemency board's makeup violated Dixon's right to fair legal proceedings.The Arizona Board of Executive Clemency considers a variety of petitions from imprisoned people for commutations or pardons. Only the governor has the power to commute sentences, but he considers the recommendations of the clemency panel.Dixon's case is the first capital case that the board has heard in years, and thus the first such case that has been heard by these five panelists. Clemency hearings are one of the last legal obstacles standing in the way of an execution. Dixon's hearing is scheduled for April 28, less than two weeks before his scheduled death.In their lawsuit, Dixon's attorneys made the case that three board members — Salvatore Freni, Louis Quiñonez, and Michael Johnson — all came from the same professional discipline, law enforcement.The three board members have, between them, a combined 85 years of experience in the field. Freni and Johnson worked at the Phoenix Police Department for 30 years and 21 years, respectively. Freni served as an officer, detective, and lieutenant; Johnson spent most of his time as a homicide detective, and later went on to serve three terms on the Phoenix City Council.Quiñonez, meanwhile, worked for 27 years as a federal law enforcement officer with several agencies, and has since taught criminal justice at Glendale Community College.Hopkins, in his ruling, questioned whether law enforcement could be considered a profession at all. ""It is not regulated as other professions are, and has little of the characteristics of what is typically considered a profession,"" he wrote. This, he said, called Dixon's argument into question.""If the legislature intended to say, 'no more than two members of the Board may have prior law enforcement experience,' it could have easily done so,"" he wrote.Furthermore, Hopkins ruled that attorneys had not successfully argued that the three board members came from different disciplines, given their separate roles in law enforcement. ""To the extent law enforcement may be considered a 'profession,' the Court finds from the information presented that each of these three members represents a different 'discipline' within the large rubric of law enforcement,"" he wrote.In a statement Tuesday, attorneys for Dixon said they planned to appeal the ruling.""Mr. Dixon is entitled to a fair clemency hearing before an impartial clemency board that complies fully with state law, not one that is illegally stacked with law enforcement officials,"" wrote Joshua Spears, one of Dixon's attorneys. ""We are reviewing our options to appeal the Superior Court’s ruling.""You can read Judge Hopkins' full opinion below:"

A Canadian citizenship ceremony was delayed on Thursday as officials figured out whom to swear allegiance to after Queen Elizabeth II's death, according to a journalist who attended.

On Thursday afternoon, the Queen ""died peacefully at Balmoral,"" the Buckingham Palace announced, ending her unprecedented 70-year reign. She was 96 years old. Her son automatically ascended to the throne with her death and will be known as King Charles III.

The virtual Canadian citizenship ceremony, which had 141 attendees, was halted as officials talked to each person individually, investigative journalist Roberto Rocha, who attended the ceremony with a friend, tweeted.

The presiding judge mentioned Queen Elizabeth II's death after the ceremony began, adding that the new monarch is now King Charles III.

""It was a quick and sober acknowledgment, extremely Canadian,"" Rocha tweeted. ""He's more excited about welcoming the new citizens to the Canadian family.""

When the participants took the citizenship oath, Rocha said they swore allegiance to ""Sa majesté le roi Charles III, roi du Canada"" — His Majesty King Charles III, King of Canada.

The new Canadian citizens may have been the first to swear allegiance to the new monarch.

Gov. DeSantis signs legislation proclaiming Nov. 7 as ‘Victims of Communism Day’,https://www.news4jax.com/news/florida/2022/05/09/desantis-signs-legislation-proclaiming-nov-7-as-victims-of-communism-day/,nottheonion,"MIAMI, Fla. – Governor DeSantis on Monday signed a bill designating Nov. 7 as “Victims of Communism Day.”

The bill (H.B. 395) will require Florida students to learn about the destructive effects of communism around the world.

The instruction will begin in the 2023-2024 school year for students enrolled in a U.S. government course. The bill requires at least 45 minutes of teaching about communist victims on the recognition day.

The signing ceremony took place in Miami’s Freedom Tower.

“From 1959 to 1974, more than 650,000 Cubans came to the United States to have to flee the oppressive communist regime of Fidel Castro. Many of them came to South Florida either by plane or by boat, and once they landed, they would be taken right here to the Freedom Tower where they receive assistance and began their new life in the United States,” said DeSantis.

DeSantis also approved $25 million for the restoration of the Freedom Tower at Miami Dade College. The Freedom Tower is considered the “Ellis Island of the South” for its role from 1962 through 1974 as the Cuban Assistance Center, offering nationally sanctioned relief to the Cuban refugees who sought political asylum from the regime of Fidel Castro.

“This bill is so important because what you don’t recognize and don’t learn about, you tend to repeat,” said Madeline Paumariega, Miami Dade College president. “And so, always keeping front and center that there are victims of communism, some that you will never see.”

Florida is home to tens of thousands of people who have fled communist governments, especially Cubans who left after Fidel Castro took power on the island in 1959. Nov. 7 is the day in 1917 when Russia’s Bolshevik Revolution installed a communist government there."
3 high school graduations across the U.S. end with gunfire in less than 24 hours,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/3-high-school-graduations-us-end-gunfire-less-24-hours-rcna29770,nottheonion,"Three high school graduation ceremonies ended with shots fired in separate incidents in Louisiana, Michigan and Tennessee within the span of 24 hours, another sobering example of gun violence impacting everyday lives, including that of teenage students.

After students crossed stages to receive their diplomas, chaos ensued with gunfire.

At least one person was killed and seven others injured in collective shootings that resulted in the arrest of a 17-year-old gunman in Tennessee.

Louisiana

Shots were fired Thursday night around 8:15 p.m as graduates of Hammond High School were leaving their ceremony held on the campus of Southeastern Louisiana University to meet with their families, police said.

Four people were injured in the gunfire, all with non-life-threatening injuries, Hammond PD Chief Edwin Bergeron Jr said in a Thursday night news conference. Three were transported to an area hospital.

A suspect was located after a short foot pursuit and taken into custody, Southeastern Louisiana University Police Chief Michael Beckner told NBC News Friday morning.

Charges are pending as the probe continues and all parties involved were adults, Beckner said.

Police said Thursday no Hammond High School students are believed to be involved in the shooting.

“At this time we do not believe that there were any students involved, we do not believe any juveniles were struck in this incident,” Bergeron said.

Police are asking for witnesses, or people with video footage of shooting to come forward.

There were Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff’s Office deputies on site working security for the graduation who responded to the shooting and the “situation was taken under control very quickly,"" officials said.

Tangipahoa Parish Superintendent of Schools, Melissa Martin Stilley, said Thursday, ""We apologize to our families and to our students that this night, which should have been a very happy occasion for our graduates and their families, ended on such a sad note.""

Hammond High School students will have a virtual school day Friday, though faculty will go into to school, she said.

Michigan

A shooting erupted at the East Kentwood High School campus outside the football stadium in Michigan on Thursday during a graduation ceremony for Crossroads Alternative High School at around 7:20 p.m., injuring two, the Kent County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement.

Two deputies were on site working security for the ceremony, but by the time deputies got to the parking lot on foot, “the suspect vehicles had fled.”

Kent County Sheriff Michelle LaJoye-Young said in a Thursday evening news conference that people in two cars were exchanging gunshots.

She said “a large number of shots” were fired at the scene.

The sheriff's office said two victims in the shooting were later located at area hospitals: a 16-year-old from Texas who was shot in the wrist and is in stable condition and a 40-year-old woman from Grand Rapids who was shot in the wrist and abdomen in critical but stable condition.

It's not clear if the victims were connected to the graduation.

The sheriff’s office believes there were more than two individuals opened fire. Initial reports indicate two white sedans with multiple people inside fled the scene at a high rate of speed, officials said.

Authorities are also asking for witnesses or people with video or photo footage of the incident to submit tips.

Tennessee

A 17-year-old was arrested in a deadly shooting after a graduation ceremony for Riverdale High School held at the Middle Tennessee State University campus shortly before 9 p.m. Wednesday as the crowd was leaving.

Hasani Brewer, 18, was killed and a 17-year-old high school student wounded, police said. Brewer and the teenager who was shot had gotten into a fight when a third person opened fire, police spokesperson Larry Flowers said at a news conference.

The suspect, who is also 17, was not identified because of his age. He will be arraigned in juvenile court on a first-degree murder charge, Flowers said.

Brewer was a past graduate of the high school, and the wounded teenager is a junior, he said.

“The graduation was just ending, people were leaving, this fight began — so just imagine the chaos when shots rang out,” Flowers said."
Pregnant inmate who lost baby after jail staff allegedly stopped at Starbucks en route to hospital reaches $480K settlement,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/pregnant-inmate-lost-baby-jail-staff-allegedly-stopped-starbucks-en-ro-rcna45161,nottheonion,"A pregnant inmate who claimed her baby died after staffers at a California jail stopped at a Starbucks en route to the hospital has been approved to receive a $480,000 settlement.

The Orange County Board of Supervisors unanimously approved the proposed settlement Tuesday for the delayed transportation of Sandra Quinones to a hospital in 2016, according to minutes of the meeting. NBC News has reached out to the county board for comment.

Quinones filed a complaint against Orange County, California, in April 2020, alleging wrongful death and infliction of emotional distress in the death of her child.

Quinones was in Orange County jail and six months pregnant on March 28, 2016, when her water broke, according to the complaint.

She pushed the call button in her cell with no response for two hours, the complaint said. Staffers at the jail failed to call an ambulance and transported her to the hospital on a “non-emergency basis,” it said.

She accused the defendants of acting with “deliberate indifference” to her medical needs — including stopping at a Starbucks on the way to the hospital, instead of taking her directly there.

Quinones and her baby were hospitalized and her child died, the complaint said.

The case was dismissed in October 2020 with prejudice upon the grounds that her claims were barred by California’s two-year statute of limitations and she didn't sufficiently support her claims.

She claimed the incident took place March 2016 but didn’t launch the lawsuit until about three-and-a half years later on September 9, 2019 when she was added to a separate civil action case against the county.

The case was reinstated in 2021 in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.

The complaint said Quinones spent a “significant amount of time since the death of child in custody.""

Under California's Penal Code 352.1 if a person entitled to start legal civil action for deprivation of rights is imprisoned, that time of “disability” is not part of the time limit for the commencement of legal action, if it doesn't exceed two years.

NBC News has reached out to the lawyer representing the county in the case. The Orange County Sheriff's Office did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

“Ms. Quinones will never forget how she was treated that day and no amount of money will ever make her whole,” Nicholas Kohan, one of the lawyers representing Quinones, said Monday.

“However, I am pleased with the result and that the County of Orange acknowledged its wrongdoing. Hopefully this will lead to better conditions and treatment for pregnant women in the Orange County jail.""

Another attorney for Quinones, Richard Herman, told the Los Angeles Times his client was homeless and had mental health issues but still persisted in the case.

“She doggedly pursued this case, including all of its ups and downs,” Herman said. “This was a long, hard fight. We’re glad that this reached a successful conclusion.”

Quinones is now out of custody and living with her mother, he said."
"Japan should consider hosting U.S. nuclear weapons, Abe says",https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2022/02/27/national/politics-diplomacy/shinzo-abe-japan-nuclear-weapons-taiwan/,nottheonion,"Former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Sunday that Japan should break a long-standing taboo and hold an active debate on nuclear weapons – including a possible “nuclear-sharing” program similar to that of NATO – in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

“Japan is a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and has its three non-nuclear principles, but it should not treat as a taboo discussions on the reality of how the world is kept safe,” Abe said during a television program.

Abe, who quit as prime minister in 2020 but remains highly influential as head of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party’s largest faction, noted that had Ukraine kept some of the nuclear weapons it inherited after the breakup of the Soviet Union instead of exchanging them for a security guarantee, it may not have faced an invasion by Russia."
Data Finds Republicans are Obsessed with Searching for Transgender Porn,https://lawsuit.org/general-law/republicans-have-an-obsession-with-transgender-porn/,nottheonion,"Closet Cases – Republicans secretly love what they publicly hate

So far in 2022, more than 300 anti-LGBT bills have been proposed across 36 states – at least one third of which are directed at trans youth. This surge, especially in anti-trans legislation from Republicans, stands in stark contrast to a startling fact.

Republicans love transgender porn, A LOT.

With more than 4.7 Million transgender porn related Google searches each month (per Ahrefs.com), do Republicans represent those searching most? The answer seems to be a clear YES.

Search Popularity by metro area for the keyword “Femboy”

In fact, the more Republican they are, the more they seem to like it. (see below)

To understand the Republicans’ love for transgender related porn, we scraped daily Google search trend data from June 1, 2022 to June 19, 2022, segmented by DMA (metro area) and compared search volume to both 2020 election voting trends, and public opinions about LGBT rights.

The data tells a tragic tale of self-loathing closet cases, Republicans who privately get off sexually to trans folks, while publicly trying to remove trans peoples’ rights and stoking hate against them.

Lets get into it...

Who is Most Obsessed With Searching for Trans Porn?

The map visualizations below shows the popularity of the 10 highest volume Transgender Porn related Google Searches, broken down by DMA (Metro Area/County).

**Search terms for the list ranking include only: “shemale”, “tranny”, “femboy”, and “ladyboy”

Search Popularity by metro area for the top 10 most popular transgender porn keywords

The More Red You Get, The More You Love Trans Porn

While the maps and rankings might make it seem obvious that there’s a correlation between conservatism and searching for transgender porn, but by plotting linear regression trend lines, we can better understand the strength of the correlation. In these views, we look at search volume for three different keyword groups vs metro area political leaning. Each dot represents a metro area. Dots are colored their ratio of Democratic vs. Republican votes in the 2020 presidential election. The higher the value (more red), the higher the percentage of that metro area voted for Donald Trump.

Data suggests that the more “Republican” (based on 2020 Presidential voting data) a metro area is, the more that area searches for transgender related porn.

Below you can find the linear regression test values. While this data has low Rsquared values, our P-values show that even this noisy, high-variability data can have a significant trend. The trend indicates that the predictor variable (political leaning) still provides information about the response (transgender search popularity) even though data points fall further from the regression line. For all keywords we investigated, P-values were significant, allowing us to reject the Null Hypothesis. Thus, there is a statistically significant correlation between being more republican, and trans porn search volume, grouped by DMA.

“Shemale” Linear Regression Values “Tranny” Linear Regression Values “Femboy” Linear Regression Values

R-squared: .0669668

T-Value: 3.81706

P-Value: .0001793 R-squared: .0326781

T-Value: 2.61873

P-Value: .0094915 R-squared: .0401511

T-Value: 2.91404

P-Value: .003968

The More You Hate Them, The More You Love Them

By adding survey data from PRRI.org, (Opinion on businesses being allowed to discriminate against LGBT patrons), we see a similar correlation that indicates those with stronger anti-LGBT feelings tend to search more for transgender porn.

While political leaning is an interesting way to understand the trends in this data, we wanted to better compare search volume data with more direct local estimations of prejudice.

To accomplish this, we looked at data from ava.prri.org, an organization that surveys 50,000 Americans annually across 30 metro areas every year on social and religious opinions. One question they ask is “Do you support religiously based refusals to serve gay and lesbian people?” Respondents could answer “Favor,” “Oppose,” or “Don’t Know/Not Sure.”

We felt this survey question was a decent proxy for baseline LGBT prejudice, though we recognize some may support the question on Libertarian or Personal freedom grounds that do not have to do with the specific demographics of others.

Our statistical trend lines again show a correlation, this time with higher R-squared and P-values than when looking strictly at voting data.

Linear regression values for this view:

R-squared: .0842313

T-Value: 2.24918

P-Value: .028525

Methodology and Limitations

Raw data and data visualizations can be reviewed here.

Google Trends:

All search volume data came from Google trends. Daily hourly trends data by DMA (Metro Area) was collected from June 1, 2022 to June 19, 2022. Because the data was pulled by hour, aggregate values will likely not match what you see on trends.google.com because the web interface shows daily (not hourly) totals. Hourly data was acquired programmatically using PyTrends for each day in the range. It should be noted that data from Google Trends is on a 1-100 “popularity score” scale which is a comparative score of all 200+ DMAs for which Google Trends provides data. The values in the dataset reflect aggregations of this popularity score, not raw search counts (which Google does not provide).

American Values Atlas:

The American Values Atlas draws upon 50,000 annual telephone interviews among a random sample of Americans to deliver an unprecedented level of detail about the United States’ cultural and religious landscape. With its large sample size, the AVA provides a rare look at the profiles of smaller religious communities, such as Jews, Muslims, Mormons, Hindus, Buddhists, and others, who are often omitted from depictions of the country’s religious population. The AVA’s scope also allows its users to explore the increasing diversity of specific regions, all 50 states, and 30 major metropolitan areas."

Still, the clueless conservative pundit continued to dig himself into a deeper hole.

“There were so many Black people there,” he said. “Sorry to say, but so many Black celebrities who have nothing to do with country music and it’s like — why?”

In typical racist behavior, the talking head tried to prove that he likes some Black people.

Florida restaurant cancels Capitol rioter’s ‘going to prison’ party,https://www.mystateline.com/news/florida-restaurant-cancels-capitol-rioters-going-to-prison-party/,nottheonion,"TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) — A Florida restaurant has canceled plans to host a party for a Parrish man who was convicted in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot.

WFLA confirmed that Caddy’s Bradenton Island, a popular waterfront restaurant located in Bradenton, Florida, canceled a “going to prison” party hosted by rioter Adam Johnson after a Facebook post for the event gained attention on social media.

“Come help me celebrate my last Friday of freedom before I go to prison for the lamest charge in history,” the page reads.

Johnson made national headlines when he was photographed carrying House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s lectern after entering restricted Capitol grounds on Jan. 6.

He pleaded guilty to entering and remaining in a restricted building in November and was sentenced in February to 75 days in prison.

The restaurant’s manager told WFLA that Johnson had indeed scheduled the event, but they decided to cancel the party due to the attention it’s drawing.

The event, called “Adam’s going to prison!”, was still live on Facebook as of Friday, with 41 people saying they planned to go.

Over 770 people in nearly all 50 states and Washington, D.C., have been arrested in connection with the Jan. 6 riot, The Hill reported."

The man, identified only by his surname, Hu, and a partner were collecting pine nuts on Sunday in a forest park in Heilongjiang province in northeastern China when they lost control and the balloon sailed off.

The other person jumped to the ground, and a search was launched for the escaped balloon and Hu.

State broadcaster CCTV said rescuers were able to contact the man by cellphone the following morning and instructed him to slowly deflate the balloon to land safely. It took another day before he reached the ground about 200 miles to the northeast in Fangzheng region, close to the border with Russia.

Hu was in good health, apart from a pain in his lower back, possibly from standing the entire time he was in the air, CCTV said.

An official who gave only his surname, Fu, at the publicity department of the Hailin Forestry Administration Co. on Thursday confirmed the balloon incident and described Hu as being in his 40s. He said Hu was recovering in a hospital but declined to give further details.

Pine nuts are found inside pine cones and are a frequent ingredient in dishes served in the northeast, formerly known as Manchuria."

"$5M in ancient art at Dallas Museum of Art destroyed by man ""mad at his girl,"" police say",https://www.fox7austin.com/news/dallas-museum-of-art-break-in-art-damaged,nottheonion,"A 21-year-old man who police said broke into the Dallas Museum of Art, destroying $5 million worth of ancient artifacts, reportedly said he did it because he was ""mad at his girl.""

This happened just before 10 p.m. Wednesday, when a spokeswoman for the museum said someone ""forcibly entered"" the museum.

Police later identified the suspect as Brian Hernandez, who was taken into custody shortly after leaving the scene. He has been charged with criminal mischief.

Dallas police said he evaded security guards at the museum, smashed glass casings, and destroyed ancient Greek items, at least one of which was from 450 BC.

The Dallas Museum of Art is still open to the public, but certain parts are closed due to the damage.

Many who went to the museum Thursday didn’t know what happened until they arrived.

""Honestly, it’s really saddening. I am a big fan of the DMA, it has such historical art. It’s a tragic event to the whole Dallas community and we hope they can recover,"" Amail Beimenec said.

Court documents state that surveillance cameras caught a man with a ""metal chair"" in his hand at the door.

Shortly after a 9-1-1 call from inside the museum, the dispatcher told investigators the person admitted he broke in.

""It was someone that seemed to be angry, and his purpose was to get his anger exercised with the smashing, anything that he could find of glass,"" said Agustin Arteaga, who is with the Dallas Museum of Art.

The responding security guard told police he asked Hernandez why he broke, and Hernandez's alleged response was that he was mad at his girl so he broke in and started destroying property.

The most expensive items destroyed were a sixth-century Greek vase and a red figure pyxis that dates back to 450 BC.

""He went through other spaces and did not hurt any other works, didn't touch anything, didn't have the intention of stealing anything,"" Arteaga said. ""It was just his anger that drove that person to do what it did.""

Arteaga said the alleged ""girl"" Hernandez was mad at is not an employee or associated with the museum.

""We don't have any connection that we know of, or that person, related to the DMA,"" Arteaga added.

RELATED: Mona Lisa attacked with cake by man disguised as older woman in wheelchair

Recently, a man protesting climate change threw a cake at the Mona Lisa on display at the Louvre Museum in Paris.

The frame protected the actual painting from being damaged.

Arteaga said there has never been any real damage to the Dallas Museum of Art, until now.

""This is something that we've seen recently on a different level, you know, the Mona Lisa being attacked at the Louvre. But we have a marvelous record of 120 years when we never suffer any kind of situation like this,"" he said.

Museum officials think this was just a man acting out.

Other items, like a laptop and glass cases, were also destroyed."
"'Kiss my balls’: inmate's insult to prison guards not a threat, judge rules",https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/kiss-balls-inmates-insult-prison-guards-threat-judge-rules.990962,nottheonion,"An inmate telling prison guards to “kiss my balls” during an outburst in jail did not amount to a threat, so the prisoner could not be found guilty of threatening them or of trying to influence them in their duties, a judge has ruled.

Madam Justice Consuelo Scerri Herrera was ruling on an appeal filed by troublesome inmate Joseph Zahra, 68, who has had countless brushes with the law, including a recent one where he threatened a magistrate during a hearing.

Zahra, of Żurrieq, has a criminal record once described in court as being “as thick as a book”. He has been in and out of jail since he was 18, so he is a well-known figure at Corradino Correctional Facility.

Joseph Zahra leaving the courts after another case in March 2022.

The insult he uttered in jail was directed at two correctional officers during a visit to Division 6 by former prisons director Alex Dalli in July 2018.

Zahra hurled offensive remarks at Dalli, saying he was “full of shit”, told him and other correctional officers to “fuck off” and then told the two officers to “kiss my balls”.

The judge said that, although offensive and vulgar, such language could never be taken to be a threat or an attempt to influence them in their duties.

She, therefore, declared as null the €800 fine imposed by a first court that had found him guilty of the offence.

The last time Zahra was charged in court was in March after he allegedly threatened a member of the judiciary, whose name cannot be published by court order.

'Danger to society'

During that arraignment, the police described him as “a danger to society” with a 47-page criminal record whose offences go back to 1963. They said he had appeared before every possible member of the judiciary.

The magistrate had warned a rowdy Zahra to be quiet but he disobeyed and continued to pass snide remarks, prompting the magistrate to twice find him guilty of contempt of court and fining him a total of €2,000.

He was eventually thrown out of the courtroom where he continued to be loud, swearing and threatening police officers."

"Cop Gets 4 Years for Selling Fentanyl to Children at School, While On Duty, From His Cruiser",https://slatereport.com/news/former-maine-police-officer-to-be-sentenced-on-14-felony-charges/,nottheonion,"CALAIS (BDN) – A former police officer who was arrested for dealing drugs less than a week after he retired from the Calais Police Department will be sentenced next month on more than a dozen criminal charges.

Jeffrey Bishop, 55, pleaded guilty last month to drug trafficking and furnishing, stealing drugs, and multiple counts of receiving stolen property.

He is scheduled to be sentenced on 14 felony charges in Machias at 8:30 a.m. Oct. 17.

Bishop was arrested in February 2021 after he was seen giving drugs to a 17-year-old girl in the parking lot of Narraguagus High School in Harrington. The drugs, which were inside an unmarked prescription pill bottle and were intended for the girl’s mother, included 27 acetaminophen and hydrocodone pills and three baggies of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid 100 times more potent than heroin, police have said.

When police executed a search warrant at his home a few days later, they found and seized 15 guns that had been reported stolen in Hancock and Washington counties over the previous four years. Two of the recovered guns, both of them police-issued Glock pistols, had been stolen in a 2016 burglary at the Gouldsboro Town Office, where Bishop was previously employed as a police officer.

In all, 35 different charges were filed against Bishop. Of those, 21 charges are being dismissed as part of a plea deal with the state attorney general’s office, including several theft charges related to the guns. Among the charges Bishop pleaded guilty to is a charge of stealing oxycodone that was in possession of the Calais Police Department.

Twelve of the charges Bishop pled guilty to are class B felonies, each of which carries a maximum punishment of 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $10,000. The other two are class C felonies, which each carry a punishment of up to five years behind bars and a $5,000 fine.

Bishop was never charged with burglary in connection with the gun thefts because there wasn’t sufficient evidence to connect him with the break-ins where the firearms had been stolen, Assistant Attorney General John Risler has said.

Prior to the Feb. 1, 2021 incident at Narraguagus High School, Bishop on multiple occasions allegedly gave drugs to the girl’s mother in exchange for what police euphemistically describe in court documents as “a non-monetary form of payment” in his cruiser while he still worked for Calais Police Department.

Defense attorney, Chris Largay of Bangor, couldn’t be reached for comment on his client’s plea deal.

Bishop, a Cherryfield resident, worked in law enforcement in Maine for 25 years before retiring on Jan. 30, 2021 from Calais Police Department.

Prior to that, he served as a police officer in Ellsworth, Gouldsboro, Winter Harbor, Milbridge, Jonesport, Baileyville, and the Washington County Sheriff’s Department. He was fired from the Winter Harbor Police Department in October 2015, though the reason for the firing has not been disclosed. He also worked for more than a year as a corrections officer at the Downeast Correctional Facility state prison in Machiasport.

In 2006, while employed as a deputy with the Washington County Sheriff”s Department, he lost a bid to be the Republican Party nominee for sheriff after the incumbant, Joseph Tibbetts, decided to retire.

Days after the primary loss, Bishop was seen throwing a political opponent’s campaign sign into the Narraguagus River in Cherryfield. He later was convicted of attempted criminal mischief and fined $100. But after months of legal wrangling between his union and the county, he was given a separation agreement and $10,000 in back pay."
New Hong Kong leader John Lee spent $1.1m on election campaign in which he was sole candidate,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/05/new-hong-kong-leader-john-lee-election-campaign-spending-sole-candidate,nottheonion,"Hong Kong’s new chief executive, John Lee, received almost HK$11.3m (US$1.4m) in donations during his election campaign earlier this year, according to official filings released on Monday. Lee had run for the city’s top job in May via a small-circle election in which he was the only candidate.

Lee spent around HK$9m (US$1.1m) of the donations on his campaign, the majority of which were split between advertisements, gatherings, office rent and transportation. The majority of advertising costs, around HK$2m, went to social media advertising, while HK$710,000 of funds allotted for office rent and transportation was spent on security. The unused funds were donated to local charity the Community Chest of Hong Kong, the filing said.

Lee’s social media campaign in the lead-up to his election included Facebook and Instagram posts promoting his candidature for office. Posts included cartoon images featuring quotes and detailing his proposed policies with the tagline “Brother Chiu can help you”, in reference to Lee’s Chinese name Lee Ka-Chiu.

The donations came from 59 pro-Beijing business and community groups, according to local media reports. Lee, who along with 11 other Hong Kong and Chinese officials is under US sanctions for his role in the crackdown on dissent in the former British colony, received the donations in cash, and bought three banknote counters and a safe for the funds.

Beijing overhauled the city’s electoral processes in early 2021, cutting direct representation and introducing a “patriots only” requirement in a move that critics say ensured no candidate could be chosen without the support of the central authorities.

Under the new system, a committee of about 1,500 mostly pro-Beijing business and other stakeholders choose the city’s leader in closed-circle elections from vetted candidates.

Hong Kong’s pro-democracy political opposition has been all but crushed under a national security crackdown since mid-2020, with the overwhelming majority behind bars pending trial, withdrawn from public life or in self-imposed exile.

Lee’s spend on social media advertisements was more than six times that of previous chief executive Carrie Lam’s election campaign in 2017. Lam spent about $300,000 on running her Facebook page during closed-circle elections against two other nominated candidates. Lam in 2017 had raised around HK$18.7m and spent HK$12.5m.

Under Hong Kong’s election laws in 2022, the maximum amount of expenses a chief executive candidate can incur during an election campaign is $17.6m.

Lee’s office did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the donations.

The former security chief, widely seen as a hardliner and staunch Beijing loyalist, was sworn in as Hong Kong’s chief executive on Friday last week by Chinese president Xi Jinping on the 25th anniversary of the city’s handover from British to Chinese rule."
Black Tennessee Mayor Declares April Confederate History Month,https://www.blackenterprise.com/black-tennessee-mayor-declares-april-confederate-history-month/,nottheonion,"Last week, Mayor Curtis Hayes, a Black recipient of an NAACP diversity award, signed a proclamation delegating April Confederate History Month in Livingston, Tennessee.

During the announcement, mayor Hayes was joined by six white members of the Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV).

According to the Daily Mail, there is no party affiliation on record for Mayor Hayes.

While the SCV’s website condemns racism while commemorating the history of the Confederacy, it is clear that the Confederacy fought loud and proud in support of slavery, sought to continue slavery, and left the U.S. after the inauguration of Abraham Lincoln. Southern states saw slavery as a material interest and were heavily dependent on a plantation system of enslaved Africans to pick cotton. The Confederacy suspected President Lincoln would free the slaves, which he ultimately did.

Tennessee joins a larger body of states already commemorating the Confederacy. According to News4Jax, Apr. 26 legally remained Confederate Memorial Day in Florida last year. Georgia removed the holiday from its official state calendar in 2016 after the Charleston, S.C. church shooting—though it remains a state holiday.

Forbes reported state offices closing in observance of Confederate Memorial Day in Alabama, South Carolina, and Mississippi in 2021. Gov. Tate Reeves removed the Confederate battle symbol from the Mississippi state flag in 2020. Yet, the Republican governor observed the Confederate holiday this year.

The declaration came amid efforts to retire other Confederate emblems in the U.S. Former Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam brought down a 21-foot statue of Confederate Army Gen. Robert E. Lee in 2020. The monument was removed shortly after the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. A time capsule was also replaced and filled with artifacts, including a Black Lives Matter sticker and an outdated vial of a COVID-19 vaccine. Gov. Northam said, “This was a long time coming, part of the healing process so Virginia can move forward and be a welcoming state with inclusiveness and diversity.”

While 73 Confederate symbols were removed in the U.S. in 2021, 723 remain.

A lifelong resident of Overton County, Mayor Hayes was elected in 2006. At the time of his re-election, the mayor made note of his ability to understand the people, according to Overton County News.

“Growing up here helps me understand our ways, our needs, and our special place. I always try to do what’s best for the people, and that’s why I have a ‘People-First, Open-Door Policy’ at the City,” Mayor Hayes said.

The Livingston mayor received the NAACP Cookeville Diversity Award on Oct. 23, 2021. Livingston Enterprise reports he did not expect the award. Mayor Hayes stated, “I never would have thought in a million years, first of all, that I would be in a position where I am currently.”"

""I just told him he's lost my trust, he's gonna have to earn it back, and I laid out everything I find is unbecoming. And, you can't just say, 'You can't do this again.' I mean, he's, he's got a lot of members very upset.""

McCarthy said Cawthorn conceded some of his remarks were untrue and ""exaggerated.""

""In the interview, he claims he watched people do cocaine. Then when he comes in he tells me, he says he thinks he saw maybe a staffer in a parking garage from 100 yards away,"" McCarthy said.

""It's just frustrating. There's no evidence behind his statements. And when I sit down with him ... I told him you can't make statements like that, as a member of Congress, that affects everybody else and the country as a whole.""

A spokesman for Cawthorn did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The backdrop: Cawthorn, 26, said he had experienced “sexual perversion” while in Washington during an interview with John Lovell for the ""Warrior Poet Society"" podcast.

Lovell had asked Cawthorn whether ""House of Cards"" was a “fictitious show” or if it was “closer to like a documentary.""

Cawthorn then suggested his fellow lawmakers have invited him to an orgy and done cocaine in front of him.

Several House GOP members were furious upon learning about the interview, and many dared Cawthorn to ""name names"" if he is going to make such damaging allegations.

""Madison’s stuff irritates me because it’s not true,"" Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) told Axios' Andrew Solender. ""He’ll have to either name names or retract it.""

What's next: McCarthy said he plans to wait and see what steps Cawthorn takes to improve before taking further, and more official, action against him."
Elon Musk fan wants to prove Tesla won't run over children by trying to run over child,https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/technology/2022/08/elon-musk-fan-wants-to-prove-tesla-won-t-run-over-children-by-trying-to-run-over-child.html,nottheonion,"The executive summary said it had ""demonstrated conclusively that the software does not avoid the child or even slow down when the child is in plain view"".

""A Tesla Model 3 equipped with full self-driving software repeatedly struck the child mannequin in a manner that would be fatal to an actual child. The software is a demonstrable danger to human life and must be removed from the market immediately,"" it concluded.

The Dawn Project, founded by software entrepreneur and Musk critic Dan O'Dowd, shared raw video footage of its test car mowing down the mannequin multiple times.

However, Qazi says the video simply doesn't match the performance of the Tesla that he witnesses every day.

He asked his nearly 130,000 followers whether anyone in the Bay Area would volunteer their child to ""make a point"".

""I promise I won't run them over... (will disengage if needed),"" he continued, indicating that he would take control of the car if he felt there was any danger.

Qazi said The Dawn Project's members were afraid of being exposed as liars.

""If it's really true that it doesn't stop for children, that needs to be fixed. But that's not the experience I've had with it.""

He continued, addressing some of the backlash he had received for wanting to try it out with a real child.

""A lot of very stupid people seem to think I'm going to murder someone,"" he tweeted, before sharing nine reasons why the child wound't be harmed.

That included the test being performed at just 5m/h and the driver being the father of the child.

""100,000 cars are running this every day. It is interacting with millions of pedestrians including kids,"" said Qazi.

""If there is a problem, it needs to be documented immediately. If there isn't, the liars there need to be called out and exposed for trying to kill people for money.""

He then kept attacking his critics, telling them there was ""no need to shit your britches"".

""This is very serious to me. It is not a joke and it is not 'for fun'.

""We plan to run over the child on Saturday,"" he concluded.

Qazi, who regularly tweets at Musk and uses derogatory terms to refer to critics of the billionaire, has also picked up a mannequin to be used as part of the test.

He also retweeted suggestions that the testing was part of a conspiracy against the Tesla CEO.

""The fact that Dan O'Dowd posted videos of Teslas 'mowing down [fake] children' the same day that Taylor Ogan posted a similar video and Ralph Nader released a statement saying FSD should be banned is not a coincidence,"" Qazi claimed.

Former Presidential candidate Nader has called on the US travel safety agency to recall Tesla's FSD feature, calling it ""one of the most dangerous and irresponsible actions by a car company in decades""."
Kardashians Accused Of Using Disability Pass &amp; Shutting Down Disneyland Rides To Bypass Waiting In Line,https://www.yourtango.com/entertainment/video-kardashians-shutting-down-disneyland-ride,nottheonion,"The Kardashians are facing criticism after a recent trip to Disneyland during which the famous family appeared to shut down rides while other customers waited.

Fans have criticized the family online and accused them of using disability passes to avoid the long waits at the theme park.

A TikTok video shows the Kardashians shutting down a Disneyland ride.

A patron who was present on the same day that Kim and Khloe Kardashian took their children to the park filmed the reality TV stars taking selfies on a teacup ride while all the other seats remained empty.

""When the Kardashians cut the line, get the ride to themselves and make us common folk wait... typical,"" the woman wrote in the now-viral video.

Customers are seen snapping photos of the famous family while waiting for them to finish on the ride.

In the comments of the video, many were quick to slam the family for using their “privilege” and criticized Disney for allowing them to do so.

However, some pointed out that they may be paying thousands for this perk as a safety precaution.

“Why is everyone so salty, they are with their children. This is just for their protection,” one user wrote.

Elsewhere, fans accused Khloe Kardashian of using a disability pass to skip lines.

In a Reddit post, a fan shared a screenshot of Khloe’s Instagram story in which a blue tag is seen attached to a stroller that her daughter, True, is sitting in.

It is unclear exactly what the tag is being used for but, on Reddit, some claimed it is a disability access pass.

Disneyland makes several accommodations for patrons with disabilities, one of which is an access service that doesn’t allow people to skip waiting in line entirely but does allow guests to request a return time so they can go elsewhere and still return to the ride without having to stand in line.

It seems unclear what exactly guests need to provide to “prove” that they have a disability. Some Reddit users claimed medical certificates are required, others said Disneyland doesn’t ask for any proof.

Online, guests are required to prebook access passes but little detail is given about what is needed to do so.

Other fans suggested that the pass is simply a tag used to allow guests to bring their own strollers, something Disneyland typically doesn’t allow.

Many were also quick to defend the famous family, pointing out that we don’t actually know whether or not any of their children have a disability, nor is it any of our business.

“We don’t know what any of the children or adults have going on medically. So, not good to speculate about health conditions,” one user wrote.

Others pointed out that while the family was definitely getting some perks, this is also necessary for the safety of everyone in the park.

“VIP is a privilege but also a security concern,” one user wrote, noting that leaving the family out in the open could cause a stampede.

“With their level of celebrity it’s necessary I think to keep them moving along.”

5-year-old basset hound elected mayor of Colorado town,https://www.abc15.com/news/national/5-year-old-basset-hound-elected-mayor-of-colorado-town,nottheonion,"LITTLETON, Colo. — It only took newly elected Mayor Kyle Schlachter a few days to realize that he wasn't the only top dog in politics in Littleton.

""They didn't ask me about it,"" Schlachter told Denver7.

A few days into his term as mayor, the first time the voters directly elected a mayor in Littleton, Schlachter learned that he wouldn't be the only one in the city with that title.

""We weren't electing a human,"" said Katherine Roxborough of Historic Littleton Inc. ""The candidates were of the canine sort.""

Littleton was set to elect its first honorary dog mayor. It was a contest to bring attention to historic preservation within the city.

""We wanted to heighten awareness,"" Roxborough said.

Each dog candidate posed for photos in front of historic sites in Littleton. Voters responded, casting a total of more than 6,000 votes. In the end, the winner was Murdoch, a 5-year-old basset hound.

""He's a lover of people,"" owner Beverly Pillow said. ""And he loves to give big slobbery kisses.""

The 6,000-vote total was nearly half as many votes as the actual mayoral election.

""They had a shorter campaign cycle,"" actual Mayor Schlachter said. ""If they had gone the same length that we did, who knows how many votes the dogs would've gotten.""

Schlachter sat down with Denver7 to discuss his canine counterpart, including if he was ever worried about the ""other"" mayor.

""I feel confident,"" he said. ""Thankfully, this new dog only has a two-year term. I have a four-year term.""

Meanwhile, Mayor Murdoch is out and about in the community every day (on his daily walk). He shakes hands with almost every constituent that stops him.

""That's the only trick he knows,"" owner Beverly said with a smile, giving Murdoch the command and rewarding him with a treat.

The new mayor also didn't come alone. He was elected alongside his dog mayor pro tem, a French bulldog named Netty.

"Christopher Key, urine drinking Alabama anti-vaxxer, says he doesn’t need driver’s license: ‘I am a free man’",https://www.al.com/news/2022/01/christopher-key-urine-drinking-alabama-anti-vaxxer-says-he-doesnt-need-drivers-license-i-am-a-free-man.html,nottheonion,"An Alabama anti-vaxxer who recently suggested urine as a COVID cure now says that he doesn’t need a driver’s license to operate his car as it’s his “wagon, with wagon wheels.”

Christopher Key, founder of “Vaccine Police,” told The Daily Beast on Monday that you only drive if you are “committing commerce.”

Key, who is currently on a cross-country road trip attempting to arrest various Democratic governors, added that because he’s traveling, he doesn’t need a license.

“I travel,” Key said. “My car is not a car. My car is my wagon, with wagon wheels.”

The car, which he showed off on his Telegram account, is currently wrapped with various anti-vax imagery.

Key also said that the only people that needed driver’s licenses are people like truck drivers and Uber drivers.

When asked if he was worried about getting pulled over for not having a license, Key told the outlet that he wasn’t worried.

“I am a free man living on the land. There is no crime,” he said.

Earlier this month, Key suggested that drinking urine cures COVID-19, something that has no scientific evidence.

“The antidote that we have seen now, and we have tons and tons of research, is urine therapy,” Key said in the video earlier this month. “I know to a lot of you this sounds crazy, but guys, God’s given us everything we need.”

That video came on the heels of his arrest after a recent court appearance, in which he refused to both wear a mask and stop recording inside of the courtroom.

Key’s accounts on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram have been suspended or taken down, according to the outlet.

Key’s accounts have been taken down by other social media outlets like YouTube, which announced back in September that they’d be removing all anti-vax videos and accounts spreading misinformation."
Republicans introduce 'HUNTER' Act to ban taxpayer funds for crack pipes,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republicans-hunter-act-taxpayer-funds-crack-pipes,nottheonion,"EXCLUSIVE: A pair of Republican lawmakers authored new legislation to ban federal taxpayer dollars from funding crack pipes, needles and other drug paraphernalia, following a firestorm over a viral report that alleged the Biden administration would be funding crack pipes for addicts.

Reps. Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Dan Bishop of North Carolina said in an exclusive joint interview with Fox News Digital that the Biden administration got caught ""red-handed"" trying to fund crack pipes as part of a $30 million grant program and that legislation is needed to stop the ""ridiculous"" proposal. The White House has denied the grant would fund crack pipes.

""Congressman Bishop and I are standing up and saying, heck no,"" Boebert said. ""Our tax dollars should not be funding the death and destruction of crack addicts. Democrats are always putting the American taxpayer last and Republicans just want to give people in need a good job. Democrats want to give them crack pipes.""

Hunter Act by Fox News on Scribd

They've introduced the Halting the Use of Narcotics Through Effective Recovery Act this week, dubbing the bill the HUNTER Act, in reference to President Biden's son, Hunter Biden, who has openly struggled with drug addiction.

""I like the HUNTER Act,"" Boebert said in an interview, ""because it was a better acronym than Stop Paying to Subsidize Biden's Son’s Drug Addiction act. That didn't really flow. I think tax dollars have been on the hook for Hunter’s addictions long enough.""

Bishop also took aim at more progressive drug policies such as safe injection sites, needle trade-ins, and safe smoking kits. He said such programs try to ""remove all stigma"" from drug use, when ""actually stigma is not a bad thing.""

LIBERAL OUTLETS, FACT-CHECKERS GO TO WAR OVER FREE BEACON REPORT ON BIDEN FUNDING 'CRACK PIPE' DISTRIBUTION

""The HUNTER Act is a means of encapsulating how ridiculous public policy can become when it's in the hands of the woke,"" Bishop said.

The hubbub over crack pipes originated from a $30 million new ""harm reduction"" grant proposal the Biden administration announced through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), which is a branch of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

The stated purpose of the program funded through the Democrats' American Rescue Plan is to prevent overdose deaths and reduce health risks associated with drug use. A list of supplies that can be purchased with the grant funds included overdose reversal medications, safe-sex kits with condoms, fentanyl test strips, syringes, as well as ""Safe smoking kits/supplies,"" according to grant documents.

The Washington Free Beacon reported that such kits will provide pipes for users to smoke crack cocaine, crystal methamphetamine and ""any illicit substance.""

The outlet acknowledged an HHS spokesman declined to specify what is included in the smoking kits. It also mentioned other efforts to distribute safe smoking kits didn't provide pipes, but mouthpieces to prevent glass cuts, rubber bands to prevent burns and filters to minimize the risk of disease.

The paper has stood by its crack pipe reporting, despite pushback from the Biden administration.

Both HHS and the White House quickly put out statements in response saying the grant funds wouldn't go to crack pipes.

HHS SEC. BECERRA SAYS CRACK PIPES WON'T BE DISTRIBUTED USING FEDERAL FUNDS IN SMOKING KITS

HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra's Wednesday statement made clear that no pipes would be put into ""safe smoking kits.""

In a press release, Becerra and Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) Director Dr. Rahul Gupta said the administration was ""focused on using our resources smartly to reduce harm and save lives. Accordingly, no federal funding will be used directly or through subsequent reimbursement of grantees to put pipes in safe smoking kits.""

And White House press secretary Jen Psaki has called the crack pipe story ""misinformation.""

""They were never a part of the kit; it was inaccurate reporting,"" Psaki said of the crack pipes. ""And we wanted to put out information to make that clear.""

She said safe smoking kits may include ""alcohol swabs, lip balm, other materials to promote hygiene and reduce the transmission of diseases like HIV and hepatitis.""

The White House declined to comment on the ""HUNTER Act.""

But Boebert and Bishop said they weren't taking the White House's word and want legislation to ensure no drug supplies are funded.

""Whenever they are caught red-handed they use the phrase misinformation or disinformation to stop the American people from calling them out,"" Bishop said. ""That’s what happening.""

""We want that in statute,"" Boebert added. ""We're not taking their word for it.""

The House legislation follows a Senate bill, known as the Cutting off Rampant Access to Crack Kits (CRACK) Act. GOP Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida, Tim Scott of South Carolina, John Kennedy of Louisiana and several other Republicans fired off the bill Thursday to block American Rescue Plan funds from funding the purchase and distribution of drug paraphernalia to drug users.

Meanwhile, the Biden administration is catching heat from the left for saying it won't fund crack pipes in the kits.

The liberal nonprofit group Drug Policy Alliance said the decision ""to remove pipes from safe smoking equipment is deeply disappointing. This is a missed opportunity to be preventative of more deaths due to overdose.""

The group on Twitter highlighted the reality that ""people do drugs"" and said ""removing access to clean equipment doesn’t stop people from using drugs. It makes it more risky."""
"After ruling, TN universities must remove references that Title IX law protects LGBTQ+",https://wreg.com/news/nation-and-world/after-ruling-tn-universities-must-remove-references-that-title-ix-law-protects-lgbtq/,nottheonion,"This is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.

KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (WATE)- Public universities across the State of Tennessee received a letter from State Representative John Ragan of Oak Ridge advising the institutions to remove references to LGBTQI people being a “protected class” under the federal Title IX law from public-facing materials, including websites.

There are about a dozen public colleges and universities in Tennessee who received Ragan’s letter. The University Of Tennessee said they responded to Ragan through their own letter. Ragan said he’s waiting on several other schools to do the same.

When Title IX was first signed into law in 1972, it prohibited discrimination on the basis of sex in any education program or activity that receives federal financial assistance.

U.S. Department of Education had proposed changing the wording of Title IX to include members of the LGBTQ+ community, but those changes were blocked by an East Tennessee U.S. District Court judge in July. Any school with the phrasing referring to Title IX is going against state law, Ragan said.

“They are charted and funded by the State of Tennessee,” Ragan explained. “So obviously they [educational institutions who include LGBTQ+ in Title IX] are risking that in that sense by not following state law.”

The University of Tennessee responded to Ragan’s letter, saying in part, “it did not modify its publications, policies, or websites relating to Title IX in response to either the June 23, 2021 letter from the U.S. Department of Education or the injunction issued on July 15, 2022, by the federal district court.”

The school goes on to say in their letter,

“We do not believe anything in our current policies, procedures, or statements relating to title IX or nondiscrimination violates either federal or state law.”

Ragan said not all universities have replied in the same manner.

“Universities are not at liberty to ignore state law, regardless of their accreditation or certification organizations say they most have to get their accreditation. These are not governmental entities, and as such universities must follow state law over and above what these organizations tell them.”

The ruling can still be appealed by a higher court, but until that happens or until a judge lifts the injunction, Ragan said, all public schools must comply with the request."

‘I’d eat an Indian’: rivals seize on unearthed Bolsonaro cannibalism boast,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/09/brazil-jair-bolsonaro-cannibalism-boast,nottheonion,"It was a shocking statement, even for a politician who has glorified torturers and called for rivals to be shot.

“I’d eat an Indian, no problem at all,” Jair Bolsonaro bragged to a foreign journalist in 2016, as he described a trip to an Indigenous community where he had purportedly been offered the chance to consume human flesh.

Indigenous leaders have rejected Bolsonaro’s boast as yet another lie from Brazil’s far-right president. The Yanomami people from the territory Bolsonaro claims to have visited say they have never engaged in such acts.

However, footage of Bolsonaro’s cannibalism comments – first broadcast on his official YouTube channel six years ago – has gone viral on social media and been seized on by Brazil’s opposition as further proof of the president’s depravity.

“Bolsonaro has revealed that he would eat human flesh,” a television advert produced by Bolsonaro’s leftist rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, declared on Friday after the remarks were unearthed.

Lula nearly beat Bolsonaro in the first round of Brazil’s presidential election last Sunday and hopes to finish the job when 156 million Brazilians vote in a second-round showdown between the two men on 30 October.

In its efforts to re-elect Lula, Brazil’s president from 2003 to 2010, his campaign has dug deep into Bolsonaro’s extensive back catalogue of callous and inflammatory pronouncements.

One recent Lula advert shows Bolsonaro shoving a female politician and calling her a “bitch”. In another scene the rightwinger mocks Covid victims and pretends to be gasping for air.

But Friday’s campaign ad was perhaps the most shocking to date.

Bolsonaro’s communications minister, Fábio Faria, called Lula’s advert “fake news” and claimed the comments had been distorted. Bolsonaro’s lawyers demanded electoral authorities ban the ad.

An analysis of the full 76-minute interview with the New York Times journalist Simon Romero leaves little doubt about the nature of Bolsonaro’s remarks.

After describing the destitution he witnessed during a visit to Haiti, Bolsonaro moves from discussing “unhygienic” Haitian women offering sex to making claims about cannibalism allegedly being perpetrated in the Amazon’s Yanomami territory.

“There was this time I was in Surucuru … and an Indian had died and they were cooking him. They cook Indians. It’s their culture,” Bolsonaro claims to the correspondent’s apparent befuddlement.

“Their bodies?” the journalist replies.

“Their bodies,” Bolsonaro confirms.

“But not to eat?” the journalist asks.

“Yes, to eat,” answers Bolsonaro, then an obscure congressman. “They cook it for two or three days and then eat it with banana. I wanted to see an Indian being cooked but the guy said if you go, you have to eat it. ‘I’ll eat it,’ I said. But no one else in my group wanted to go … so I didn’t go. But I’d eat an Indian, no problem at all. It’s their culture.”

Yanomami leaders and anthropologists denounced Bolsonaro’s “delirious” and prejudiced claims. “My people aren’t cannibals … This doesn’t exist nor has it ever existed, not even among our ancestors,” the Yanomami activist Júnior Yanomami told the Folha de São Paulo newspaper.

“Bolsonaro is a compulsive liar,” tweeted Sônia Guajajara, an Indigenous leader who has just been elected to congress.

Lula denied spreading misinformation. “I saw the footage … It’s no invention, we’re simply letting people know what our opponent is like,” he told supporters, claiming foreigners were shunning Brazil “for fear of the cannibal”.

On Saturday a preliminary ruling from an electoral judge ordered Lula’s Workers’ party (PT) to withdraw an advert that risked damaging Bolsonaro’s reputation and affecting “the integrity of the electoral process”. The judge argued that Bolsonaro’s remarks “referred to a specific experience in an Indigenous community, lived according to the values and morality existing in this society”.

The decision appeared to close the stable door after the horse had bolted. By Sunday, social media was awash with mentions of “Cannibal Bolsonaro” and memes likening the president to Hannibal Lecter and the serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer. The footage of Bolsonaro’s declaration had been seen millions of times."

Tropicana creates cereal to be mixed specifically with orange juice,https://www.econotimes.com/Tropicana-creates-cereal-to-be-mixed-specifically-with-orange-juice-1632190,nottheonion,"Tropicana will release a cereal specifically intended to mix with orange juice instead of milk, in honor of National Orange Juice Day on May 4.

Dubbed the Tropicana Crunch, it is touted as ""the first-ever breakfast cereal created to pair with Tropicana Pure Premium.

TropicanaCrunch.com will be the only place to get the odd cereal. Starting on May 4, the juice company will give away boxes for free while supplies last.

Tropicana Crunch is described on the box as a ""honey almond cereal,"" and the website claims that it has honey almond clusters.

After experimenting with various flavors and textures, Tropicana decided on a granola-based cereal because it can resist the acidity in OJ better than flakes, which would become soggy more rapidly.

The honey almond flavor was chosen to counteract the tartness of the orange juice.

Tropicana has taken a bold attempt to address some of orange juice's perceived faults for the second time in the last year with the orange juice matching cereal. Tropicana Toothpaste was produced last year as a limited-edition giveaway of a toothpaste that was specifically designed to keep your orange juice tasting good after brushing your teeth."

"Weird: The Al Yankovic Story Involved 'Absolutely No Research on Al's Actual Life,' Director Says",https://www.moviemaker.com/weird-the-al-yankovic-story-no-research-director-eric-appel/,nottheonion,"When you watch Weird: The Al Yankovic Story, don’t expect it to give you the factual story of Weird Al’s life. Actually, don’t expect it to be even remotely true. Making the film involved “absolutely no research on Al’s actual life,” director Eric Appel told MovieMaker last week after the movie played as the opening night film of the Newport Beach Film Festival.

Instead, his and Yankovic’s aim was to completely parody the biopic genre, just like Yankovic would parody a song.

“It was basically us taking like all of our favorite tropes from biopics and just — it’s really satirizing the entire biopic genre. Not just rock biopics, like The Doors or Walk The Line or Bohemian Rhapsody. It’s also Boogie Nights and Forrest Gump, like fictional biopics as well,” Appel said. “They all sort of follow the same storytelling template, and it was us kind of deconstructing that and then putting it back together in the most weird, surprising way.”

Yankovic himself plays record executive Tony Scotti in the movie alongside Will Forte as Ben Scotti and Daniel Radcliffe as Weird Al. Julianne Nelson plays Yankovic’s mother and Toby Huss plays his father. Rainn Wilson plays Dr. Demento, Evan Rachel Wood plays Madonna, and Arturo Castro plays Pablo Escobar, with tons of smaller appearances from some of Yankovic’s friends including Jack Black, Conan O’Brien, Patton Oswalt, and Lin-Manuel Miranda.

The movie started as a fake trailer that Appel made as a joke, with Yankovic’s permission, when he worked at Funny or Die. It starred Aaron Paul as Yankovic and Olivia Wilde as Madonna. For many years, Yankovic would show the trailer at his concerts, prompting fans to ask when he was going to make it into a real movie — until he actually did.

“After a decade of people coming up to him after concerts and saying, ‘How can I see this biopic?’ it sort of started wearing on him. And then, I think it was [when] Bohemian Rhapsody had just come out, and Rocket Man was about to come out, and they had announced the Elvis movie, the Aretha Franklin movie, and it was a whole slew of biopics. It was like, okay, I think that people are into biopics again, they’re back in the zeitgeist. They sort of disappeared for a little while after Walk The Line and there was a lapse for like a decade, and now they’re back in full force.”

Weird: The Al Yankovic Story will begin streaming on The Roku Channel on Nov. 4.

"Marines, sailors ate all of Greek town’s eggs, meat on port visit",https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-marine-corps/2022/08/22/marines-sailors-ate-all-of-greek-towns-eggs-meat-on-port-visit/,nottheonion,"A Greek town was left scrambled after Marines ate all of the city’s eggs and meat and overindulged on tattoos during a recent training exercise visit with the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit.

Marines and sailors visiting the northeastern military port city of Alexandroupoli, Greece, put their appetites to work this past May, as reported by the outlet Greek Reporter in July and later by Task & Purpose, overwhelming local business owners.

“Yesterday, 1,500 people had breakfast in Alexandroupolis and ate eggs, sausages and bacon,” said restaurant owner Giorgos Alavantas, according to Greek City Times. “Yesterday, 6,000–7,000 eggs were needed. In other words, we don’t have eggs.”

Another restaurant owner, Vassilis Siklafidis, told the outlet, “They have gone crazy. They keep telling us that they haven’t eaten nicer meat.”

On May 4, the San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock Arlington, attached to the Kearsarge Amphibious Ready Group, arrived in Greece with the 22nd MEU to participate in a dual U.S.-Greek amphibious training called Alexander the Great 2022, according to a Marine Corps press release.

Lt. Col. Christopher Myette, executive officer of the 22nd MEU, said in a press statement, “The training we executed with our NATO Allies in Greece reinforced the close relationship between our two militaries and provided an outstanding opportunity to learn from each other and hone our warfighting skills in a first class training venue.”

Following the exercise, on May 21 the ship docked in Alexandroupoli, Greece, the statement said.

Capt. Jacoby D. Getty, 22nd MEU spokesman, confirmed that “mass amounts of eggs, steak and tattoos were consumed,” by troops visiting the Greek city.

“The 22 MEU works to continuously boost our relationships with our partners and allies,” Getty said. “That comes with the training we conduct, but also when we come into port. Learning about our partners and allies cultures is important and if we are able to boost their economy on a port visit, that’s great too.”

“Members from the Greece embassy passed to our higher headquarters that the Greek leaders were super pleased with the economic boost and that we enjoyed ourselves.”

Nikos Katsoulis, the owner of a local tattoo studio, told the Greek City Times, Marines “travel all over the world, so tattoos are crucial for them to have a memory when they grow older to say that they passed through Greece and I got this tattoo.”

It is common for Marines to explore the area of their port stops, enjoying the hospitality and contributing to the economy of the local town.

Georgios Davis, former president of the Alexandroupoli hospitality association and grill house owner, as reported by the Greek outlet Kathimerini, said, “I serve 16 different types of meat at my restaurant, and they tried them all. They were very polite, they ate everything.”

The outlet also reported U.S. troops ate more than 25,000 eggs during four days at the Greek port.

Building relationships, via eggs

The military relationship between United States and its NATO partner Greece (which joined in 1952) recently has grown closer in part to the war between Russia and Ukraine.

Greek Minister of Defense Nikolaos Panagiotopoulos visited U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin at the Pentagon in July where they discussed this among other regional issues.

“I want to thank you for the security assistance that Greece is providing to support Ukraine in the face of Russia’s indefensible assault on its peaceful neighbor,” Austin said to the Greek defense minister, according to a DoD transcript.

During their meeting, Austin also discussed the strategic importance of access to the port of Alexandroupoli, Greece ― the named city where troops only a few months earlier were shelling out for the local cuisine.

“That access allows us to continue to provide military assistance to Ukraine and to counter malign actors and exercise and operate in the Balkans and eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea region,” Austin said according to a DoD statement.

The defense secretary, however, did not mention the incident in Alexandroupoli, Greece, or even how he likes his eggs.

Both the war in Ukraine and recent outbreaks of bird flu have caused the price for merely a dozen eggs to skyrocket worldwide.

While it is presumed the Greek town has restocked on its egg supply since May, rising inflation in Greece may have contributed to costly shopping trips post the Marines’ arrival, with the country’s inflation hitting a nearly 30-year record high in June, according to the Greek Reporter. Even as of July, the cost of dairy and eggs was up 16.4%, according to Greek City Times.

Greece may soon have more control over its economy, however, as it was scheduled to leave a monitoring framework by the European Union on Aug. 20, as reported by Reuters.

The unusual situation in Greece for the MEU is not the first time troops have overwhelmed a foreign port city during an overseas exercise.

Back in 2018, U.S. sailors and Marines made news after they drank much of the beer supply in Iceland’s capital.

Following its time in Greece, the Arlington and the 22nd MEU traveled to other port stops in and around Europe.

“Currently the Kearsarge ARG MEU is conducting an exercise with Finnish military personnel ... focusing on interoperability and building relationships with our future NATO allies and partners,” Getty told Marine Corps Times in mid August.

As one Greek reporter who covered the egg incident wrote, “In the northern Greek port city of Alexandroupoli, May 21, 202, will be remembered as the day the ship appeared.”

Lottery: Woman won $10M after accidentally pushing wrong button on vending machine in Tarzana,https://abc7.com/lottery-10-million-scratchers-tarzana/11716971/,nottheonion,"A woman said she purchased a California Lottery Scatchers ticket worth $10 million after a stranger accidentally bumped into her, forcing her to inadvertently push the wrong button on a vending machine.

TARZANA, Calif. (KABC) -- It was a small accident that turned out to be worth millions.

LaQuedra Edwards was at a Vons in Tarzana in November when she put $40 into a California Lottery Scratchers vending machine. As she was about to choose which games she wanted, she said, ""some rude person"" bumped into her.

According to Edwards, the impact of the stranger bumping into her caused her to push a number on the machine that she did not intend. Out came a $30 200X Scratchers ticket -- which she had no intention of buying.

""He just bumped into me, didn't say a thing and just walked out the door,"" Edwards recalled, as described in a news release issued by the California Lottery on Wednesday. She recounted being irritated not only because the person bumped into her, but also because she had spent 75% of her lottery money on one ticket instead of being able to purchase her usual selection of lower-priced favorites.

Edwards returned to her car and began scratching the $30 ticket. That's when she realized she'd won the game's top prize -- a cool $10 million.

""I didn't really believe it at first, but I got on the 405 Freeway and kept looking down at (the ticket) and I almost crashed my car,"" Edwards said, according to the statement. ""I pulled over, looked at it again and again, scanned it with my (California Lottery mobile) app and I just kept thinking, 'This can't be right.'""

""I'm still in shock,"" she added. ""All I remember saying once I found out how much I just won was, 'I'm rich!'""

The supermarket received a $50,000 bonus for selling the winning ticket.

According to the news release, Edwards plans to use her winnings to buy a house and launch a nonprofit organization.

San Francisco building single public toilet that will cost $1.7 million and won't be completed until 2025,https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/san-francisco-building-single-public-toilet-that-will-cost-1-7-million-and-wont-be-completed-until-2025,nottheonion,"article

Local officials were set to gather on Wednesday in San Francisco's Noe Valley Town Square to celebrate their latest win: a single public toilet that will cost as much as $1.7 million to build and won't be completed until 2025.

But the celebration was canceled after a San Francisco Chronicle columnist highlighted the ""mind-boggling"" and ""maddening"" details of the project.

California Assemblyman Matt Haney told the newspaper that he now considers the price tag ""inexplicable.""

""When Rec and Park first told us the number, it sounded shockingly high to me,"" Haney told the San Francisco Chronicle .

""I’m glad that Noe Valley will at some point get a bathroom, but it shouldn’t cost this much, and it shouldn’t take this long, and I’m angry about it. … It’s not something I want to celebrate right now.""

A spokesperson for the San Francisco Recreation and Parks Department told Fox News Digital that the exorbitantly high cost is due to ""onerous demands and unpredictable costs levied by PG&E,"" construction costs that have skyrocketed 20% to 30% in the past two years, and employment of workers who are being paid a living wage with benefits.

""It’s also important to note that public projects and their overall cost estimates don’t just reflect the price of erecting structures,"" the spokesperson said. ""They include the cost of planning, drawing, permits, reviews, public outreach and construction management.""

By the time the toilet is actually completed in 2025, the cost could be less than the $1.7 million price tag, at which point leftover funds will be put toward maintenance and upgrades, according to the parks department.

Regardless, Haney said that his constituents have been asking for a public toilet since the town square opened in 2016. San Francisco's notorious feces problem has been at the top of local officials' minds for years, prompting Mayor London Breed to announce a new public health and safety initiative last December.

Aqua’s ‘Barbie Girl’ Song Won’t Appear in the Margot Robbie ‘Barbie’ Movie,https://variety.com/2022/film/news/barbie-girl-movie-aqua-1235254222/,nottheonion,"“Come on Barbie, let’s go party!” is the immortal refrain from Aqua’s 1997 song “Barbie Girl” but when it comes to the upcoming Margot Robbie movie, Aqua haven’t been invited to join the fun.

Despite fans insisting that the Europop banger – which has clocked up over a billion views on YouTube – should appear in the soundtrack to the Mattel and Warner Bros. film, Variety understands there are no plans for that to happen.

If Barbie Girl by Aqua isn't in the end credits of the Barbie movie I want my money back — TheTatermeister is obsessed w/Minecraft (@TheT8ermeister) April 27, 2022

If Aqua’s “Barbie Girl” doesn’t appear on the Barbie soundtrack… pic.twitter.com/HiVbibfH12 — art tavana (@arttavana) April 27, 2022

“The song will not be used in the movie,” Ulrich Møller-Jørgensen, who manages Aqua lead singer Lene Nystrøm, tells Variety.

Variety has reached out to Warner Bros. for comment.

Although Møller-Jørgensen wouldn’t expand on why the Danish pop band’s mega-hit won’t be sound-tracking “Barbie,” there has previously been bad blood between Aqua and toy company Mattel, who created and own the Barbie brand.

After “Barbie Girl” became a phenomenon in 1997, selling over 1.4 million copies in the U.S. and staying at #1 in the U.K. singles charts for four weeks, Mattel filed a lawsuit against MCA Records (now part of Universal Music), who distributed the track in the U.S., for trademark infringement.

Mattel, who were concerned that the song could harm the wholesome Barbie brand, were unhappy with what they considered to be the track’s suggestive lyrics, describing the song in their filing as being about “a promiscuous Barbie doll sing[ing] in a flirtatious tone” and a “licentious Ken doll respond[ing] `kiss me here, touch me there.'” They also cited a scene in the accompanying music video in which Ken (played by Aqua vocalist René Dif) accidentally pulls off Nystrøm’s arm.

“The video features the Ken doll dismembering the Barbie doll by pulling off her arm,” Mattel complained.

In response, MCA Records said the song was a parody protected by the First Amendment and filed their own lawsuit for defamation over statements that a Mattel spokesperson made during the course of the lawsuit.

“Even if we found the lyrics acceptable, we would be filing this suit because the song was published and distributed without our permission and certainly without our notification,” the spokesperson reportedly said. “They are referring to this song as upbeat and fun, and it’s really our belief that unlawful exploitation of another company’s property for one’s own commercial gain is neither upbeat or fun. It’s theft.”

However, the United States District Court in California dismissed both parties’ claims, declaring “Mattel’s statements were non-actionable hyperbole” and that the song is a parody, “poking fun at both her and the plastic values she represents.”

Mattel attempted to appeal but were met with short shrift. Again dismissing both the trademark infringement and defamation claims, United States Court of Appeals circuit judge Alex Kozinski ruled: “The parties are advised to chill.”

25 years later, it seems Aqua are still out in the cold."
Dad takes down town's internet by mistake to get his kids offline,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/technology/dad-takes-down-towns-internet-by-mistake-to-get-his-kids-offline/,nottheonion,"A French dad faces jail time and a hefty fine after using a signal jammer to prevent his kids from going online and taking the rest of a nearby town down with them.

Starting at midnight and until 3 AM every day of the week, the French town of Messanges found that their cellular and Internet service were no longer working.

After a mobile carrier reported the issue to the Agence nationale des fréquences (ANFR), a public agency responsible for managing the radioelectric spectrum in France, it was determined that a signal jammer was being used to block radio frequencies in the town.

A signal jammer is a device that transmits radio waves on the same frequency as mobile devices to prevent them from connecting to cell towers and receiving legitimate signals.

A report by the ANFR explains that a technician traced the jamming signal to a house in a neighboring town, where a homeowner admitted to purchasing a jammer online and using it to force his teenage kids offline.

""The explanation was disconcertingly simple: the jammer had been installed by the father of the family to prevent his teenagers from accessing the internet with their smartphone instead of falling asleep! His children had indeed become addicted to social networks and other applications, in particular since the confinement imposed due to the epidemic of Covid-19,"" ANFR explained in their report.

""After consulting forums on the internet, the father decided that a jammer was the best solution to put an end to these excesses!""

The jammer seized by ANFR

While it was not the father's intent to take down an entire town's Internet, using a jamming device in France is illegal and carries a penalty of up to a €30,000 fine and 6 months in jail.

Similarly, the use of jammers is illegal in the USA and could lead to imprisonment and significant monetary fines.

""The use or marketing of a jammer in the United States may subject you to substantial monetary penalties, seizure of the unlawful equipment, and criminal sanctions including imprisonment."" explains an FCC enforcement alert about jamming.

The ANFR reported the use of the jammer to the Public Prosecutor's office, who has seized the device and is investigating the offense.

Dentist found guilty of damaging patients’ teeth to boost profits,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/16/wisconsin-dentist-guilty-damaging-patients-teeth-boost-profits,nottheonion,"A Wisconsin dentist was found guilty of healthcare fraud and other charges after he intentionally damaged his patients’ teeth to boost profits, raking in millions from his scheme.

Scott Charmoli, 61, was convicted of five counts of healthcare fraud and two counts of making false claims about his clients’ treatment last Thursday, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

With his sentencing scheduled for June, Charmoli faces up to 10 years for each healthcare fraud charge and a maximum of five years for each of the two other charges.

Prosecutors say that Charmoli had routinely drilled or broken his clients’ teeth on purpose, charging them for additional treatment services to fix the damage he had just done. As a result, Charmoli’s profits ballooned, with the dentist going from making $1.4m and installing 434 crowns in 2014 to $2.5m in 2015, installing over 1,000 crowns, reported the Washington Post.

According to prosecutors, in 2015, Charmoli began pressuring his clients into getting unnecessary crowns, a dental procedure where a tooth-shaped cap is placed on a damaged tooth. Charmoli would drill or break his client’s teeth and send X-rays of the intentional damage to insurance as “before” photos to justify the crown procedures.

One client, Todd Tedeschi, testified that Charmoli pressured him into getting two crowns in one appointment, despite Tedeschi believing that his teeth were fine.

“It seemed excessive, but I didn’t know any better,” said Tedeschi. “He was the professional. I just trusted him.”

Some of the patients that Charmoli badgered into unnecessary procedures were also vulnerable, said prosecutors.

“Some of these patients were extremely vulnerable individuals in abusive relationships, recently widowed, survivors of cancer and living paycheck to paycheck scrounging to afford the co-pays required for the unnecessary procedures he was billing,” said prosecutor Julie Stewart in 2020.

Between 2016 to 2019, Charmoli billed more than $4.2m for crowns, performing more crowns than 95% of dentists in Wisconsin during that time. According to testimony from an insurance company executive, while an average Wisconsin dentist performs fewer than six crowns for every 100 patients, Charmoli’s rate exceeded more than 32 crowns per 100 clients.

By the end of 2020, Charmoli had over $6.8m worth of assets, with vacation homes in Wisconsin and Arizona.

Nearly 100 of Charmoli’s former patients have sued him for medical malpractice, with those cases set to begin once Charmoli’s federal criminal proceedings are over. While Charmoli’s lawyers did not provide comment to the Post following Charmoli’s conviction, his lawyers commented during Charmoli’s December 2020 arraignment, where the dentist pleaded not guilty, saying Charmoli was only guilty of “hard work”.

“He certainly denies that his hard-earned wealth of many, many years of dental practice at the 40 to 60 hour per week range are the product of anything other than his own diligence, hard work and good business acumen,” said defense attorney Nila Robinson at the time.

Charmoli’s schemes were eventually unearthed when he sold his dental practice in 2019. While reviewing his files, the new owners noted the high rate of crown procedures Charmoli had done and reported him to the authorities.

“The health and safety of patients is my highest concern as a doctor. As medical professionals, we take an oath to ‘do no harm’ to our patients, which is why I felt the ethical obligation to report activity that I believed to be suspicious,” wrote the Jackson Family Dentistry owner Pako Major on the practice’s website.

Wisconsin state authorities suspended Charmoli’s dental license in February 2021, pending disciplinary action. Charmoli was first licensed in 1986."
‘No one is immune or exempt’: Sheriff arrests his own daughter for meth trafficking,https://www.ky3.com/2022/04/26/no-one-is-immune-or-exempt-sheriff-arrests-his-own-daughter-meth-trafficking/,nottheonion,"EASTPOINT, Fla. (Gray News) – A recent drug bust for one Florida sheriff is more personal than usual.

“Methamphetamine does not discriminate and neither do we,” Franklin County Sheriff A.J. Smith wrote in a post on the department’s Facebook page. “It does not matter who you are, no one is immune or exempt.”

The sheriff’s office conducted a narcotics investigation which led to the arrest of 38-year-old Kristen Kent and 25-year-old Bailey Adaire Lee on April 18.

The sheriff’s office charged Kent with trafficking methamphetamine 14 grams or over, drug equipment possession and/or use and cocaine possession. Lee was charged with two counts of trafficking methamphetamine 14 grams or over.

Smith later confirmed to The Miami Herald that Kent is his daughter.

“When you work in law enforcement, do not take things personally,” the sheriff wrote in a Facebook post a few days later. “There will be many challenging situations that you will face and you must rise above.”

The sheriff is known for cracking down on meth trafficking in his jurisdiction, and the sheriff’s department operates with the motto “We don’t meth around.”

The sheriff said he learned his daughter was involved in the trafficking when asked who sold the drugs.

Although he doesn’t take things personally as a part of his job, Smith told the Herald this news was “gut-wrenching.”

“Our hearts break over the grief meth causes all,” the sheriff’s Facebook post reads. “Whether you use it, sell it or love someone who is involved with it. If you want to break free from this lifestyle, we want to help you. Call Shannon at 850-653-5775.”

Batgirl Movie Will Reportedly Never Be Released Because It Was Just That Bad,https://www.escapistmagazine.com/batgirl-movie-not-release-canceled-wb-warner-bros/,nottheonion,"From the studio that actually released Catwoman, Batman v Superman, and basically most of the rest of the DCEU comes the news that there is, in fact, a film so bad that it will not release it. The New York Post (via The Wrap) is reporting that Warner Bros. Discovery, which is new management since Batgirl was greenlit, has no plans to release the movie in theaters or on HBO Max, where it was originally intended to land. (Update: Variety is confirming the movie will not be released, but it says it has to do with studio direction as opposed to film quality.)

Batgirl has had a troubled road since it was first announced as an HBO Max film. The movie was in the hands of Joss Whedon at one point but after his downfall got moved around until Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah (Bad Boys for Life) were given the go-ahead to make the movie. Leslie Grace was cast as Batgirl and the plan was to introduce the character into DC’s multiverse, even having Michael Keaton play Batman/Bruce Wayne in the film. The movie was originally intended to be a lower-budget affair, but thanks to the creative changes and COVID breaks the budget reportedly grew to $90 million. While that number isn’t huge for a theatrical superhero film, it was well over what one would expect for an HBO Max release.

The reports find that, despite Batgirl being nearly complete and the studio loving both the directors and Grace, the movie won’t be seeing the light of day. The Wrap states that studio leadership believes the movie just “did not work,” and the New York Post claims test screenings went badly enough that there was a fear it could cause brand damage. The Wrap further elaborates that the studio’s new leadership wants to make sure that DC movies are all big-budget theatrical films moving forward. Of course, this is in stark contrast to Marvel, which has dropped a plethora of superhero series on Disney+ at or above the quality of its cinematic films.

Barring some future reversal, it seems that the Batgirl movie is a victim of a studio leadership change. One wonders what this could mean for the future of the Blue Beetle movie as well, which star Cobra Kai‘s Xolo Maridueña as Jaime Reyes and is currently slated for a theatrical release."
"Musk cited possible “World War III” as reason to break Twitter deal, text shows",https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/09/musk-cited-possible-world-war-iii-as-reason-to-break-twitter-deal-text-shows/,nottheonion,"Two weeks after Elon Musk made a commitment to buy Twitter for $44 billion, he wrote in a May 8 text message to one of his Morgan Stanley bankers that he was thinking of exiting the merger agreement due to the possibility of World War III.

""Let's slow down just a few days. Putin's speech tomorrow is really important. It won't make sense to buy Twitter if we're heading into World War III,"" Musk wrote to Morgan Stanley's head of global technology investment banking, Michael Grimes. Twitter lawyer Bill Savitt read the text out in a court hearing yesterday, multiple news reports said. In the May 9 speech, Russian President Vladimir Putin defended his invasion of Ukraine. The invasion began in February, two months before Musk's April 25 agreement to buy Twitter.

While Twitter called the Musk text a ""money quotation,"" Musk lawyer Alex Spiro ""said the characterization of the texts in court was 'utter nonsense as the full text chain shows.' The full text chain is expected to be filed on the court docket next week,"" Business Insider wrote. Spiro also ""responded by saying that any businessman would be anxious about the impact of a potential war on the stock market,"" The Wall Street Journal wrote.

Twitter's lawsuit against Musk argued that he had no right to exit the deal and that he tried to pull out because ""the value of Musk's stake in Tesla, the anchor of his personal wealth, has declined by more than $100 billion from its November 2021 peak."" Musk agreed to seller-friendly terms with ""no financing contingency and no diligence condition,"" the lawsuit said. Advertisement

Musk can’t delay trial, judge rules

The text from Musk to Grimes was read during a pre-trial hearing in the Delaware Court of Chancery, perhaps offering a preview of arguments to be made in the trial scheduled to begin on October 17. Of more immediate importance, Twitter and Musk lawyers argued over Musk's request to delay the trial by a month and Musk's request to amend his countersuit to include whistleblower allegations made by Twitter's former security chief.

Judge Kathaleen McCormick settled both questions in a ruling today, denying Musk's request for delay but allowing him to amend the countersuit.

Musk had argued that a delay of at least four weeks wouldn't hurt Twitter because the merger agreement's ""termination date of October 24, 2022 is automatically stayed if litigation is commenced, and debt financing has an outside date of April 25, 2023."" Musk previously lost an attempt to delay the trial until February 2023, and McCormick referred to her previous ruling in today's order denying Musk's motion for a delay until mid-November:

I previously rejected Defendants' arguments in response to Twitter's motion to expedite, making clear that the longer the delay until trial, the greater the risk of irreparable harm to Twitter. Indeed, Twitter has represented that the anticipated risk of harm has materialized over the course of this litigation. Twitter ""has suffered increased employee attrition,"" which ""undermin[es] the company's ability to pursue its operations goals. The company has been forced for months to manage under the constrains [sic] of a repudiated merger agreement, including Defendants' continued refusal to provide any consents for matters under the operating covenants."" I am convinced that even four weeks' delay would risk further harm to Twitter too great to justify.

""In maintaining the case schedule, I am further comforted by the fact that Twitter has represented that it can handle reasonable requests for additional discovery while maintaining the October 17 trial date,"" McCormick also wrote."

"After months of treatments and tests, insurance company won’t cover woman’s lifesaving transplant",https://www.wsbtv.com/news/georgia/following-months-treatments-tests-insurance-company-wont-cover-womans-lifesaving-transplant/A37FLKB7KBHKBOPJ3C6JWLJPMM/?outputType=amp,nottheonion,"MONROE COUNTY, Ga — A young mother is in a fight for her life, and a liver transplant is the only thing that can save her.

After months of treatments and tests, she qualified for the transplant list at Emory University Hospital. But now her insurance provider refuses to allow the surgery.

Erika Gidituri, 32, has one of the most aggressive cancers there is. It took five months for her to go through all the pretransplant protocols at Emory.

Now her insurer is demanding she start that process all over again at an out-of-state hospital.

The life expectancy of the cancer without that transplant is only six to 12 months. This is time she does not have.

Channel 2 investigative reporter Justin Gray said watching Gidituri playing with her three young children, you wouldn’t know the Monroe County woman is even sick.

“My children, potentially leaving that at such a young age is scary. I’m fearful for them my husband, just leaving them behind,” Gidituri said.

After five months of chemo, radiation, MRIs and other tests just after Christmas, Gidituri met the protocols.

Her cancer hasn’t spread, and she could go on the liver transplant list at Emory University Hospital, where she’s been receiving all her treatment.

TRENDING STORIES:

“I was told that I was medically cleared for transplant, but not financially,” Gidituri said.

Her health insurance is a self-funded plan by Texas-based Zachry Group, her husband’s employer.

It’s a construction company hired as a contractor by a Georgia power plant in Juliette.

Zachry told Gidituri it won’t pay for the transplant at Emory.

Her sister, Alison McCoy, told Gray that she’s spent hours battling Zachry without success on the phone.

“It’s infuriating. Scary. Mad is an understatement. I don’t understand how this is even possible. It’s an impossible situation,” McCoy said.

Zachry told Gidituri she can only have a transplant at a hospital in Jacksonville, Florida — something they never mentioned over the past five months of treatments at Emory.

But that would mean Gidituri has to start many of the protocols to get on the transplant list all over again.

That will take months. Without that surgery, Gidituri does not have months.

“It’s not fair that they have the ultimate say in my medical treatment,” Gidituri said.

“If they told us in August, go to Mayo, you need to move to Florida, it would have been done. But that wasn’t the case,” McCoy said.

Gray has attempted repeatedly by email and phone to contact Zachry Group. They have not responded to any of his requests for comment.

Gidituri said she is heading to Florida for tests at the other hospital this week, but this is weeks and likely months of protocols she already went through — and there is no time to start over.

If the cancer spreads in the meantime, she’ll no longer be a candidate for a liver transplant.

"Sen. Ron Johnson says critical race theory, 'wokeness' responsible for school shootings",https://www.kenoshanews.com/sen-ron-johnson-says-critical-race-theory-wokeness-responsible-for-school-shootings/article_eb13ea76-ddf6-11ec-bb54-87b7e43a3fbc.html,nottheonion,"U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson said he opposes new gun laws and blamed “wokeness” and critical race theory for school shootings, days after a gunman in Texas killed 21 people, almost all of whom were elementary school students.

“This is a society-wide problem, a society-wide sickness that is not going to be solved by some gun law, additional gun laws here in Washington, D.C.,” the Oshkosh Republican told Fox Business host Neil Cavuto.

Asked whether stiffer background checks could curb future school shootings, Johnson said people will always fall through the cracks. He added he believed some people shouldn’t have guns but questioned how that determination might be made.

“The solution lies in stronger families, more supportive communities, I would argue renewed faith,” Johnson said. “We’ve lost that. We stopped teaching values in so many of our schools. Now we’re teaching 'wokeness.' We’re indoctrinating our children with things like CRT, telling, you know, some children they’re not equal to others and they’re the cause of other people’s problems.”

CRT refers to critical race theory, a decades-old academic framework used in graduate courses to understand how laws and institutions perpetuate racism. It is not taught in elementary schools, though conservatives have often conflated it with lessons focused on diversity, equity and inclusion. The concept has become a campaign talking point among conservatives trying to galvanize their base.

Cavuto pushed back, saying school shootings have been going on long before “wokeness” and critical race theory.

“I think CRT has been going on under the radar for quite some time as well,” Johnson said. “'Wokeness' has been, liberal indoctrination has been. This is a much larger issue than what a simple new gun law’s going to — it’s not going to solve it, it’s not going to solve it.”

Johnson spokesperson Alexa Henning did not respond to a request for comment.

But those running for Johnson's Senate seat later this year spoke out.

“Ron Johnson is bearing false witness when he refuses to name the cause of these mass tragedies, which is our nation’s lunatic access to weapons of mass destruction of the type used to slaughter these children in Uvalde,” Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Tom Nelson said in a statement, calling for an assault rifle ban.

“Doing nothing has resulted in one thing: more dead children, and the people of Wisconsin are tired of having a do-nothing Senator in Washington,” Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Alex Lasry said. “We need to ban assault weapons, expand background checks, and make our communities safer. The only way to change the deadly status quo in this country is to get Ron Johnson out of the Senate.”

Democratic U.S. Senate candidate and state Treasurer Sarah Godlewski called for comprehensive background checks, red flag laws and a ban on high-capacity magazines, saying most Americans support those measures. She slammed Republicans in Washington, D.C., “bought and paid for by the gun lobby, who filibuster any meaningful change to our lax gun laws — forcing the rest of us to accept mass shooting deaths as a normal feature of American life.”

Democratic U.S. Senate candidate and Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes said Johnson wants to distract from the $1.2 million he has taken from the gun lobby. Barnes questioned how Wisconsinites could trust “anything that comes out of the mouth of a self-serving politician” whose loyalty can be bought.

“Ron Johnson and his gun lobby-funded colleagues are the reason we haven’t been able to pass commonsense gun reform,” Barnes said. “If he won’t step up to protect our kids, I will.”

Johnson’s comments also came a day after Democrats blocked his effort to codify the Federal Clearinghouse on School Safety into law.

That measure calls for the clearinghouse to include information about threat prevention, preparedness, protection, mitigation, incident response and recovery.

“It’s a good idea,” Johnson said. “It could save lives. It is an action, when people are calling for action following this tragedy.”

Democratic U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer blocked action on the bill Wednesday, saying he would focus instead on a measure that would authorize federal agencies to monitor, analyze, investigate and prosecute domestic terrorists. Republicans blocked that bill Thursday."
Rotterdam bridge taken apart to let through Jeff Bezos pleasure yacht,https://nltimes.nl/2022/02/02/rotterdam-bridge-taken-apart-let-jeff-bezos-pleasure-yacht,nottheonion,"Rotterdam will partly dismantle its iconic Koningshaven Bridge, better known as ""De Hef"" among locals, so that a new pleasure yacht for Jeff Bezos can pass through it, Rijnmond reports. This to the annoyance of the Rotterdam Historical Society, which pointed out that the municipality promised never to dismantle the bridge again after its restoration finished in 2017.

Former Amazon CEO and the richest man in the world, Jeff Bezos commissioned Oceano in Alblasserdam to build him a gigantic pleasure yacht. The three-masted ship will be so large that it cannot pass under De Heff, despite the bridge's 40 meters clearance. The shipbuilder, therefore, approached the municipality of Rotterdam and asked that the bridge be temporarily dismantled. Oceano and Bezos will reimburse the costs.

The municipality appears willing to grant this request, much to the annoyance of Ton Wesselink of the Rotterdam Historical Society. ""Employment is important, but there are limits to what you can and may do to our heritage,"" he said to Rijnmond.

Marcel Walravens, the point of contact within the municipality on De Hef-related matters, told the broadcaster that the city agreed to the shipbuilder's request due to simple pragmatics. ""This mainly concerns the passage of a ship with high masts through De Hef. At the Koningenne Bridge, we can press a button, and it opens. That's not possible here because De Hef has a maximum height. The only alternative is to take out the middle part,"" he said. According to him, it is impractical to partially finish the ship, move it through De Hef, and then finish it somewhere else.

The municipality also considered the region's economic interest when granting the request, Walravens said. ""From an economic perspective and maintaining employment, the municipality considers this a very important project,"" he said. ""In addition, Rotterdam has also been declared the maritime capital of Europe. Shipbuilding and activity within that sector are therefore an important pillar of the municipality.""

He added that the city wouldn't change anything about the bridge. The middle part will be restored after the ship passes. According to Walravens, the municipality's promise not to mess with De Hef again is also a bit more nuanced. ""Never say never. I see it as using the resources you have as efficiently as possible.""

The municipality is still working out exactly when and how the bridge will be dismantled. ""As the plans look now, the preparation will take about a week. There are a lot of cables on De Hef, and as soon as you remove the first one, it no longer works. After that week, we remove the middle part, and with a bit of luck, we will have it back a day later. After that it will take another week to put everything back in place,"" Walravens explained to Rijnmond.

De Hef dates from 1878. It was heavily damaged during the bombing of 1940 and afterward was one of the first buildings in the city to be restored. In 1993, the bridge lost its function as a river crossing for train traffic between Breda and Rotterdam due to the arrival of the Willemspoort tunnel. The city quickly scrapped a plan to demolish the bridge due to fierce resistance from city residents. Since then, the bridge has been a national monument."
"Russia cannot 'tolerate' NATO's 'gradual invasion' of Ukraine, Putin spokesman says",https://thehill.com/policy/international/russia/589957-russia-cannot-tolerate-natos-gradual-invasion-of-ukraine-putin,nottheonion,"Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman said on Sunday that Russia began its military buildup along the Ukrainian border because it could no longer “tolerate” NATO’s eastward expansion and “gradual invasion” of Ukraine.

Appearing on CNN’s “Fareed Zakaria GPS,” Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the stage for the current border crisis was set decades ago, in the ’90s. Roughly 100,000 Russian soldiers have recently amassed near Ukraine, leading to concerns that Russia will invade its neighbor soon.

“When Germany was reunited and when the then-Soviet Union and the Soviet Union leader Mr. [Mikhail] Gorbachev said OK to that, there was a promise by American side,” Peskov said on Sunday.

“Unfortunately, not fixed in a juridical, in a legally binding guaranteeing document, but it — there was a guarantee that NATO would never … expand its military infrastructure or political infrastructure eastwards,” he continued.

“Unfortunately, the opposite thing started to happen since then, and NATO’s military infrastructure started to get closer and closer to the borders of the Russian Federation,” he added, saying that recent actions by the U.S. military led Russia to feel that its national security was being “endangered.”

Peskov, a career diplomat and longtime Putin spokesman, accused NATO of being a “weapon of confrontation” rather than a “dove of peace.” Russia has demanded a guarantee that Ukraine not become part of NATO, which it says would be a severe threat to its security.

“At first, they were just words, but with the time being, we have seen the gradual invasion of NATO into Ukrainian territory, with its infrastructure, with its instructors, with supplies of defensive and offensive weapons, teaching Ukrainian military, and so on and so forth. And that brought us to the red line. That brought us to the situation when we — when we couldn’t tolerate it anymore,” said Peskov.

White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said last week that the threat of a Russian invasion was “high,” and U.S. intelligence said Moscow was planning a false-flag operation as a pretext for launching an invasion into Kyiv.

Though he did not directly address that specific accusation, Peskov stated that there were no soldiers in the Donbas region of Ukraine, despite reports that Russian soldiers out of uniform have been seen there.

“I’m a spokesperson to Kremlin, and I officially can tell you that there are no Russian troops on Donbas and on Ukrainian soil,” he said.

Zakaria asked Peskov if there was any room for a potential compromise in the unlikely event that Ukraine becomes a NATO member sometime soon.

“Well, there is also space for compromise. Excluding some principal concerns, and here we’re talking about principal concerns. Russia has never had a deficit of political will for negotiations,” said Peskov. “But in general, in principle, we can now say that we are staying on different tracks, on totally different tracks, and this is not good, and this is disturbing.”"
Research finds turning off air conditioning during the day can save money,https://www.10news.com/news/national/research-finds-turning-off-air-conditioning-during-the-day-can-save-money?fbclid=IwAR2q6b0uQ5HOhjKqQS4FhfGl4kq6dd1SI2rnpnkmLiY4pLhr4OCsO7HFnuo,nottheonion,"Extreme heat is becoming more common, and Americans are trying to cool down without breaking the bank.

New research recommends turning off the air conditioning while you're at work.

""You could save over ten percent on an annual basis in a really hot climate like Phoenix,"" said Ash Pigott, a Ph.D. student at the University of Colorado who worked on the research.

Pigott and her team simulated the energy use of an average home in Arizona and Georgia.

They look at three different scenarios: Someone who left the air conditioning on all day, someone who turned it off for four hours, and someone who turned it off for a ""full work day"" (eight hours).

Homes that turned off the air for eight hours saw the greatest energy savings.

The difference could add up to a couple of bucks a month.

""There's been some concern over people who have pets that are home all day or people who aren't gone for exactly eight hours,"" Pigott said. ""I think that those are reasonable concerns. But I would encourage them that setting it back even a few degrees can still have savings.""

The research also looked at efficiency across different types of air conditioners.

Research also found that overall usage was much lower among air source heat pumps and mini-splits.

""People can't believe [the heat pumps] are much more efficient,"" Pigott said. ""But they really are because they're just trying to keep running at the most efficient level.""

Pigott said it might be worth considering a smart thermometer to maximize cost savings in the home.

""You can set the temperature to come down by the time you get home at five,"" Pigott said. ""So you're not seeing any of that heat. You're walking into a nice cool house.""

Larry the Cat outlasts fourth U.K. prime minister,https://www.npr.org/2022/10/21/1130251187/larry-the-cat-prime-minister,nottheonion,"Larry the Cat outlasts fourth U.K. prime minister

Britain's prime ministers may come and go, but Larry the Cat is here to stay.

The 15-year-old tabby dutifully serves as Chief Mouser of No. 10 Downing Street, the residence and home office of Britain's prime minister, and where countless political decisions affecting the country are made. Larry outlasted prime ministers David Cameron, Theresa May, Boris Johnson and, as of Thursday, the six-week tenure of Liz Truss.

""The King has asked me to become Prime Minister because this nonsense has gone on long enough,"" Larry the Cat wrote in a now viral tweet from an unofficial account hours before Truss announced her resignation.

And in a period of shaky political leadership, Larry's steady tenure led to an enormous loyal following among British citizens. His presence at 10 Downing Street often leads to brief appearances in historical moments — including taking a nap underneath a limo that extended Donald Trump's visit in 2019.

But Larry's record isn't completely spotless, either. A 2016 visit to the vet put his health into question while a 2011 mouse sighting put the integrity of his work into question.

But Larry seems to have redeemed himself in the eyes of the public: In the days leading up to Truss announcing her resignation, a video of the cat chasing a fox — much larger than any mouse — away from the prime minister headquarters amazed fans.

His appointment at 10 Downing Street began on Feb. 15, 2011, after TV cameras spotted a rat outside the entrance. The U.K. Cabinet, under Cameron, rescued the cat from Battersea Dogs & Cats Home and officially appointed him as Chief Mouser, according to the U.K. government website.

And as the British public awaits the identity of its fifth prime minister in just six years, Larry is vowing that he will remain in his position for as long as he can.

""Lots of people asking whether it's Liz Truss or Jeremy Hunt who's in charge,"" his unofficial account posted on Monday. ""It's neither. I am. I'll be here long after they're both gone."""
Woman quits job to breastfeed boyfriend full time,https://www.mystateline.com/news/weird/woman-quits-job-to-breastfeed-boyfriend-full-time/,nottheonion,"ATLANTA, Ga. (WTVO) — A woman in Atlanta says she has quit her job in order to pump enough breast milk to feed her bodybuilding boyfriend every two hours.

According to The Sun, Jennifer Mulford left her job as a bartender so she could produce enough milk for her boyfriend, Brad Leeson, full time.

Mulford said she was single when she found a website about Adult Breastfeeding Relationships (ABR).

“I have always enjoyed my breasts being touched during sex more than anything else so I knew I would enjoy it,” she told The Sun. “I used dating sites, put messages on ABR forums and even put an advert on Craigslist, but I drew a blank. I started to think I’d never get to try adult breastfeeding.”

Eventually, she started talking with Leeson, a former school boyfriend.

“I thought it was the perfect time to bring up adult breastfeeding – and see if he’d be interested,” Mulford said.

Mulford, 36, gave birth to her daughter twenty years ago and said she had to ‘dry’ breastfeed Leeson every two hours and use a breast pump to fool her body into lactating.

“I’ve taken a break from my job because I want to devote everything to making this work,” she said.

Mulford said she believes adult breastfeeding will create a “magical bond” between them, and Leeson, meanwhile, hopes nursing will give his body health benefits.

However, critics on social media have criticized the pair for “sexualizing” breastfeeding. “It’s idiots like these two that are making it difficult for breastfeeding mothers to do so publicly without shame or ridicule. They are only increasing the sexualization of breastfeeding. There are NO medical benefits for adults to consume breast milk. Breast milk is for babies,” one woman wrote on Facebook."
Kent brewery hailed as Brexit ‘export champion’ has one EU customer left,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/sep/04/it-was-a-brexit-export-champion-now-kent-brewery-has-one-eu-customer-left,nottheonion,"A Kent brewery chosen to help champion export opportunities for the government after Brexit has revealed that burdensome customs checks and paperwork have left it with just one remaining customer in the EU.

The Old Dairy Brewery in Kent – a Department for International Trade export champion for the south-east – appeared in a government video last year promoting the potential to boost Brexit export sales.

However its exports of bottled and keg Kent ale to countries including Italy, Germany and Sweden have slumped since the UK left the EU because of the onerous paperwork.

The brewery now has just one EU customer, a Berlin pub operator who travels to England by van to pick up the beer. The value of the Kent brewery’s annual beer exports have fallen from £600,000 to £2,000.

Virginia Hodge, export manager at the brewery, based at Tenterden, said: “Some transport companies won’t take alcohol now because of all the transit documents you need. I used to be able to make up a case of beer and send it by courier [to the EU] and now I have to send it through the full customs declaration. Our customers in Europe say they want to take British beer, but it’s just not cost effective. They’ve got to do a lot more paperwork.”

She said the brewery’s one remaining EU customer had faced multiple challenges. She said: “The first time he came over, we were up all night trying to get him through customs at Dover and out of the country.

“He was stuck because of the paperwork. He used to come over for just one night, but now it takes four days because of all the problems.”

Hodge said small businesses were not given sufficient support. She said: “There is nobody to ask and there is no system.” She said advisers on government helplines referred questions about export problems to the government website.

Goods exports from the UK to the EU reached £16.9bn in May, the highest level since figures started in 1997. It is, however, smaller traders who have particularly struggled with the additional paperwork required for exports after Brexit.

The Old Dairy Brewery now hopes to boost its EU business once again by consolidating orders with other small breweries. It is now overseeing an export collective that it hopes will help increase the trade in British beers.

Hodge said: “We hope the export collective will make us more attractive to overseas importers. We’re trying to get some beer at the moment out for a trade show in Munich, but the paperwork is massive.”

She added it was “ironic” that the brewery had been selected to promote potential opportunities after Brexit, but said she hoped the collective would help overcome the bureaucratic challenges now involved in selling to EU customers.

Andrew Griffith, the minister for exports, said: “We know businesses have had to get to grips with new rules post-Brexit. We are helping more businesses seize new opportunities, and our export strategy is giving them the tools they need.”"
Mariah Carey says we should finally hear her secret 1995 grunge album,https://www.npr.org/2022/09/20/1124079484/mariah-carey-secret-grunge-album,nottheonion,"Mariah Carey says we should finally hear her secret 1995 grunge album

As Mariah Carey was recording her smash hit 1995 pop album Daydream, she and her fellow musicians were also secretly putting together a grunge album.

Carey first mentioned the existence of the secret album in her 2020 memoir, The Meaning of Mariah Carey. A version of the record was quietly released at the time under the band name Chick, titled Someone's Ugly Daughter, with Carey singing backup vocals.

In a new interview with the podcast Rolling Stone Music Now, Carey has shared that recordings of the alt-rock album with her lead vocals have been found. And she hinted that the elusive project will finally be released.

""I think this unearthed version will become, yes, something we should hear,"" she told Rolling Stone. She suggested, without providing details, that she was even building on the record with an unnamed musician: ""I'm working on a version of something where there'll be another artist working on this with me as well.""

Carey described the project — recorded after long days in the studio while working on hits such as ""Always Be My Baby"" — as an outlet for herself during a period when she felt particularly constrained.

""I had no freedom during that time. That was my freedom, making that record,"" she told the podcast.

Carey told Rolling Stone she was inspired by bands such as Hole and Green Day at the time. She adopted an alter-ego, as she recalled in her book: ""I was playing with the style of the breezy-grunge, punk-light white female singers who were popular at the time. You know the ones who seemed to be so carefree with their feelings and their image.""

At the time, she recalls that there was some unease about her grunge lyrics. ""I honestly wanted to put the record out back then under, you know, the same pseudonym, just put it out and be like, you know whatever, let them discover that it's me,"" she told Rolling Stone. ""But that idea was kind of stomped and squashed.""

Carey said she even did the album art — a cockroach and some scrawled lipstick. She remembers driving around, shouting lyrics to songs she wrote that nobody knew.

Ultimately, she said that a friend of hers named Clarissa Dane recorded lead vocals and wrote a grunge song with Carey, and it was released with Carey on backup vocals. That version is no longer widely available.

But it seems like the version that Carey wants us to hear may be coming soon."
First-dose vaccinations quadruple in Quebec ahead of restrictions at liquor and cannabis stores,https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/first-dose-vaccinations-quadruple-in-quebec-ahead-of-restrictions-at-liquor-and-cannabis-stores-1.5731327,nottheonion,"The number of appointments for the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine has risen sharply this week in Quebec, according to Health Minister Christian Dubé.

In a brief message posted to social media Friday morning, Dubé notes that in the last few days, appointments for first doses have increased from 1,500 per day to more than 6,000.

The minister took a moment to thank those who finally decided to get vaccinated, reiterating that it is never too late to receive a first dose of vaccine.

Thursday, Dubé announced that vaccine passports would be required to enter Société des alcools du Québec (SAQ) and Société québécoise du cannabis (SQDC) locations starting Jan. 18.

He explains the decision was made to curb an increase in cases of the highly contagious Omicron variant.

He says he hopes this measure will be an additional incentive for some people to get their first dose of vaccine against COVID-19, as more than 50 per cent of people currently hospitalized are non-vaccinated people, though they represent about 10 per cent of the population.

Dubé adds in the coming weeks, other non-essential services, including personal care, could be added to the list of places requiring a vaccine passport.

Utah Republican Senator Mike Lee Introduces Bill to Outlaw All Porn Nationwide,https://www.xbiz.com/news/270761/utah-republican-senator-mike-lee-introduces-bill-to-outlaw-all-porn-nationwide,nottheonion,"WASHINGTON and SALT LAKE CITY — Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) this week introduced the Interstate Obscenity Definition Act (IODA), a bill that nominally aims to “establish a national definition of obscenity” but which would, in effect, outlaw all online sexual content nationwide.

The United States does not currently have a national definition of obscenity. Jurisprudence has established the Miller Test, which has been a legal standard in federal courts for a half-century. According to a statement from Lee’s office, however, the Utah senator believes that it is time to codify those standards, set in 1973, under which the production and distribution of sexual content have been legal in the United States.

According to Lee, “The Supreme Court has struggled to define obscenity, and its current definition under the ‘Miller Test’ runs into serious challenges when applied to the internet.”

Echoing the language of fellow Utahn and Mormon Republican activist Dawn Hawkins, CEO of powerful anti-porn lobby NCOSE, Lee's bill “would define ‘obscenity’ within the Communications Act of 1934. Additionally, it would also strengthen the existing prohibition on obscenity by removing the ‘intent’ requirement,” which only prohibits the transmission of obscenity to abuse, threaten or harass someone.

Lee is essentially arguing that a 1973 precedent should be updated for the internet age by revising a law from 1934, adopted long before even the mainstream adoption of television.

Lee is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which, as XBIZ reported, sees sexual content as a ploy by Satan to destroy Mormon households by tempting Mormon men.

Lee's Proposed Criminalization of Porn

Lee’s office posted a one-page summary of the IODA, stating that “Obscenity is not protected speech under the First Amendment and is prohibited from interstate or foreign transmission under U.S. law,” calling obscenity “difficult to define (let alone prosecute) under the current Supreme Court test for obscenity: the ‘Miller Test’” and promising that the IODA will “establish a national definition of obscenity that would apply to obscene content that is transmitted via interstate or foreign communications.”

Lee's proposed redefinition of “obscenity” would eliminate Miller Test references to “contemporary community standards” and “applicable state law,” instead defining obscene content as any material that “(i) taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest in nudity, sex, or excretion, (ii) depicts, describes or represents actual or simulated sexual acts with the objective intent to arouse, titillate, or gratify the sexual desires of a person, and, (iii) taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.”

Industry attorney Corey Silverstein, of MyAdultAttorney.com and Adult.law., told XBIZ that Lee “is correct that obscenity is ‘difficult to define,’” and even believes that exchanging “contemporary community standards” for a national standard “is not necessarily a bad idea.” He notes, however, that “where Senator Lee goes wrong is that his bill does not specifically call for a nationwide standard. Senator Lee appears to be attempting to change Miller vs. California and in essence overrule it — which in my opinion is unconstitutional.”

If the IODA succeeds, and sexual content loses the free-speech protections that have stood for the last 50 years, that would open the door for the government to prosecute every creator or distributor of adult content.

Proposal to teach slavery as 'involuntary relocation' sent to Texas education board,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/proposal-teach-slavery-involuntary-relocation-sent-texas-education-boa-rcna36273,nottheonion,"AUSTIN, Texas — Public schools in Texas would describe slavery to second graders as ""involuntary relocation"" under new social studies standards proposed to the state’s education board.

A group of nine educators submitted the idea to the State Board of Education as part of Texas’ efforts to develop new social studies curriculum, according to the Texas Tribune. The once-a-decade process updates what children learn in the state’s nearly 8,900 public schools.

“The board -- with unanimous consent -- directed the work group to revisit that specific language,” Keven Ellis, chair of the Texas State Board of Education, said in a statement, according to the Tribune.

Board member Aicha Davis, a Democrat who represents Dallas and Fort Worth, raised concerns during a June 15 meeting that the term wasn’t a fair representation of the slave trade. The board sent the draft back for revision, urging the educator group to “carefully examine the language used to describe events.”

“I can’t say what their intention was, but that’s not going to be acceptable,” Davis told the Tribune on Thursday.

Part of the proposed draft standards obtained by the Tribune say students should “compare journeys to America, including voluntary Irish immigration and involuntary relocation of African people during colonial times.”

The board is considering curriculum changes one year after Texas passed a law to eliminate topics from schools that make students “feel discomfort.”

The state's public education system has become heavily politicized in recent years, with lawmakers passing legislation to dictate how race and slavery should be taught in schools and conservative groups pouring large amounts of money into school board races.

Texas drew attention for a similar situation in 2015, when a student noticed wording in a textbook that referred to slaves who were brought to America as ""workers."" The book’s publisher apologized and promised to increase the number of textbook reviewers it uses."
Alabama prisons say reporter’s skirt too short to witness execution,https://www.al.com/news/birmingham/2022/07/alabama-prisons-say-reporters-skirt-too-short-to-witness-execution.html,nottheonion,"Alabama prison officials examined female reporters’ clothing and tried to block a female reporter with AL.com from witnessing Thursday night’s execution of a death-row inmate, saying her skirt and shoes violated a prison dress code.

Ivana Hrynkiw, a reporter and managing producer with AL.com, said she was told by Alabama Department of Corrections Public Information Officer Kelly Betts after she arrived at the media center at William C. Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore that her skirt was too short.

“I have worn this skirt to prior executions without incident, to work, professional events and more and I believe it is more than appropriate. At 5′10″ with my heels on, I am a tall and long-legged person,” she said on Twitter. Hrynkiw, an award-winning journalist, has attended and witnessed seven executions.

Hrynkiw said she tried to lower her skirt at the hip in an attempt to comply with Betts, but that didn’t satisfy the prison official. In order to witness the execution for reporting purposes, she had to borrow a pair of Columbia PFG fisherman’s waders from a local television photographer. The fishing gear was deemed appropriate attire.

“I put on the man’s pants and attached the suspenders underneath my shirt to stay up,” she said.

Following the change of clothes, Hrynkiw was told her open-toed heels also violated policy. She was told to put on closed-toe shoes, and put on tennis shoes she had in her car.

The prison spokesperson said the skirt violated the prison’s dress length policy, as well as her open-toed shoes, Hrynkiw said.

“Despite wearing a pair of waders from a man I have never met and casual tennis shoes, I continued to do my job,” Hrynkiw said. “This was an uncomfortable situation, and I felt embarrassed to have my body and my clothes questioned in front of a room of people I mostly had never met.”

The female reporter for the Associated Press was also subjected to stand in front of the media center room and have her outfit scrutinized, but Betts and a corrections officer determined she passed the dress code.

“This was unacceptable, unequal treatment,” said Kelly Ann Scott, editor in chief and vice president of content for Alabama Media Group. “I’m proud to work with Ivana, who despite this treatment, continued to report the story with professionalism to our audiences in Alabama.

“This was sexist and an egregious breach of professional conduct. And it should not happen to any other reporter again.”

AL.com sent a formal complaint to ADOC, Gov. Kay Ivey and Attorney General Steve Marshall on Friday.

The Associated Press, who also had a female reporter subjected to that same clothing inspection, also sent a letter to Ivey late Friday afternoon asking her office to investigate and “ensure such behavior is not tolerated and does not occur again.

“Singling out female reporters for arbitrary clothing inspections is humiliating, discriminatory and simply unacceptable behavior toward professional journalists trying to cover one of the most serious events they are called upon to witness,” Julie Pace, Executive Editor The Associated Press, stated in the letter.

After the incident, Hrynkiw and others asked for the dress code and Betts provided an online link to a prison visitation dress code. The dress code is mainly directed at women and states that “all dresses, skirts, and pants shall extend below the knee (females only). Splits/Slits must be knee length or lower (females only).” As for shoes, the only reference is made in the items prohibited include “slippers, shower shoes, and beach shoes.”

Hrynkiw and other reporters who have been covering executions over the past decade have not had any prison official cite any dress codes for reporters. The prison spokeswoman admitted that reporters may not have known about the policy, and it had not been enforced before. She said the new warden of Holman, Terry Raybon, wished to enforce the policy.

The spokeswoman again provided a copy of a prison visitation policy, which includes a dress code for visitors at the request of AL.com. There is no listed dress code specifically for members of the media or for covering executions.

Related: Execution delayed for hours because of IV line problems, Alabama prisons say

Betts released a statement Friday afternoon, after calling Hrynkiw and personally apologizing for the sudden enforcement of the dress code, along with embarrassment that was caused. “The Alabama Department of Corrections (ADOC) has an administrative regulation regarding visitation to any ADOC facility. Within this regulation there is a dress code for all visitors including reporters covering executions. All administrative regulations are posted on the ADOC website.

“The wardens of each ADOC facility enforce this dress code based on each event and current safety conditions. It will be the policy of ADOC in the future to remind all members of the media about this dress code before any media event taking place at an ADOC facility.

“We apologize for any confusion or inconvenience this regulation may have caused. We hope by including it in future media advisories, we can avoid this kind of situation.”"
Man who paid $2.9m for NFT of Jack Dorsey’s first tweet set to lose almost $2.9m,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/14/twitter-nft-jack-dorsey-sina-estavi?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Other,nottheonion,"Crypto entrepreneur Sina Estavi made headlines in March 2021 when he paid $2.9m for an NFT of Twitter boss Jack Dorsey’s first tweet. But his efforts to resell it have run aground, with a top bid of just $6,800 as of Thursday.

The initial purchase was at the time among the most expensive sales of a non-fungible token, or NFT, and came amid a flurry of interest in the niche crypto assets.

Estavi put the tweet up for resale on the popular NFT marketplace OpenSea last week, initially asking for $48m.

That price tag was removed after offers in the first week were in the low hundreds of dollars. As of Thursday, the highest bid was 2.2 of the cryptocurrency ether – equivalent to about $6,800.

“My offer to sell was high and not everyone could afford it,” Estavi told Reuters via Twitter direct message, adding that he was no longer sure if he would sell the NFT.

“It’s important to me who wants to buy it, I will not sell this NFT to anyone because I do not think everyone deserves this NFT,” Estavi said.

NFTs are a form of crypto asset which can record the ownership of a digital file such as an image, video or text.

There is no guarantee of an NFT’s value and the market is rife with scams, fraud, counterfeits and market manipulation.

But Estavi was confident in the value of his purchase.

“This NFT is not just a tweet, this is the Mona Lisa of the digital world,” he said.

Estavi, who lives in Malaysia, said he had been arrested last May during a trip to Iran. He was freed in February. Iranian state media reported in May 2021 that he was accused of “disrupting the country’s economic system”.

Estavi said he had been arrested because of the growth of his crypto exchange, Bridge Oracle.

Reuters was unable to independently verify these details.

“I need the support of the cryptocurrency community,” Estavi said.

While announcing the NFT sale in a tweet on 6 April, Estavi pledged to give 50% of the proceeds – which he expected to be at least $25m – to charity.

He said the rest would go to support Bridge Oracle."
Man who complained about living next door to paedophile is jailed for being a paedeophile.,https://www.sthelensstar.co.uk/news/20070560.birchwood-paedophile-jailed-sexually-abusing-child/,nottheonion,"Darren Higham previously claimed he was ‘furious’ about living next door to the sex offender, but he is now behind bars for sexually abusing a child over a period of four years.

He subjected a child to horrific sexual abuse from the age of seven until she was around 11.

The abuse ranged from kissing and touching the child to forcing her to perform sex acts on him on more than one occasion.

Higham, of Chaffinch Close, Birchwood, appeared before Liverpool Crown Court on Tuesday after pleading guilty to four counts of sexual assault of a child under 13 and inciting a girl under 13 to engage in sexual activity.

The 53-year-old’s sick offending came to light when he was spotted with the victim, said prosecutor David Watson.

Mr Watson said how the person who saw them felt like something ‘wasn’t right’ so contacted social services.

The victim later told her mum that she had been sexually abused by Higham for ‘ages’.

The child told the police how Higham, a self-employed musician, used to kiss her and put his penis on her and recalled on one occasion how he had touched her.

She also told them how he asked her not to tell anyone about the abuse as it would mean he would be sent to prison.

The court heard how the victim said this made her feel scared and sometimes she would pretend to be tired and fall asleep so he would stop.

When these allegations were put towards Higham, he self-harmed and was hospitalised but was later interviewed by police and admitted to the abuse.

Higham is a self-employed musician who goes by the name of 'Diz'

He told officers that ‘something triggered’ inside of him but he told them he had no sexual interest in children.

Mr Watson read out a statement from the victim’s mother who claimed the sexual abuse committed by Higham has had a ‘massive’ impact.

The statement said that the victim sometimes feels unloved and is undergoing counseling and trauma therapy as a result.

Defending, Gary Lawrenson said that prior to these offences, Higham was a man of good character.

He told the court how Higham has shown genuine remorse and is willing to engage in any work with the probation services.

Mr Lawrenson said: “He does not seek to minimise his actions in any way, shape or form.”

And in a letter to the court, Higham said: “There are no words to say how much devastation and remorse I feel. I stand before you with acceptance of any punishment that you deem fit.”

Higham was handed a four-year prison sentence, issued with a Sexual Harm Prevention Order for 10 years and is subject to a restraining order for 10 years.

Detective constable Chris Orme said: “This young person showed great courage coming forward to report what had been happening.

“This ultimately meant that Darren Higham could be put in front of the court, where he pleaded guilty to these awful crimes.

“I hope the sentence brings some closure for the victim.

“Cheshire Police is committed to protecting children and bringing to justice those who seek to harm them.”"

"Rivers Cuomo launches Weezify, a streaming platform like Spotify but just for his Weezer demos",https://www.musicradar.com/news/weezer-rivers-cuomo-weezify,nottheonion,"Alt-rock pioneer, hair metal aficionado, and tech titan? Weezer frontman and guitarist Rivers Cuomo has put his web programming lessons to good use by launching a streaming service that makes thousands of the Los Angeles rock band’s demos available to the public.

Available via Apple (opens in new tab) and Google Play (opens in new tab), Weezify is a testament to Cuomo’s productivity, and not just in computer science – it hosts almost 3,500 demos in total, recorded between 1975 and 2017, many of which pre-dated Weezer.

According to the description on the Apple App store, the project took Cuomo the whole of 2021 to make. Users can follow playlists, create their own or buy bundles of demos.

A Harvard graduate, Cuomo checked back in with his alma mater to take an online CS50 course, learning programs such as Scratch and Python, and making his demo recordings available via his website, Mister Rivers’ Neighborhood.

Speaking to TechCrunch+ (opens in new tab) in 2020, Cuomo revealed that he documented all of his songs on Microsoft Excel and Access, but as the database grew, with more meta data to manage, it led him to an interest in programming.

“By the end of the course, I was writing programs that were really helping me manage my day-to-day life as a traveling musician and then also managing my spreadsheets and managing my work as a creative artist,” he said.

As for Weezer, 2022 is forecasted to be a big year, with their four-album Seasons [stylized SZNS] project to be released Vivaldi-style, with each album corresponding to spring, summer, autumn and winter, and each following a different them and style.

Informal market research indicates that the self-heating dishes are quite popular among cats, and social media has the posts to prove it, Gizmodo reported.

“Starlink works great until the cats find out that the dish gives off a little heat on cold days,” Starlink user Aaron Taylor tweeted recently.

The photo that accompanied Taylor’s Dec. 31 post showed five felines huddled on, and in no obvious hurry to move from, a ground-level Starlink dish.

According to Tesmanian, the dish’s Snow Melt Mode is the most likely culprit. The feature, launched in 2020, allows self-heating capabilities to prevent snow build-up from interfering with the satellite’s signal, the Tesla- and SpaceX-focused news outlet reported.

Taylor was quick to note via Twitter that the cats in question have ample warm and indoor alternatives to suit their lounging needs, all of which they ignore in favor of the $499 terminal.

This is what surprises me the most. They have a heated cat house, with water and food, but -25°C and they decide to sit on the Starlink dish. When the sun goes down, they head back to their house. — Aaron Taylor (@Tippen22) January 1, 2022

“As any cat owner can testify, that tracks,” Gizmodo wrote.

According to the technology news outlet, SpaceX has deployed roughly 1,800 low-orbit satellites to date as part of its goal to deliver high-speed internet to rural areas via Starlink, and long-range plans call for the deployment of 42,000 by mid-2027.

India: Elderly couple sue son over lack of grandchildren,https://www.dw.com/en/india-elderly-couple-sue-son-over-lack-of-grandchildren/a-61768426,nottheonion,"An Indian couple has sued their son and daughter-in-law, demanding a grandchild. They say they invested in their son's education and wedding, and are therefore owed at least monetary compensation.

An Indian couple has sued their son, demanding that he and his wife produce a child within a year, or pay them a compensation of 50 million rupees (€620,000, $646,000), local media reported on Thursday.

Sanjeev and Sadhana Prasad filed a petition at a court in the city of Haridwar, in the northern state of Uttarakhand.

""My son has been married for six years but they are still not planning a baby. At least if we have a grandchild to spend time with, our pain will become bearable,"" the couple said in a petition.

The compensation would include the cost of a wedding reception in a five-star hotel, a luxury car worth $80,000 as well as the cost of paying for the couple's honeymoon in Thailand.

Plaintiffs willing to take care of the child

The younger couple had since moved to another city, and cut off communication with the son's parents.

""My son and daughter-in-law are living in two separate cities because of their jobs, causing us immense pain. We treated our daughter-in-law like our own daughter. Despite that, she seldom stays with us, adding to our sufferings,"" the couple told The Times of India newspaper.

They added that they were willing to take care of the child's upbringing if the daughter-in-law did not have time due to her professional commitments.

Parents call in debts

The petition also mentioned that the couple had paid for their son's training as a pilot, and had taken a loan to build a home.

""We're troubled financially and personally. We have demanded [25 million rupees] each from both my son and daughter-in-law in our petition,"" they told Indian news agency ANI.

The elderly couple's lawyer AK Srivastava told ANI that the case ""portrays the truth of society.""

""We invest in our children, make them capable of working in good firms. Children owe their parents basic financial care,"" he said.

The case will be heard by the court on May 17.

Times changing in India

In a traditional Indian family structure, it is common for married sons to stay with their parents, who often contribute to the upbringing of children.

Women who marry into such households are often expected to look after the household and take care of child-rearing duties.

Arizona bill would allow legislature to overturn election results,https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/591597-arizona-bill-would-allow-legislature-to-overturn-election-results,nottheonion,"An arch conservative member of Arizona’s state House of Representatives has proposed a mammoth overhaul of the state’s voting procedures that would allow legislators to overturn the results of a primary or general election after months of unfounded allegations and partisan audits.

The bill, introduced by state Rep. John Fillmore (R), would substantially change the way Arizonans vote by eliminating most early and absentee voting and requiring people to vote in their home precincts, rather than at vote centers set up around the state.

Most dramatically, Fillmore’s bill would require the legislature to hold a special session after an election to review election processes and results, and to “accept or reject the election results.”

The proposal comes after President Biden became the first Democrat since former President Clinton to win Arizona’s electoral votes. He defeated former President Trump there by just under 11,000 votes, or about three-tenths of a percentage point.

Ever since, Arizona Republicans have been riven between election denialists who have pushed to investigate or overturn those results and more mainstream legislators — and Gov. Doug Ducey (R) — who have tried to move on. An audit, conducted by an inexperienced firm called Cyber Ninjas, failed to uncover evidence of fraud or miscounting.

But Fillmore said at a committee hearing Wednesday he still does not believe the reports he has seen, though he maintained his skepticism has little to do with the ultimate winner.

“I don’t care what the press says. I don’t trust ABC, CBS, NBC or Fox or anybody out there. Everybody’s lying to me and I feel like I have a couple hundred ex-wives hanging around me,” Fillmore said. “This is not a President Biden thing. This is not a the other red-headed guy thing.”

“We should have voting in my opinion in person, one day, on paper, with no electronic means and hand counting that day. We need to get back to 1958-style voting,” he added.

Arizona Republicans, who shepherded through major overhauls of voting rights last year, are continuing their efforts to change election procedures in this year’s session. Legislators have introduced dozens of measures to change procedures around absentee ballots, which the vast majority of Arizona voters use to cast their votes, as well as rules about where people can vote and how election administrators go about cleaning up the voter rolls.

Fillmore’s legislation is unlikely to gain much traction, but it is a sign that some Republicans have embraced the idea that legislators should have veto power over the will of the voters if they do not like the results.

Arizona is one of seven states where Trump supporters created a series of fake documents purported to be from a slate of electors who voted for Trump in the 2020 elections. A senior Justice Department official said this week that those documents are being investigated. Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs (D) last month referred the matter to Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich (R), though Brnovich too has questioned the integrity of the 2020 elections."
Predominantly Black Town Ordered To Surrender Charter After Ford Invests In Area,https://themountain.news/news/predominantly-black-town-ordered-to-surrender-charter-after-ford-invests-in-area,nottheonion,"A quiet town with a little over 1,000 residents, Mason, Tennessee has become one of the closest towns to Ford’s Blue Oval City, a planned automotive assembly complex that could create 6,000 jobs in the local area. The $5.6 billion mega campus in Stanton, Tennessee would be only a 15-minute commute for the residents of Mason, a town that has had its share of financial hardship. The massive plant was announced in September of 2021. Less than a year later the predominantly African American got a letter in the mail from Nashville: it was time for Mason to give up its town charter. Without a charter, the town of Mason would be legally erased from the map.

In a letter sent to Mason residents, Tennessee Comptroller Mumpower claimed: “The construction of the new Ford plant in West Tennessee could offer hope to your community, but I worry that if you remain an incorporated town these opportunities will be missed. New jobs, infrastructure improvements, and economic investments are made in places with a track record of good government. Unfortunately, government is not working in Mason [sic]... People and companies will not invest their money in a poorly run town.” Mumpower goes on to allege in another letter that “Mason’s town government has been poorly run for at least 20 years. There has been a pattern of fiscal irresponsibility and even instances of fraud. Mason hasn’t submitted its audit on time since 2001, and the Comptroller’s Office hasn’t approved the town’s budget for four years in a row.” Between 2004 and 2016, Mason’s finances were in such disarray they were deemed “unauditable.”

However, there are two sides to this story. While Mason is majority African American, for more than a century Mason was run by White officials. That changed in 2016 when fraud and mismanagement allegations led to the resignations of nearly all City Hall officials, all of whom were White. Mason’s current mayor, vice-mayor, and five of its six Aldermen are Black. While Mumpower claims there has been a pattern of fiscal irresponsibility going back almost twenty years, the Comptroller’s Office continued to approve the town’s budget. Then, soon after the new majority African American government came to lead Mason was when the Comptroller’s Office decided to stop approving the town’s budget. “This is our home. We were born and raised here. The majority of the town is homegrown people that live here,” Vice Mayor Virginia Rivers said. “[Mumpower] is trying to conquer and divide us. It’s akin to a hostile take-over and it’s not hard to figure out why here, why now.” “When I saw that letter I was really shocked and unhappy with that letter because a lot of it is not true and he’s trying to split our city,” said Rivers. “We have made big improvements and the things that are being told are not true. We do still have debt, but we are able to pay our bills. We are not in default.” It is clear that the impetus for the order to surrender Mason’s charter was investments that could revitalize the area, not Mason’s history of financial hardship. It was financial hope rather than financial despair that drew eyes from Nashville.

What would happen if Mason surrenders its charter? A municipal charter is the basic document that defines the organization, powers, functions, and essential procedures of the city government. The charter is, therefore, the most important legal document of any city. When the charter is repealed, Mason would cease to exist. Mumpower said the state gave the town of Mason two options when it comes to rescinding their charter: The town could be governed by the county or be taken over by the state. If the state takes over Mason’s finances the state of Tennessee would have the authority to approve any expenditure of $100 or more. If Mason decides to be governed by the county the citizens would remain citizens of the county but would not be subject to Mason’s municipal taxes or regulations. Mason would be subject to annexation by other cities. Areas near Mason may also become subject to the city’s extra-territorial jurisdiction for land use regulation. Being governed by Tipton County is especially concerting to some because Mason is almost 70% African American, many of whom are descended from slaves, while Tipton County, where Mason resides, is majority white and overwhelmingly Republican. Mason’s residents could lose their autonomy in local affairs by being subsumed by a larger town whose larger numbers would dilute the will of Mason’s people. Mason could be a 15-minute drive from high-paying sustainable jobs that could greatly benefit the local economy. Yet Nashville has used this opportunity to pounce on Mason to subordinate it to Tipton County, yanking away Mason’s right to govern themselves just as they come out of a twenty-year financial malaise.

“West Tennessee is primed to deliver the workforce and quality of life needed to create the next great American success story with Ford Motor Company and SK Innovation,” said Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee. “This is a watershed moment for Tennesseans as we lead the future of the automotive industry and advanced manufacturing.” Mason will not be there to see this next great American success story. As of yesterday, March 17th, the state of Tennessee is officially taking over the town of Mason. This decision comes after Mason’s Board of Mayor and Aldermen voted not to surrender the town’s charter."
Cost of living: Shell boss calls on government to tax oil and gas companies to protect poorest,https://news.sky.com/story/cost-of-living-shell-boss-calls-on-government-to-tax-oil-and-gas-companies-to-protect-poorest-12712013?dcmp=snt-sf-twitter,nottheonion,"The chief executive of Shell has called on the government to tax oil and gas companies in order to protect the poorest people in society from soaring energy costs.

Speaking at the Energy Intelligence Forum in London, Ben van Beurden said: ""One way or another there needs to be government intervention that somehow results in protecting the poorest.

""That probably may then mean that governments need to tax people in this room to pay for it.""

His comment was in reference to companies rather than individuals, a Shell spokesperson later said.

UK economy live updates

High prices and market volatility is damaging to society, Mr van Beurden said.

""You cannot have a market that behaves in such a way... that is going to damage a significant part of society,"" he told those in attendance.

While the European Union approved emergency levies on energy firms' unusually high profits, the UK has chosen to borrow to fund consumer subsidies.

A windfall tax on oil and gas producers was announced in May but funding for the energy price guarantee subsidies announced last month is to be debt-funded.

However, the Shell boss said it's ""inevitable"" that taxes will be levied on energy firms with record profits.

""I think we just have to accept as a society - it can be done smartly and not so smartly. There is a discussion to be had about it but I think it's inevitable,"" Mr van Beurden said.

""But there shouldn't be intervention to cap gas prices.

""Can we make a meaningful intervention in gas markets here in Europe? That is a much more challenging prospect,"" he said.

""The solution should not be government intervention but protection of those who need protection.""

After more than eight years as chief executive of Shell, Mr van Beurden is to step down at the start of next year.

His statement is part of the fossil fuel company attempting to boost its reputation, according to Susannah Streeter, senior investment and market analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.

She added: ""These latest comments are a clear marker that Shell wants to ramp up its ESG strategy, not just in terms of its environmental credentials but it's social reputation as well.

""Shell's boss has flung open a door on a windfall tax which the UK government had been trying to close. This will reignite the debate over how profits of energy giants should be taxed."""
Police Officer Fired For Getting “Pure Evil” Tattoo On His Hands,https://sunny1063.com/listicle/police-officer-fired-for-getting-pure-evil-tattoo-on-his-hands/,nottheonion,"Eric Weyda, a former Cincinnati Police Officer, was fired back in April for what was considered to be an inappropriate tattoo. He had “pure” across the knuckles of his right hand, and “evil” on his left. The Police Department policy prohibits tattoos on the face, neck, head and hands. Having “Pure Evil” spelled out across your fists is probably not a good idea anyway. Weyda got the ink back in December and was reassigned to work the impound lot “to limit his public exposure.” He was then fired 4 months later.

According to Cincinnati news station WLWT, “Cincinnati police leadership wrote, “Officer Weyda’s tattoos are a violation that is ongoing and permanent. Additionally, Officer Weyda’s tattoos do not promote the professional and neutral image of the Cincinnati Police Department and are injurious to the public trust.” It continues “Weyda showed remorsefulness for obtaining the tattoo and acknowledged a lack of discretion since he obtained the tattoo in December 2021. Furthermore, Officer Weyda stated, like all of his tattoos, his hand tattoo has a personal message to him, and the words ‘pure evil’ should not be observed as one message. Officer Weyda explained the words “pure” and “evil” are separate from each other and the words themselves have separate meanings.”

When confronted with his tats in a hearing, Weyda chose not to get the tattoos removed because it would cost too much."
Teen’s suit says coaches made him eat pizza despite religion,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/teens-suit-says-coaches-made-eat-pizza-religion-rcna10592,nottheonion,"CANTON, Ohio—An Ohio high school football player who says coaches forced him to eat a pizza covered with pepperoni grease in violation of his religious beliefs is suing his former district and the ousted coaches.

The former Canton McKinley High School athlete and his parents filed a federal civil rights suit this week seeking millions of dollars in damages and alleging violations of his religious freedom and constitutional rights.

The athlete says in the lawsuit that coaches were notified he doesn’t eat pork or pork residue as a member of the Hebrew Israelite religious faith, but that they ordered him to eat the pizza as punishment for missing an offseason workout — and indicated his spot on the team was at risk if he didn’t.

The coaches say the player chose to remove pepperoni and eat the pizza rather than an alternative food. They weren’t aware it violated his religious beliefs, according to a defamation case they filed previously against the teen’s father, his attorney and school officials.

An attorney representing most of the coaches, Peter Pattakos, told The Repository newspaper of Canton that they have statements from over a dozen eyewitnesses that indicate the family’s allegations are false.

Canton City School District Superintendent Jeff Talbert said in a written statement that the claims in the family’s lawsuit are meritless and the school board will address them through the legal process, the newspaper reported.

The district suspended several coaches after the allegations arose. The board subsequently voted not to renew coaching contracts for four coaches and deemed three other assistant coaches as ineligible for future coaching positions.

The now-18-year-old student has transferred to a different district after facing “threats and ridicule” from teammates and the public because of the situation, according to his lawsuit."
"North Carolina Looks to Remove Public EV Chargers, Probably to the Trash",https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a40543385/north-carolina-wants-remove-free-public-ev-chargers/,nottheonion,"Politicians have to run on some kind of platform, and Ben Moss—my incoming state House representative here in North Carolina's District 52—decided that his animating principle is Being Mad at Electricity. To prove his animosity toward this invisible menace, he's sponsoring House Bill 1049, which would allocate $50,000 to destroy free public car chargers. It contains some other enlightened ideas, but that's the main theme: We've simply got to do something about these free public chargers, even if it costs us $50,000! Those things cost tens of cents per hour, when they're being used.

Of course, there's a caveat here. Moss isn't saying that free public Level 2 chargers—of which there are three in my town, with plans in the works to convert to paid kiosks—definitely need to get crushed by a monster truck. That rule only comes into play if a town refuses to build free gas and diesel pumps next to the EV chargers. So anyway, warm up El Toro Loco, we're smashin' some car zappers!

These public DC fast-chargers are not free. But imagine if they were! That would be outrageous. Car and Driver

But what about private businesses? you ask. Don't worry, Moss hasn't forgotten that a business might put a charger on its property as an inducement for EV owners to patronize the establishment. And small business is the heart of the local economy. That's why he's staying out of the way when it comes to private property. Just kidding! Ben Moss cares about the consumers being harmed by these hypothetical free chargers—namely, any customer who arrived via internal-combustion vehicle, or on foot, or in a sedan chair. Why is someone else gaining some advantage based on a decision they made? That's not how life works.

Thus, House Bill 1049 decrees that all customer receipts will have to show what share of the bill went toward the charger out in the lot. That way, anyone who showed up for dinner in an F-150 (not the electric one) can get mad that their jalapeño poppers helped pay for a business expense not directly related to them. It's the same way you demand to know how much Applebee's spends to keep the lights on in its parking lot overnight, when you're not there. Sure, this will be an accounting nightmare, but it'll all be worth it if we can prevent even one person from adding 16 miles of charge to a Nissan Leaf while eating a bloomin' onion—not that restaurants around here have free chargers, but you can't be too careful. Now, there is a charger at the neighborhood Ford dealership, which is marking up Broncos by $20,000. Coincidence? I think not.

This is probably to help pay the exorbitant costs of their on-site Level 2 car charger. Car and Driver

Critics of this bill might point out that increasing the number of electric cars could actually benefit owners of internal-combustion vehicles, thanks to reduced demand for petroleum products—kind of like how, during the Colonial Pipeline gas shortage, there were no Ford Mustang Mach-Es in line at the local pumps. Or, to put it another way, if the price of paste skyrockets because your local politicians eat so much paste, those prices might come down if you could get them to eat some crayons. But good luck with that! Paste is delicious.

Electron heads, as I call them, also like to point out that electricity is generated domestically, so your transportation dollars are staying in the U.S. rather than going to, say, Saudi Arabia. And if you really want to keep your money in your community, you can hire a local company to install solar panels and make your own electricity. District 52 includes numerous electricians, and Duke Energy utility workers, and solar installers. But no oil rig workers—yet!

If it doesn’t cost this much to charge an electric car, that’s not fair. Car and Driver

Which brings me to another point that's not at all related but I'll make it anyway: What we need in this area is more jobs, not more free public car chargers. And yes, electric-car company VinFast is building a 2000-acre factory just up the road that will employ 7500 people, and Toyota is building a battery factory outside Greensboro that'll employ 1750 people. But let's remember that House Bill 1049 would also create a job, for the person who goes around and rips out the free public chargers—until that's done, which would probably be the better part of a week.

And in fact, we could create even more jobs if we extended this philosophy to other public facilities that not everybody uses. Why should there be a library when I don't like books? Why are there schools? I'm not a kid. Don't get me started on all those roads that go places I've never been, and all those town fire trucks that haven't come to my house except for that one time. Maybe we don't tear all that stuff down, just as long as we can instill the general feeling that someone else is getting away with something.

I don't know about you, but I'm feeling it already."
"OneLove armband sends ‘very divisive message’, says Qatar official",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/28/onelove-armband-sends-very-divisive-message-says-qatar-official,nottheonion,"The head of Qatar’s World Cup organising committee has accused teams who wanted to wear the OneLove armband at the World Cup of sending a “very divisive message” to the Islamic and Arab world.

Hassan al-Thawadi’s comments came as the UK sports minister Stuart Andrew said he would wear the rainbow-coloured armband at the England v Wales match on Tuesday.

The Conservative frontbencher, who is gay, said it was “really unfair” that Fifa had threatened sporting sanctions at the 11th hour against seven European teams who had planned to wear the anti-discrimination symbol in Qatar, forcing them to protest in other ways.

“I want to show support and I was delighted to see that the German minister who attended a recent match has worn it, I think it is important that I do so,” he added.

However, Thawadi – secretary general of the supreme World Cup committee for delivery and legacy – said he had an “issue” with the armband because he saw it as a protest against Islamic values and an Islamic country hosting such a major event.

“If the teams decided to do it throughout the entire season, that is one thing,” he said, when asked if he felt nervous about armbands. “But if you’re coming to make a point, or a statement in Qatar, that is something I have an issue with. And it goes back to the simple fact that this is a part of the world that has its own set of values.

“This is not Qatar I’m talking about, it’s the Arab world,” he added. “For the teams to come and preach or make statements, that’s fine. But what you’re essentially saying is you’re protesting an Islamic country hosting an event. Where does that end? Does that mean no Islamic country can never be able to participate in anything?

“There’s going to be different values and different views coming in. So, for me, if you’re going to come specifically to make a statement here in Qatar – or specifically addressed to Qatar and by extension, the Islamic world – it leaves a very divisive message.”

Same-sex relationships are illegal in Qatar and while organisers and Fifa have repeated the message that “everyone is welcome” during the World Cup, it is unclear whether laws that criminalise acts such as kissing in public have been suspended.

Fans attending matches have also had rainbow items, including T-shirts and Wales bucket hats, confiscated by officials, before Fifa later said they should be allowed in stadiums.

But Thawadi said organisers only wanted visitors to respect the culture and religion of the region. “These values are regional,” he added. “It’s for the Islamic world, it’s for the Arab world, it’s for the Middle East. There are certain things that we will not agree upon. But let us find a way of coexisting and moving forward, one way or the other. That is where mutual respect is fundamental.”

In his interview with the TalkSport UK radio station, Thawadi also defended the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, for his pre-tournament remarks in which he said he felt Qatari, Arabic, African, gay and disabled, before warning western countries that they were in no position to give morality lessons to Qatar given their past and current behaviour.

“For a lot of people in Qatar and the Arab world what he said to a large extent reflected the frustration of 13 years being presented in a certain way in the media,” said Thawadi.

“A lot of Arabs that I’ve talked to have admired what he said. It addressed the fact that people did feel that the outside world is coming and passing judgment unequivocally on our part of the world – on us as people, on the Arab world and the Middle East.”"

San Francisco man gets red zone parking ticket after curb was repainted while his car was parked

SAN FRANCISCO -- A San Francisco man is fighting a ticket for parking in a red zone after the curb was repainted red, while his car was parked in the spot.

Desiree and Jeff Jolly have lived in the city for decades and know the challenges of finding a parking space in their Russian Hill neighborhood.

But there's a space at the corner of Larkin and Union streets that has always been their go-to.

""Well yeah, anytime it's open I've been parking here for 25 years,"" Jeff said.

But what happened to the pair one week ago was a first.

""We came out and we were walking up from the store, and I noticed the ticket on my car,"" Desiree said. Upon closer inspection, on the windshield of her Honda sedan was a $180 fine for parking in a red zone - one that Desiree and Jeff say wasn't there when she parked a couple of days earlier...or years past.

""If it was warranted I don't have a problem with it, but this seems unfair to me,"" she said.

""The red stripe is there, where it wasn't before, and they had the nerve to just to go around my tire,"" she described, pointing out a small patch the city's paint shop missed when they avoided painting the Honda's tire.

It's an amusing detail for Jeff who is a painter by trade.

""I saw that and I even have painter friends who say what a bad job that was. They missed a spot,"" he said, laughing.

ABC7 News, our sister station in San Francisco, spoke to Erica Kato, a spokesperson for SFMTA, who confirms the ticket is for a red zone violation. But in an interesting twist, it's not for the newly painted red stripe. The violation is for parking in an old faded one.

SFMTA provided a photo of the faded red zone parking spot to illustrate that the red zone did previously exist. While the curb in the image does show some red spots, they are very faint.

SFMTA also provided ABC7 News with the service request to repaint the stripe and an image showing how worn the red paint was.

ABC7 News examined that same spot using Google Maps street view images, and in several clear photos from 2016 and 2021, the red paint on the curb appears to have completely faded away so the curb looks completely gray.

Because the couple contested the ticket, SFMTA tells ABC7 News it's up to the citations clerk to determine what happens next. It could be enforced or dismissed. It's a process that could take up to 60 days.

""I'm going through chemotherapy right now, so it's like I'm worried about other things and now I have to worry about this,"" Desiree said.

Jeff and Desiree said after all the challenges of living in the city lately, including another vehicle-related drama where Jeff had a catalytic converter stolen, this could be their final straw.

""We do want to leave because of all of this stuff that goes on in the city,"" Jeff said.

They plan to say ""bonjour"" to moving to France sometime in the future."
US journalist ordered to change clothes after being told skirt too short to witness execution,https://news.sky.com/story/us-journalist-ordered-to-change-clothes-after-being-told-skirt-too-short-to-witness-execution-12661761,nottheonion,"A journalist was forced to change her outfit while attending the execution of a death-row inmate in Alabama after prison officials said her skirt was too short.

Ivana Hrynkiw Shatara, managing producer for website AL.com, says she was also told her open-toed shoes were too revealing by a member of staff at the Alabama Department of Corrections (ADOC).

Ms Hrynkiw Shatara was stopped as she arrived at the media centre at William C Holman Correctional Facility in the city of Atmore and told her outfit violated the prison dress code.

She visited the prison on 28 July to cover the execution of Joe Nathan James Jr, sentenced to death for killing his ex-girlfriend, Faith Hall, 26, in 1994.

In a statement shared on Twitter, the journalist said she had worn the same skirt to previous executions and other professional events ""without incident"", adding: ""I believe it is more than appropriate"".

""Tonight, a representative of the Alabama Department of Corrections told me publicly I couldn't view the execution because my skirt was too short,"" she wrote.

""At 5'7"", and 5'10"" with my heels on, I am a tall and long-legged person.

""I tried to pull my skirt to my hips to make the skirt longer, but was told it was still not appropriate.""

A photographer loaned Ms Hrynkiw Shatara his protective rain clothing, including waterproof wader trousers, which the ADOC deemed appropriate.

However, she then had to return to her car to swap her shoes after being told they were unsuitable.

""Despite wearing waders from a man I have never met and casual tennis shoes, I continued to do my job,"" she said.

But the incident left her feeling ""uncomfortable"", Ms Hrynkiw Shatara added.

""I felt embarrassed to have my body and my clothes questioned in front of a room of people I mostly had never met.

""I sat down, tried to stop blushing, and did my work. As women often have to.""

Another journalist, Kaitlyn Ross, responded to the tweet saying she too had been denied access to a government facility because her clothing was deemed to be ""too revealing"".

""It's exhausting to be a woman,"" she wrote.

""You did a great job under ridiculous circumstances. I'm sorry this happened.""

Editor in chief of the Alabama Media Group, which owns AL.com, described the treatment of Ms Hrynkiw Shatara as ""unacceptable"" and ""unequal"".

""I'm proud to work with Ivana, who despite this treatment, continued to report the story with professionalism to our audiences in Alabama,"" she said.

""This was sexist and an egregious breach of professional conduct. And it should not happen to any other reporter again.""

AL.com has sent a complaint to the ADOC as well as Alabama governor, Kay Ivey, and attorney general Steve Marshall.

The execution of Joe Nathan James by lethal injection was held up for three hours due to the amount of time it took to establish an intravenous line.

The delay was described as a ""highly unusual and very troubling"" time-lapse by the head of the Death Penalty Information Centre, a non-profit organisation focused on issues surrounding capital punishment.

He was executed despite pleas from the victim's relatives to spare his life.

Ms Hall's daughters, who were aged three and six when she died, said they have forgiven James and would prefer him to serve life behind bars.

But Governor Ivey declined to intervene and Mr Marshall advised an execution would ensure justice was served.

The execution sends an ""unmistakable message was sent that Alabama stands with victims of domestic violence"".

‘Gazpacho police’: Nazi gaffe lands Republican congresswoman in the soup,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/09/marjorie-taylor-greene-gazpacho-police,nottheonion,"The extremist Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene triggered a wave of viral jokes on Wednesday after ranting about the “gazpacho police” patrolling the Capitol building in Washington DC.

Greene was apparently mixing up the famously cold Spanish soup gazpacho with the Gestapo – the brutal Nazi-era secret police in Germany.

The Georgia congresswoman has made numerous bigoted statements and her spreading of Covid misinformation has seen her ousted from Twitter. She made the most recent comments in an interview on Real America with Dan Ball, produced by the rightwing One America News Network television channel.

“Not only do we have the DC jail which is the DC gulag, but now we have Nancy Pelosi’s gazpacho police spying on members of Congress, spying on the legislative work that we do, spying on our staff and spying on American citizens,” she said, referring to the Democratic speaker of the House.

Just to clear things up, @RepMTG

Greene did not explain why she thought Pelosi would form a police force inspired by gazpacho soup, nor why it would then carry out such extensive surveillance at the heart of American democracy.

Predictably, Greene’s apparent gaffe prompted a wave of internet hilarity and jokes.

“Gazpacho is a cold tomato soup. Gestapo is the Nazi police force. Neither of these things are right,” tweeted political journalist Jake Sherman.

“How dare MTG blame Gazpacho, when we all know that Vichyssoise Violence is the real culprit,” quipped podcast host Emily Brandwin.

Sarakshi Rai, a senior journalist at the Hill, added: “I was wondering why everybody in DC was tweeting about gazpacho and now I’m just craving some for dinner.”"
Kremlin To State Media: Show More Tucker Carlson,https://themountain.news/news/kremlin-to-state-media-show-more-tucker-carlson,nottheonion,"In the battle for hearts and minds, the Russian government has some advice to its state media outlets: show more Tucker Carlson.

“It is essential to use as much as possible fragments of broadcasts of the popular Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who sharply criticizes the actions of the United States [and] NATO, their negative role in unleashing the conflict in Ukraine, [and] the defiantly provocative behavior from the leadership of the Western countries and NATO towards the Russian Federation and towards President Putin, personally,” advises the 12-page document written in Russian. It sums up Carlson’s position: “Russia is only protecting its interests and security.” The memo includes a quote from Carlson: “And how would the US behave if such a situation developed in neighboring Mexico or Canada?” reports Mother Jones. The report came from Russia’s Department of Information and Telecommunications Support, which is part of the Russian security apparatus.

Carlson has taken to his show, Tucker Carlson Tonight, to side with the Kremlin in the information war. Carlson claimed on March 9th that the bogus report from the Kremlin that the United States set up biowarfare labs in Ukraine is “totally and completely true.” Tucker Carlson even attacked his coworker, national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin, for debunking the conspiracy theory. Carlson took to the air to attack Griffin in all but name:

“You know that the Pentagon talking points you saw reported as fact on television today — and last night — were an utter lie. Did the reporters who repeated those talking points verbatim know that they were a lie? Maybe they did. On the other hand, how would they know? They didn’t bother to do any reporting whatsoever… They got a text from some Biden administration flack and they just read it on the air like it was true. You shouldn’t be surprised because that’s what they do. And it’s possible that they’re afraid not to do that. They know if they stray from the script the White House has written for them, they’ll be denounced from the briefing room as tools of Putin,”

Carlson has also suggested that U.S. government officials wanted a war to occur between Russia and Ukraine after emergency powers enacted during Covid had come to an end. Carlson claimed the war allowed the U.S. government to shift focus and further “grab more power.” Tucker even claimed that the United States and the West encouraged the war with their support for admitting Ukraine into NATO.

While it is easy for many to dismiss Tucker Carlson as a right-wing pundit, he remains one of the most influential commentators in the American right and even beyond that demographic. Reports show that the viewership of other media outlets like MSNBC and CNN are in decline, with Fox News ascending. During the second quarter of 2020, Tucker Carlson Tonight garnered an average audience of 4.33 million viewers, the largest for any program in the history of cable news. Fox makes up 56% of the total prime-time audience in cable news and 55% during the day. Alarmingly, Tucker Carlson’s brand of skepticism towards Washington is attracting many Democrats. According to the party-line data, gathered in the month of October, Tucker Carlson is the number-one watched host among Democrats in the key 25-54 age demographic – across all networks. For that month, Carlson pulled in an average of 101,000 Democrats in the demographic. The Rachel Maddow Show and The Five tied for second – each pulling in 88,000 demographic viewers that identify as Democrats, reports Mediate. Many Democrats may take the support of their party members in only consuming liberal media for granted. It appears many Democrats are tuning into Tucker, giving Fox News's champion a listen.

It appears that one of America’s most prolific media personalities has captured the attention of the Kremlin. They look at Carlson and see an ally in peddling their narrative of a peaceful war in Ukraine. Not only will this trickle down into Carlson’s base, Republicans dissatisfied with Trump losing the 2020 election and the current leader in Washington, but also risks changing the opinions of many Democrats who could be pivotal voters in 2022 and 2024."
British lawmaker Neil Parish to resign after watching porn in the House of Commons,https://www.npr.org/2022/04/30/1095759573/british-mp-porn-house-of-commons-neil-parish-resigns,nottheonion,"British lawmaker Neil Parish resigning after watching porn in the House of Commons

Neil Parish, a Conservative Party member of Parliament, says he is resigning after admitting he watched pornography twice in the House of Commons in a ""moment of madness.""

The first time was accidental, he told the BBC. It happened after he was looking at tractors. But the second time, it was intentional.

""... Funnily enough it was tractors I was looking at,"" he told BBC. ""I did get into another website that had a very similar name and I watched it for a bit which I shouldn't have done. But my crime — biggest crime — is that on another occasion I went in a second time.""

Two female colleagues said they saw Parish looking at porn from his phone, while they were sitting near him. The Conservative Party suspended him Friday over the allegations.

In a statement Friday, Parish said he will cooperate with any investigation.

""Following recent allegations regarding an MP's use of their mobile phone in Parliament, I have referred myself to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards in the House of Commons,"" Parish wrote in a statement.

In response to the Parish incident, Labour's shadow leader of the Commons, Thangam Debbonaire, criticized the way the Conservative Party handled it.

""The Conservatives knew for days about the disgusting behaviour of one of their MPs and tried to cover it up... This is a government rotting from the head down.""

It's the latest in a string of sexual misconduct allegations in Parliament

The incident is the latest sexual misconduct allegation in British politics.

Earlier this month, Conservative member of Parliament Imran Ahmad Khan resigned after he was found guilty of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old in 2008.

""I don't know how to express the shock of the past three days,"" Khan wrote in a statement on his resignation. ""I have been characterised as a sexual predator, outcast and worse.""

He said he plans to appeal the verdict and withdraw from ""political life.""

Khan is also at the center of bullying allegations. Former staff members allege he frequently screamed at his employees, Politico reported.

David Warburton, another Conservative in Parliament, was suspended from the party this month after sexual harassment and cocaine use allegations. And last year, Conservative lawmaker Rob Roberts was suspended from the party after a parliamentary investigation found he had sexually harassed a staff member, the BBC reported."
"Fox News CEO warned against 'crazies' after 2020 election, Dominion says",https://www.npr.org/2022/10/06/1127149958/fox-news-ceo-warned-against-crazies-after-2020-election-dominion-says,nottheonion,"Fox News CEO warned against 'crazies' after 2020 election, Dominion says

Enlarge this image toggle caption Fox News Fox News

Besieged by angry viewers, denounced by then-President Trump, questioned by some of its own stars, Fox News found itself in a near-impossible spot on Election Night 2020 after its election-analysis team announced before any other network that Joe Biden would win the pivotal swing state of Arizona.

Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott proved so flummoxed by what ensued that she warned colleagues, ""We can't give the crazies an inch.""

That's according to the account of a lawyer for Dominion Voting Systems, which is seeking $1.6 billion from Fox in a defamation suit over false allegations on the network that the company committed election fraud. A trial date is set for April in Delaware.

The voting machine and technology company's attorney, Justin Nelson, revealed Scott's remarks in a court proceeding earlier this week, in which he argued that Dominion's legal team is entitled to receive the employment contracts of 13 Fox News executives, including Scott. She has served as CEO since 2018. (Dominion is also suing Fox Corp., the network's parent company.)

In a ruling Wednesday, Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric M. Davis affirmed that Dominion should receive the contracts — the point of contention in the hearing.

For days after the election, Trump and his top aides demanded the network rescind its announcement of Biden's victory in Arizona, even pressuring the network's controlling owners, Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch. In the weeks that followed, a cadre of Fox News stars hosted Trump's advisers — and even Trump himself — to peddle baseless conspiracy theories of election fraud. Many of those false claims asserted without evidence that Dominion's technology and machines had been used to rig the vote and to cheat Trump out of the White House.

According to Nelson's remarks at the hearing, senior Fox News executives interceded to try to block Fox Business stars Lou Dobbs and Maria Bartiromo from having Trump's campaign attorneys, Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani, on their shows to repeat such lies. In late 2020, Dobbs and Bartiromo hosted Trump's advocates to make those accusations.

Fox's attorney, Justin Keller, did not dispute the remarks attributed by Nelson to Fox News CEO Scott. Nor did he deny that executives sought to intervene in the two programs' efforts to book Powell and Giuliani even though their claims had been discredited. Instead, he made a broader argument against allowing scrutiny of the executives' contracts, saying that was unnecessary given how many documents the network has already turned over to Dominion.

Why Dominion hopes Fox News CEO's warning could help make its case

Fox News and its chief trial attorney, Dan Webb, declined to comment for this article, as did Dominion's lawyers. However, the arguments that played out during a hearing Tuesday reflected a looking-glass world: Dominion depicted the network's executives as scrambling to rein in the chaos engendered by its stars, while Fox's attorneys were effectively arguing the executives had little time, ability or inclination to do so.

In his exchanges with the judge, Keller, the Fox attorney, drew a line distinguishing between a host or producer ""who are sometimes pre-scripting material for the show that is going to be tethered to a specific channel's telecast"" and a network executive.

""That person is going to be far removed from the day-to-day operations of editorial control and discretion over the particular channel's telecast,"" he said.

Beyond Scott, the executives whose contracts are being sought include Jay Wallace, Fox News' president and executive editor, and Meade Cooper, the executive vice president of primetime programming.

Nelson, the Dominion attorney, retorted by citing a document obtained from Fox that ""talks about the daily editorial meeting that occurs, including almost all of these executives that we're looking at right now.""

Dominion appears to be drilling down on its argument — hotly disputed by Fox — that the network's executives knowingly allowed such false conspiracies to air on its programs to boost their audiences because their pro-Trump viewers had abandoned them after the Arizona call.

Under U.S. Supreme Court rulings, Dominion has to prove Fox demonstrated ""actual malice"" to win a defamation case. That means either knowingly broadcasting false and damaging information, or doing so with reckless disregard for the truth.

""Fox sought to profit off a lie. That's the allegation,"" Judge Davis summarized. ""Whether that's true or not, we'll stay for the trial.""

A new book reveals how Fox journalists acted behind scenes

In their new book on Trump, The Divider, journalists Peter Baker and Susan Glasser reveal that Fox anchor Bret Baier cited intense pressure from Trump's team to explore whether and under what circumstances the Arizona call could be reversed. Fox did not withdraw its projection. The authors also reported that Wallace, the head of news, overruled his election-analysis desk and instructed his anchors to not announce that Biden had won Nevada, too.

What ensued involved a split screen. Fox became the last network to project Biden's win of the presidency despite being the first to make the Arizona call that proved accurate. And while its reporters often unraveled election fraud allegations, many of Fox's biggest stars tolerated, amplified and even embraced them, Dominion's lawyers noted.

No one at Fox would directly comment on Baker and Glasser's assertions, other than Baier, who released a statement taking some issue with how his objections were framed. One person inside Fox with direct knowledge of its election coverage told NPR the delay in calling the full White House win for Biden involved a technical glitch in a control room as one show transitioned to the next at the top of the hour.

In hosting Fox's first post-election interview with Trump that November, Bartiromo echoed Trump's disproven allegations of electoral fraud, saying, ""This is disgusting and we cannot allow America's election to be corrupted."" She told viewers in mid-December that ""an intel source"" told her that Trump had won the election. Bartiromo, officially designated as a news anchor, never returned to explain on what grounds the source made that statement. (Fox no longer publicly characterizes her as an anchor, which had rooted her in the news side of Fox, as opposed to an opinion host.)

In December 2020, Dobbs contended on the air that Trump's opponents within the government had committed ""treason,"" and later suggested any action by a Republican officeholder to uphold Biden's victory might have been ""criminal."" His departure from the network was hastily announced the day after another election-software company, Smartmatic, filed its own $2.7 billion lawsuit against Fox for defamation surrounding similarly false accusations of fraud. That case is not as far along in the process.

Fox News' lawyers argue Trump's claims on election fraud — even though false — are 'inherently newsworthy'

Fox has dismissed both suits as efforts to stifle legitimate coverage of inherently newsworthy allegations - election fraud — made by inherently newsworthy people — including the then-sitting U.S. president and his top campaign advisers. Fox never did back down from its projection of Arizona for Biden, its original sin in the eyes of Trump and his campaign. As viewers abandoned the network for harder-edged fare on Newsmax, OANN and elsewhere, some Fox stars served up incendiary rhetoric and challenged the legitimacy of Biden's pending certification in early January.

Even so, under Scott and her team, Fox fired former political director Chris Stirewalt weeks after the election. The network also announced the retirement of Washington Managing Editor Bill Sammon — who is among the executives whose contracts were sought by Dominion. Both men had been involved in the decision to project Biden's win in Arizona. Other digital reporters were laid off too. And the network shifted to give a greater emphasis to opinion, turning over two hours of programming that had been reserved for news reports to shows led by Jesse Watters and Greg Gutfeld.

In recent weeks, Dominion has argued that Fox host Jeanine Pirro — a former district attorney and New York state judge, as well as a Trump confidant — sits at the heart of its case. NPR previously revealed the existence of an anguished email from a Fox News producer begging colleagues to keep Pirro off the air because she was circulating lies about election fraud from dark corners of the internet.

Dominion's legal team asked the court to compel additional testimony from Pirro late last month, after Fox invoked a reporter's privilege to shield her from some questions during her deposition. A ruling on whether Pirro must return for questioning has not been made public.

As with the Scott admonition about ""the crazies,"" Dominion's legal team is seeking to use those exchanges to show that Fox knowingly allowed Dobbs, Pirro, Bartiromo and their guests to peddle false claims that defamed the company and set the country on edge ahead of the Jan. 6, 2021 siege of the U.S. Capitol.

According to filings reviewed by NPR, Dominion is also asking the court to compel additional testimony from Fox star Sean Hannity, a close adviser to Trump. Dominion's attorneys are seeking to bar ""improper assertions of reporter's privilege,"" arguing that Fox inappropriately asserted reporter's privilege for Hannity during earlier questioning as well, though the full filing is sealed. He was deposed in late August, according to court records.

Fox News has repeatedly defended its conduct by invoking the importance of free-speech principles bound up in the First Amendment, saying the Smartmatic and Dominion cases are attempts to chill independent reporting and commentary.

Fox Corp. CEO and Executive Chairman Lachlan Murdoch has taken a seemingly conflicting stance halfway across the globe in Australia, where the media magnate and his family now live. A political columnist for the magazine Crikey accused the Murdochs of being ""unindicted co-conspirators"" in the insurrection at the U.S. Congress by Trump supporters because of the false fraud allegations and the hyper-charged rhetoric ahead of the planned rally.

In that case, Murdoch is accusing a much smaller media outlet of defamation. He has forced the site to pay out for highly critical commentary several times previously; Crikey says it intends to use the suit as a test case for recent changes in libel law in that country. Media outlets have less legal cover in Australia than they do here in the U.S.

Minnesota lawmakers voted to legalize THC edibles. Some did it accidentally,https://www.npr.org/2022/07/02/1109576113/minnesota-thc-edibles-accident-delta-8,nottheonion,"Minnesota lawmakers voted to legalize THC edibles. Some did it accidentally

Enlarge this image toggle caption Gillian Flaccus/AP Gillian Flaccus/AP

A new Minnesota law lets people 21 and over buy and consume food and beverages with a small amount of hemp-derived THC, but some legislators might not have fully understood the bill before passing it.

The new law says food and beverages cannot contain more than 5 milligrams of hemp-derived THC per serving and no more than 50 milligrams per package.

Although marijuana-derived THC is still illegal in Minnesota, THC derived from hemp is chemically the same. Marijuana and hemp come from the same cannabis plant, though the plants are bred differently, with marijuana plants high in THC and hemp plants very low in THC.

THC, or delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol, is the chemical that causes the high of marijuana.

The nature of the Republican-controlled Senate, which has opposed recreational marijuana legalization efforts in the past, raises questions about whether the legalization was accidental.

Minnesota state Sen. Jim Abeler, a Republican from Anoka, told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune he did not realize this law would allow THC-infused edibles of any kind and thought it would only apply to delta-8 THC products.

Delta-8 THC, which is similar to the standard delta-9 THC, has not been extensively researched or understood, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Delta-8 is found naturally in cannabis plants but in trace amounts. Delta-8 also does not produce the same amount of ""high"" as delta-9.

But because of a technicality, delta-8 is considered federally legal and is often available at gas stations and convenience stores. Lawmakers in Minnesota had sought to regulate this market.

After an amendment passed unanimously during a Minnesota legislative session in May, state Sen. Abeler jokingly said: ""That doesn't legalize marijuana — we just didn't do that, did we?""

When Abeler proceeded to laugh, Rep. Tina Liebling, a Democrat from Rochester, said, ""Oh, are you kidding? Of course you have. No, just kidding. Next, we'll do that next, OK?"""
"Rush to recruit police officers risks hiring racists and criminals, warns watchdog",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/10/major-shortcomings-in-england-and-wales-policing-persist-watchdog-says,nottheonion,"Boris Johnson’s promise to hire 20,000 more police officers has increased the risk of introducing misogynist and racist recruits, a police watchdog has said, amid concerns that a discriminatory culture exists in forces across England and Wales.

Sir Tom Winsor, in his ninth and final annual review, said that police must confront a series of problems, including the aftermath of Sarah Everard’s murder by a police officer, if damage to public confidence is be restored.

The report comes a month after Dame Cressida Dick’s resignation as Met commissioner which followed a damning inquiry by another police watchdog into a culture of violently misogynist, racist and homophobic messages at Charing Cross police station in central London.

Winsor reiterated warnings that the “sheer magnitude and speed” of the recruitment campaign to hire 20,000 police officers “inevitably carries risks”, adding that there is a “heightened danger that people unsuited to policing may get through and be recruited”.

He said in too many cases the system “fails” when, on occasion, organised crime groups try to infiltrate the police which can have “catastrophic consequences”.

“When unsuitable applicants lie on their application forms, conceal their social media activity or play down their criminal connections, the quality of vetting needs to be consistently high,” he said.

“If during the probationary period, a constable displays behaviour like homophobia, racism, misogyny or dishonesty, it’s necessary to take that really seriously. If they just say ‘well, he’s going to be a good cop, we’ll knock off the rough edges’, you’re storing up a problem that could last for 30 years.”

Johnson pledged in 2019 to recruit an extra 20,000 police officers. Police numbers had dropped by more than 20,000 since 2010.

Asked about the scale of problems with culture and behaviour in policing, Winsor told reporters at a briefing on Thursday: “I don’t think that what we saw in Charing Cross police station is limited to London. But we don’t have evidence yet of just how widespread that is.

“I think these matters are taken very seriously … by all police forces. And while what has happened recently is London-centric, it is not London-limited in all probability.”

Revealing how a regional chief constable had told him within the last fortnight “we have this problem too”, without disclosing their identity, he added: “I expect that there are pockets of those things in other parts of the country.

“How much and how bad it is, we don’t know at the moment.”

His comments follow the release of a wide-ranging report that also says:

Fraud has “exploded” and continues to be wrongly treated as a low priority by many forces.

The model of local accountability, involving police and crime commissioners, has fractured some relationships between police and politicians, and left some chief constables lacking in confidence in their operational independence.

The “fragile architecture” of having 43 police forces, devised in 1962 and implemented in 1974, is “very far from fit for purpose” in the 2020s.

Online crime is now by far the most prevalent type of crime. “It used to be that our children were unsafe if they were out on the streets. They’re now more unsafe in their own bedrooms,” he said.

Public expectations to fight crime cannot be met without sufficient funding and “the public through their politicians must decide how much threat, harm and risk they are prepared to tolerate”.

Winsor said: “Major shortcomings in policing persist, and these need to be addressed. Criminality is often now complex and far more sophisticated, and investigations can take far longer. If the police continue to use 20th-century methods to try to cope with 21st-century technology, they will continue to fall further and further behind,” he said.

Speaking to the BBC last month, the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, claimed the prime minister was correct to leave out fraud when quoting statistics stating crime had decreased, because fraud is not a “crime that people experience in their day-to-day lives”.

Winsor said it was “wrong” for politicians to leave fraud out of crime statistics. “Fraud needs to be taken far more seriously.

“It is indefensibly a low priority for the police. It is a tsunami of offending which can, and does, lead to catastrophic human suffering and some people destroy themselves when they’ve lost everything they’ve ever worked for,” he said.

The report comes at the end of Winsor’s 10-year stint in the job, which ends in this month.

He said: “As I reflect on the past decade in policing, I commend the courage and commitment of police officers and staff across the country.

“The severity of the problems that our police service now faces should not be underestimated, but the public should be reassured by the strong, pragmatic and professional approach of police officers and staff.”"
'Fictosexual' Japanese man no longer able to communicate with hologram he married,https://www.foxnews.com/world/fictosexual-man-no-longer-able-communicate-with-hologram-married,nottheonion,"A ""fictosexual"" Japanese man who married a hologram in 2018 recently told a Japanese newspaper that their relationship is struggling with communication.

Akihiko Kondo, 38, who works at a middle school in a Tokyo suburb, married Hatsune Miku, a hologram that was created by a computer as singing software, on Nov. 4, 2018, in a wedding that cost more than $17,000.

As one of the thousands of ""fictosexuals,"" Kondo is attracted to fictional characters.

Kondo first interacted with Miku using Gatebox, a $1,300 device that projected fictional characters into a cylinder and allowed users to communicate via artificial intelligence and marry them unofficially.

When he proposed to her in the cylinder, Miku reportedly replied, ""I hope you'll cherish me.""

MAN, 35, REPORTEDLY MARRIES COMPUTER HOLOGRAM

Since their marriage in 2018, Gatebox technology no longer exists, which Kondo said has complicated their relationship, but not lessened his feelings.

""My love for Miku hasn’t changed,"" he told Japanese paper Mainichi, which recounted how he walks around with a life-size version of the doll. ""I held the wedding ceremony because I thought I could be with her forever.""

Remembering what caused him to withdraw into a world where he would marry a fictitious character, Kondo told Newshub, ""It's not that people can't live in society because they're engrossed in a two-dimensional world, but rather, there are cases where people become captivated as they search for a place for themselves in video games and anime because reality is too painful for them.""

""I was one of those people. People who don't understand the background probably think, 'Games are disrupting their lives,' but that's not the case,"" he added.

Kondo was reportedly bullied at work and fell into a depression in 2008 when he first stumbled upon Miku and realized human relationships weren't for him. He credits the Vocaloid software voicebank with pulling him out of his depression.

""I stayed in my room for 24 hours a day, and watched videos of Miku the whole time,"" he recalled to Mainichi.

Japan’s newly appointed digital minister is waging war on floppy disks. Companies fear the fax machine could be next,https://fortune.com/2022/09/05/japan-digital-minister-waging-war-floppy-disks-companies-fear-fax-machine-next/,nottheonion,"From the outside, Japan, the third largest economy in the world after the U.S. and China, is seen as one of the most technologically advanced societies in the world. Inside the country, its government and businesses are still using floppy disks.

But this will likely soon come to an end as Taro Kono—the social-media-savvy prime ministerial hopeful who was appointed digital minister in last month’s cabinet reshuffle—has declared war on the disk storage that’s only continued relevance in most of the West is limited to the use off its digital image as a save icon.

Digital Minister declares a war on floppy discs.

There are about 1900 government procedures that requires business community to use discs, i. e. floppy disc, CD, MD, etc to submit applications and other forms. Digital Agency is to change those regulations so you can use online. — KONO Taro (@konotaromp) August 31, 2022

According to Kono, about 1,900 government procedures still require the business community to use floppy discs to submit applications and other forms. A standard 3.5-inch floppy disk can usually hold around 1.44MB of storage, or around 10 seconds of a 480p video.

With the arrival of the Internet and the existence of cloud storage, Kono is trying to retire the 40-year-old technology, which continues to be used in Japan due to the country’s strict regulations around how data can be transferred within the government bureaucracy.

The Japanese “Digital Agency is to change those regulations so you can use online,” Kono tweeted.

At a news conference last week, Kono also criticized the country’s lingering use of other outdated technology. “I’m looking to get rid of the fax machine, and I still plan to do that,” he said.

Tortoise-pace change

The urgency to replace the floppy disk and the fax machine comes as Japan drives to establish a digital national ID system, which citizens could use to electronically sign online tax submissions, apply online for other government services, and use for online banking logins and transaction signing.

Kono has argued on his blog that a digital ID system is needed as municipalities faced difficulty in distributing emergency benefits to citizens during the COVID-19 pandemic; citizens were required to attach a copy of their passport and bank account information to receive benefits.

Japan’s stubborn reliance on the fax machine during the COVID-19 pandemic was criticized by doctors who had to complete paperwork on each new coronavirus infections by hand. One doctor went on a Twitter tirade and called the practice “Showa period stuff”, referring to the imperial era that ran from 1926 until the death of Emperor Hirohito in 1989.

Kono has also argued that Japan’s reliance on the fax machine and the centuries-old practice of stamping one’s name with a hanko stamp seal has been a “hindrance to telework” policies during the COVID-19 pandemic.

During stay-at-home orders in April 2020, workers were still commuting to the office to physically stamp contracts and papers with custom hanko seals.

C’mon, there is no analogue thing left in our remarkably advanced society.

Oops, my fax machine is jamming! https://t.co/jdN81icZg0 — KONO Taro (@konotaromp) August 11, 2022

Kono’s greatest challenge in overhauling the Japanese technological system will likely be its aging population. Japan has the world’s oldest society, with 28.7 % of the population 65 or older. The population has more than 80,000 people over the age of 100 on top of a rapidly declining birth rate, according to a 2020 report by the European Parliament.

Japan’s cyber-security minister Yoshitaka Sakurada admitted in 2018 when he was appointed to the role that he has never used a computer. And when most of the West shrugged after Microsoft announced it would discontinue Internet Explorer, Japan panicked; around 49% of companies in Japan were still using the browser as of March 2022.

The floppy disk

Kono asked a press conference last Tuesday “where does one even buy a floppy disk these days?”

The question is valid as there is virtually no company that still manufacturs them. One of the largest floppy disk makers, Sony, ended its production of floppy discs more than a decade ago, in 2010.

No computer manufactured today has a port to input a floppy disk and according to a report from YouGov, two-thirds of children in the U.K. below the age of 18 don’t even know what a floppy disk is."
'It was not a crime': Denver man faces felony after city accuses him of making pickleball court without permission,https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/it-was-not-a-crime-denver-man-faces-felony-after-city-accuses-him-of-making-pickleball-court-without-permission,nottheonion,"DENVER — A 71-year-old Denver man is facing a felony charge after city officials say he made a pickleball court without permission. With prosecution on the table, some believe the punishment doesn't fit the crime.

""The whole pickleball community is really saddened and shocked,"" said Jan Devor, a friend of 71-year-old Arslan Guney and fellow pickleball player.

Guney and others use a basketball court at Denver's Central Park Recreation Center for pickleball. Last Monday, the markings on the court had faded, so Guney re-marked them with a Sharpie.

Three days later, an arrest warrant for felony criminal mischief was issued for Guney. The court document also claims ten thousand dollars in damages.

Guney also received an email notifying him his Denver Parks and Recreation membership had been suspended indefinitely.

The game — a mix of tennis, racquetball and ping-pong — is one Guney has played for years, according to close friends. Devor said she and others are appalled, shocked and saddened by the situation.

""He is what we call the mayor of pickleball,"" Devor said. ""He is an expert player himself but always takes time to slow down his game... to teach others to play with people of any ability. I have 40 letters that have been given to me that I'm submitting to the lawyer that attest to his kindness and his generosity. He has written a letter to Denver Parks and Recreation apologizing.""

Devor went on to say her friend was devastated by the ordeal.

According to her and others in the pickleball community, apologies have not been enough. Now, Guney is represented by Hollynd Hoskins, an attorney who happens to be a pickleball player herself.

""This community is willing to remove the marks, hire a contractor to do it safely, to apologize, to volunteer with the community, but this is outrageous,"" Hoskins said.

Denver Parks and Recreation declined to sit down for an interview with Denver7. Instead, they provided an statement:

""It is our duty and responsibility to the citizens of Denver to protect city assets and public property. Defacing or damaging public property is unacceptable, a criminal offense and will not be tolerated in any of our public buildings or spaces. Law enforcement is aware of the damage and the incident is being investigated. Pickleball play was temporarily suspended to assess the damage and related repairs.""

A spokesperson added pickleball play has since resumed.

Hoskins said she is now trying to get the arrest warrant turned into a court summons so Guney can avoid jail time.

""The community wants answers but we, again, we want to sit down and work this out, reach a resolution,"" Hoskins said. ""This was an incredible misunderstanding and a mistake. It was not a crime.""

""The courts should be saved for real criminal matters, not for matters like this,"" Devor said.

Guney turned himself in on Thursday morning. His attorney, Hollynd Hoskins, said the district attorney agreed to a personal recognizance bond for Guney around 3:30 p.m. Thursday.

Hoskins said Guney would be released in 6-8 hours from then if court proceedings are functioning as normal.

Former judges who sent kids to jail for kickbacks must pay more than $200 million,https://www.npr.org/2022/08/18/1118108084/michael-conahan-mark-ciavarella-kids-for-cash,nottheonion,"Former judges who sent kids to jail for kickbacks must pay more than $200 million

Enlarge this image toggle caption Mark Moran/AP Mark Moran/AP

Two former Pennsylvania judges who orchestrated a scheme to send children to for-profit jails in exchange for kickbacks were ordered to pay more than $200 million to hundreds of people they victimized in one of the worst judicial scandals in U.S. history.

U.S. District Judge Christopher Conner awarded $106 million in compensatory damages and $100 million in punitive damages to nearly 300 people in a long-running civil suit against the judges, writing the plaintiffs are ""the tragic human casualties of a scandal of epic proportions.""

In what came to be known as the kids-for-cash scandal, Mark Ciavarella and another judge, Michael Conahan, shut down a county-run juvenile detention center and accepted $2.8 million in illegal payments from the builder and co-owner of two for-profit lockups. Ciavarella, who presided over juvenile court, pushed a zero-tolerance policy that guaranteed large numbers of kids would be sent to PA Child Care and its sister facility, Western PA Child Care.

Ciavarella ordered children as young as 8 to detention, many of them first-time offenders deemed delinquent for petty theft, jaywalking, truancy, smoking on school grounds and other minor infractions. The judge often ordered youths he had found delinquent to be immediately shackled, handcuffed and taken away without giving them a chance to put up a defense or even say goodbye to their families.

""Ciavarella and Conahan abandoned their oath and breached the public trust,"" Conner wrote Tuesday in his explanation of the judgment. ""Their cruel and despicable actions victimized a vulnerable population of young people, many of whom were suffering from emotional issues and mental health concerns.""

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court threw out some 4,000 juvenile convictions involving more than 2,300 kids after the scheme was uncovered.

It's unlikely the now-adult victims will see even a fraction of the eye-popping damages award, but a lawyer for the plaintiffs said it's a recognition of the enormity of the disgraced judges' crimes.

""It's a huge victory,"" Marsha Levick, co-founder and chief counsel of the Philadelphia-based Juvenile Law Center and a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said Wednesday. ""To have an order from a federal court that recognizes the gravity of what the judges did to these children in the midst of some of the most critical years of their childhood and development matters enormously, whether or not the money gets paid.""

Another plaintiffs' attorney, Sol Weiss, said he would begin a probe of the judges' assets, but did not think they had any money to pay a judgment.

Ciavarella, 72, is serving a 28-year prison sentence in Kentucky. His projected release date is 2035.

Conahan, 70, was sentenced to more than 17 years in prison but was released to home confinement in 2020 — with six years left on his sentence — because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Conner ruled after hearing often-emotional testimony last year from 282 people who appeared in Luzerne County juvenile court between 2003 and 2008 — 79 of whom were under 13 when Ciavarella sent them to juvenile detention — and 32 parents.

""They recounted his harsh and arbitrary nature, his disdain for due process, his extraordinary abruptness, and his cavalier and boorish behavior in the courtroom,"" Conner wrote.

One unnamed child victim testified that Ciavarella had ""ruined my life"" and ""just didn't let me get to my future,"" according to Conner's ruling.

Said another plaintiff: ""I feel I was just sold out for no reason. Like everybody just stood in line to be sold.""

Another victim described how he shook uncontrollably during a routine traffic stop — a consequence of the traumatizing impact of his childhood detention — and had to show his mental health records in court to ""explain why my behavior was so erratic.""

Several of the childhood victims who were part of the lawsuit when it began in 2009 have since died from overdoses or suicide, Conner said.

To calculate compensatory damages, the judge decided each plaintiff was entitled to a base rate of $1,000 for each day of wrongful detention, and adjusted that amount based on the circumstances of each case. Substantial punitive damages were warranted because the disgraced judges inflicted ""unspeakable physical and emotional trauma"" on children and adolescents, Conner wrote.

The damages award only covers plaintiffs who chose to participate in process.

Other major figures in the case settled years ago, including the builder and the owner of the private lockups and their companies, in payouts totaling about $25 million."

St. Louis couple who waved guns at protesters want weapons back,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/st-louis-couple-waved-guns-protesters-want-weapons-back-rcna11166,nottheonion,"ST. LOUIS — The city of St. Louis has not destroyed guns seized months ago from the couple who made headlines by waving the weapons at racial injustice protesters, and the couple is trying to get them back.

Robert Dierker of the City Counselor’s Office told a judge during a virtual hearing Wednesday that the guns taken in 2020 from Mark and Patricia McCloskey have not been disposed of, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.

“Obviously with our customary efficiency, we should have destroyed (the weapons) months ago,” Dierker said. “We haven’t. So McCloskey’s a beneficiary of bureaucratic, I want to say, ineptitude. But in any event, it’s fortuitous that the weapons still exist.”

The McCloskeys, both lawyers in their 60s, said they felt threatened by the protesters who walked onto their private street during global protests that followed the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Mark McCloskey emerged from his home with an AR-15-style rifle, and Patricia McCloskey waved a semi-automatic pistol.

Photos and cellphone video captured the confrontation, which drew widespread attention and made the couple heroes to some and villains to others. No shots were fired, and no one was hurt.

The use of weapons led to charges and the McCloskeys both pleaded guilty in June to misdemeanors. As part of the plea, they voluntarily gave up the guns. Republican Gov. Mike Parson granted pardons weeks later.

Mark McCloskey, who is running for the U.S. Senate as a Republican, sued St. Louis, the city sheriff and state to get back the guns. He said during Wednesday’s hearing that the pardons also entitle the couple to a refund of their fines.

“The loss of that property would certainly be a legal disqualification, impediment or other legal disadvantage, of which I have now been absolved by the governor, and therefore the state no longer has any legitimate reason to hold the property,” McCloskey said.

The City Counselor’s Office contends that Parson’s pardon obliterated the conviction, but not the plea agreement in which McCloskey forfeited the guns.

Circuit Judge Joan Moriarty took the case under advisement."

Chris Pratt’s Mario Voice Baffles Fans After First Listen: ‘Holy S— It’s Literally Just Chris Pratt’s Voice’,https://variety.com/2022/film/news/chris-pratt-mario-voice-backlash-fans-confused-movie-trailer-1235395306/,nottheonion,"The trailer for Universal Pictures and Nintendo’s “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” has debuted, bringing with it a first listen of Chris Pratt’s Mario voice. The actor told Variety earlier this year that he “worked really closely with the directors” to craft the perfect Mario voice, adding, “[We tried] out a few things and landed on something that I’m really proud of.”

So what does Pratt’s Mario voice sound like? He only gets two brief lines of dialogue in the trailer (“What is this place?” and “Mushroom Kingdom, here we come!”), but it was enough to send social media into a craze with reactions. Many users found Pratt’s Mario voice too similar to Pratt’s own speaking voice, which led to confusion as the actor previously touted the voice as “unlike anything” fans had heard before.

“It’s an animated voiceover narrative,” Pratt added to Variety about the role. “It’s not a live-action movie. I’m not gonna be wearing a plumber suit running all over. I’m providing a voice for an animated character, and it is updated and unlike anything you’ve heard in the Mario world before.”

“Just showed the boys the Mario trailer,” The Telegraph film critic Robbie Cullin wrote. “The way they turned around and looked at me when Chris Pratt’s voice piped up is going to be making me laugh for months, if not years.”

In addition to Pratt, “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” also stars Charlie Day as Luigi, Anya Taylor-Joy as Princess Peach, Seth Rogen as Donkey Kong, Jack Black as Bowser, Keegan-Michael Key as Toad, Fred Armisen as Cranky Kong and Sebastian Maniscalco as Spike.

Nintendo partnered on the film with Illumination Entertainment, the studio behind hit movies like the “Despicable Me,” “Minions” and “Sing” films. “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” opens in theaters April 7, 2023.

The judge ruled that the girl, ""high after an excessive use of alcohol caused the young man to approach"".

The pair went to the toilet of a central Turin pub together in May 2019 and she left the door ajar, ""behaviour which was an invitation to dare"" on the young man's part.

Petition Started To Block James Corden From Coming Back To The UK Because Brits Don’t Want Him,https://www.indiatvnews.com/trending/news/james-corden-should-not-return-to-uk-netizens-start-online-petition-to-stop-him-but-why-2022-06-16-785004,nottheonion,"Follow us on Image Source : INSTAGRAM/JAMES CORDEN James Corden

""James Corden should not return to UK,"" an online petition urges as the actor-comedian is set to return back to the United Kingdom after he wraps on 'The Late Late Show' next spring. The petition is sort of mean and describes the comedian as a “gargantuan twat”. It has gone viral on social media and Internet users are kind of perplexed about how to react to it. It is being widely shared across social media platforms drawing hilarious reactions. The application is very mean and nasty. It says since the UK has endured so much they want to keep Corden out of the country.

The petition begins as, “Eight years ago, James Corden left the UK for the US to work on [The Late Late Show], since then, we’ve had to collectively deal with the impact of the Tory government, Brexit, and COVID-19.” It goes on to refer to the absence of James Corden as a “slight beacon of hope”. Continuing further it states, “But now he’s leaving [The Late Late Show] and is returning to our British pastures. So I beg you, if you do one thing today, please, I implore you to sign this petition,” adding, “If he really has to return to the UK, can we stick him on some little uninhabited island off the coast of Scotland?” Here's how netizens are reacting to it:

Meanwhile, Corden hasn't yet discussed his next moves after leaving 'The Late Late Show,' which he's hosted since mid-2015, but insiders have suggested that the presenter is keen to return to his native England to be closer to family, as per Variety.

In a shocking announcement in April this year, Corden had first revealed his plans of stepping down. ""This will be my last year hosting the show,"" Corden said at the time.

""When I started this journey, it was always going to be just that. It was going to be a journey, an adventure. I never saw it as my final destination, you know? And I never want this show to overstay its welcome in any way. I always want to love making it. And I really think in a year from now that will be a good time to move on and see what else might be out there... this has been the hardest decision I've ever had to make, it really has. I've never taken this job for granted.""

A return to the United Kingdom would be an interesting move for Corden, who had a relatively successful acting career on shows like BBC sitcom 'Gavin & Stacey' and 'The Wrong Mans,' and on stage with the National Theatre's 'One Man, Two Guvnors'.

Former San Diego Vice Squad Officer Charged with Running Prostitution Ring,https://www.occrp.org/en/daily/16662-former-san-diego-vice-squad-officer-charged-with-running-prostitution-ring,nottheonion,"A retired San Diego vice squad officer has been indicted for running a prostitution ring out of a handful of massage parlors in California and Arizona, and laundering the profits.

A former police officer was indicted for allegedly owning illicit massage parlors. (Photo: City Walkr, Flickr, License)Peter Griffin, 78, had previously worked with a police unit “tasked with dismantling the very businesses he now stands charged with operating and promoting,” the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) said in a statement on Friday.

Along with three others, Griffin is facing charges including conspiracy, fraud, money laundering, and racketeering.

According to the DOJ, Griffin and his co-conspirators owned and managed five massage parlors between 2013 and August 2022, which clandestinely provided sexual services to clients for cash. Griffin and two other suspects were arrested in San Diego last week and taken into federal custody; a fourth remains at large.

Authorities say the group employed a sophisticated system to run the operation, “using cell phones, the internet, and banking channels to register their businesses, (and) advertise commercial sexual services online.” They allegedly used several bank accounts to launder the proceeds.

The DOJ noted that “an indictment is merely an allegation, and the defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty.”

The DOJ added in its statement that its Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit was helping to prosecute the case. But a spokesperson declined to answer emailed questions about whether Griffin and his alleged co-conspirators are accused of being involved in human trafficking.

Adam Sharki, a San Diego police spokesperson, said Griffin had retired from the force almost two decades ago. He declined to comment on whether the investigation was focused on human trafficking, but added: “As a member of the San Diego Human Trafficking Task Force, the San Diego Police Department assisted in this investigation.”

There are more than 9,000 illicit massage parlors across the U.S., according to a report by the Polaris Project, a Washington DC-based anti-trafficking organization.

“There may be women who choose to sell sex either along with or under the guise of massage therapy, but evidence suggests that behind these bland facades, many of the thousands of women engaging in commercial sex in illicit massage parlors are victims of human trafficking,” the report said.

Illicit massage parlors generate around US$2.5 billion per year, according to Polaris. But corporate secrecy laws mean law enforcement agencies have a hard time identifying the people behind the businesses, which can be owned by shell companies that do not list the owners.

In many cases, owners also operate other cash businesses such as nail salons and dry cleaners, and the illicit profits from massage parlors are filtered through their books, according to Polaris.

Griffin and his alleged co-conspirators face a potential maximum sentence of 45 years each, in addition to financial penalties as high as $2.5 million."
"6 days after getting out of prison for punching a woman and kicking a cop in the groin, Chicago man allegedly punched another woman and kicked another cop in the groin",https://cwbchicago.com/2022/10/6-days-after-getting-out-of-prison-for-punching-a-woman-and-kicking-a-chicago-cop-in-the-groin-he-allegedly-punched-another-woman-and-kicked-another-chicago-cop-in-the-groin.html,nottheonion,"James Killingsworth | CPD

Six days after getting out of prison for punching a woman in the face during a robbery attempt downtown — and kicking a Chicago cop in the groin — James Killingsworth on Tuesday allegedly punched a woman in the face on the CTA and kicked another Chicago cop in the groin. But the Illinois Department of Corrections is not revoking his parole.

You may remember Killingsworth from two stories we published about him a couple of years ago.

Chicago police arrested him a few days before Christmas 2020 after he stole a woman’s phone from her hand as she walked in the 1000 block of North State. A witness tripped Killingsworth as he ran from the scene, and a police sergeant who happened to be in the area took him into custody.

“When I get out of these handcuffs,” Killingsworth allegedly told an officer at the scene, “I’m going to beat your b*tch ass.”

Killingsworth then kicked the cop in the groin, prosecutors said.

Investigators later linked Killingsworth to another attack that occurred in Streeterville two days earlier.

In that case, a woman was walking in the 400 block of East Ontario when Killingsworth ran up, punched her in the face, and tried to take her phone around 3:15 p.m. on December 17, 2020.

Last month, a judge sentenced Killingsworth to four concurrent three-year prison sentences for aggravated battery of a peace officer, theft, attempted robbery, and aggravated battery in a public place.

He arrived at Stateville Correctional Center last Wednesday, October 19. After receiving credits for time spent in jail and the state’s standard 50% sentence reduction, he went home the same day, according to IDOC records.

Six days later, on October 25, Killingsworth punched a woman in the face at the 87th Street CTA station, prosecutors said. The woman was taken to a hospital for treatment but did not have visible injuries.

Killingsworth threatened to beat up Chicago police officers who took him to the station and then kicked one of them in the groin, prosecutors alleged.

He is charged with felony aggravated battery of a peace officer and misdemeanor battery.

Judge Maryam Ahmad sighed when the prosecutor told her that IDOC was not lodging a parole hold against Killingsworth.

The judge then ordered him to pay a $12,000 bail deposit to go home on electronic monitoring."

A Gladstone man, who recently spoke in support of banning books from North Kansas City School District libraries that depicted sexual acts, is facing a felony charge of second-degree child molestation and a misdemeanor charge of fourth-degree domestic assault. Ryan Utterback, 29, is also facing a misdemeanor charge of furnishing pornographic material or attempting to furnish to a minor in a separate case.Utterback did not answer questions about the charges from KMBC 9 Investigates on Thursday as he showed up to the Clay County Courthouse for a hearing. Utterback's attorney, David Bell, declined to comment about the charges.In the first case, a probable cause statement alleges Utterback laid down on a bed with a child less than 12 and fondled the child in December of 2020. The child told investigators Utterback placed the child on his lap, where he proceeded to move the child’s body against his while touching the child’s thighs, according to the probable cause statement. In the same case, but in a separate incident in September of 2020, Utterback stuck his finger through a ripped hole in a teenager’s jeans and started rubbing on the teenager’s leg, according to the probable cause statement. The teenager told investigators it felt uncomfortable, and that the teenager “didn't like it at all,” the probable cause statement said.A separate case alleges Utterback started showing videos sexual in nature on his cellphone to a young child around the time the child was 4 years old, according to a probable cause statement.KMBC 9 Investigates started looking into Utterback's case after sources told KMBC he spoke in November against books in North Kansas City school libraries showing sexual acts.School board members that evening listened to students who spoke in favor of not banning books from libraries.""You know, I definitely understand their struggles.

30 animals found dead in animal rescue CEO's home,https://fox8.com/news/30-animals-found-dead-in-animal-rescue-ceos-sc-home/,nottheonion,"This is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.

WARNING: Details of this story are graphic and may disturb some people.

COLUMBIA, S.C. (WSPA) – An animal rescue director in Columbia, South Carolina, is accused of 30 counts of ill-treatment of animals. On Friday, the sheriff’s department in Richland County arrested Carolina Dawn Pennington, 47, after they say she turned herself in.

Pennington is the CEO and director of a non-profit animal rescue called GROWL.

On May 22, deputies say they received a call reporting a “smell of death” was coming from a home in Columbia. Once they arrived, deputies confirmed the smell and entered the residence – where they say they found a disturbing and extreme case of animal cruelty.

Thirty dead animals – 28 dogs and two cats – were found in cages and crates, according to the sheriff’s office. The animals had been dead for long amounts of time and looked to have died from starvation and dehydration. The animals were lying in their own waste and the sheriff’s office believes they died in the cages and had not been moved before being discovered by deputies.

Deputies said at the time of the incident, Pennington was employed by the Kershaw County Humane Society, in addition to operating GROWL.

GROWL is a registered 501(c)3 non-profit organization. Investigators said to contact RCSD if you have made documented donations to GROWL in the last year.

Richland County Animal Control worked with RCSD to remove the animals from the home.

Pennington was booked into the Alvin S. Glenn Detention Center."

Cops fired for ignoring robbery to catch Snorlax in Pokemon Go denied court review,https://www.dexerto.com/pokemon/cops-fired-for-ignoring-robbery-to-catch-snorlax-in-pokemon-go-denied-court-review-1809097/,nottheonion,"A couple of Los Angeles Police Department officers have been denied a new court review after being fired for ignoring a robbery in progress to catch a Snorlax in Pokemon Go.

Earlier this year, it was reported that officers Louis Lozano and Eric Mitchell tried to catch a Snorlax in Pokemon Go despite getting a radio call that the Macy’s at Crenshaw Plaza was being robbed and cops had requested backup.

Lozano and Mitchell claimed that they never heard the request for backup because it was “loud”, resulting in their vehicle’s digital video system recording being reviewed.

According to court documents, one of the officers alerted his partner that a Snorlax “just popped up” and for 20 minutes, the two discussed Pokemon while they drove to different locations to hunt the creatures on their phones.

Pokemon Stopping a robbery is a bit more important than catching Pokemon.

Texas crisis centers remain busy despite plans to end rape,https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/texas/texas-rape-victims/285-29bfb9b3-1a95-4a72-8397-0feafebad8f3,nottheonion,"Rape crisis centers in Texas say their caseloads remain high a year after a new abortion law that made no exceptions for rape victims went into effect.

Example video title will go here for this video

TEXAS, USA — When Texas' new abortion law made no exceptions in cases of rape, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott defended it with an assurance: Texas would get to work eliminating rapes.

Editorial note: The above video is from a recent interview with Gov. Abbott

One year later, Lindsey LeBlanc is busy as ever helping rape victims in a college town outside Houston.

“The numbers have stayed consistently high,” said LeBlanc, executive director of the Sexual Assault Resource Center in Bryan, near Texas A&M University. Despite hiring two additional counselors in the past six months, she still has a waitlist for victims.

“We are struggling to keep up with demand,"" she said.

The constant caseloads in Texas are another example of how Republicans have struggled to defend zero-exception abortion bans that are unpopular in public polling, have caused uproar in high-profile cases and are inviting political risk heading into November’s midterm elections. A year since Texas' law went into effect in September 2021, at least a dozen states also have bans that make no exceptions in cases of rape or incest.

The absence of exceptions has caused divisions among Republicans, including in West Virginia, where a new law signed this month allows a brief window for rape and incest victims to obtain abortions only if they report to law enforcement first. Recently, South Carolina Republicans scuttled a proposed ban after failing to get enough GOP support.

“It really disgusts me,” said Republican South Carolina state Sen. Katrina Shealy, ripping into her male colleagues on the floor of the state Senate.

Republican U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, also of South Carolina, allowed exceptions under the proposed national abortion ban he introduced last week. The proposal has virtually no chance of passing, with even GOP leaders not immediately backing it, reflecting how Republicans have broadly struggled to navigate the issue of abortion with voters since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade this summer.

Overwhelming majorities of voters think their state should generally allow abortion in specific cases, including rape, incest or if the health of the pregnant person is endangered. Even Republicans are seeing it as a line with some voters.

“It's a very gray issue,” said Claudia Alcazar, the GOP chairwoman in Starr County along the Texas-Mexico border that has become a new political battleground after Republicans made big gains with more conservative Hispanic voters in 2020.

She said she knows those who are “hardcore, never have abortion for any reason, period. And then I have the other ones that are like, ‘Well, you know, it depends.’”

In Texas, the blowback was swift when Abbott said last September: “Texas will work tirelessly to make sure that we eliminate all rapists from the streets."" Critics called it detached from reality. A sexual assault hotline in Houston has answered almost 4,800 calls through August this year — putting it on track to exceed last year’s volume of 4,843.

As of this summer, all abortions were banned in Texas except if it would save a mother’s life.

Asked what Abbott has done in the past year to eliminate rape, spokeswoman Renae Eze highlighted older measures to clear rape test kit backlogs, a law signed in June aimed at coordinating and expanding sexual assault resources and a task force his office launched in 2019 to address the issue.

“To prevent such heinous crimes before they happen, and to prosecute any criminals to the full extent of the law, Governor Abbott has aggressively fought against defunding the police and led bail reform efforts to prevent the release of dangerous criminals,” Eze said in a statement.

More than 14,000 rape crimes have been reported in Texas since the law took effect last year, according to data from the Texas Department of Public Safety. That was slightly down from the year before and consistent with a decline in other violent crime figures across the state.

Crisis centers in Texas say the number of rape victims they’ve accompanied to hospitals for exams is rebounding since the pandemic restrictions kept advocates from entering. The Women’s Center in Fort Worth has made more than 650 visits to counsel victims undergoing exams in the past year compared to about 340 in the year prior, said Alisha Mathenia, the assistant director of crisis services at the center.

The majority of sexual assaults are never reported to police, making any available data an incomplete picture. And about 8 out of 10 sexual assaults are committed by a person known to the victim, according to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network.

“We’re not talking about a large number of rapists walking around on the street. That’s a myth,” said Democrat Donna Howard, a state representative in Austin who co-authored the bill creating Abbott's task force."

Queen lookalike to retire after 34 years out of respect for late monarch,https://www.mylondon.news/lifestyle/queen-lookalike-retire-after-34-24985076,nottheonion,"A Queen Elizabeth II lookalike has said she is retiring from her job after 34 years of impersonating the monarch ""out of respect"" following the Queen's death aged 96 on Thursday (September 8). Mary Reynolds, 89, from Epping, says she will still keep her regal outfits in memory of the monarch who to her ""felt like part of the family.""

After being told she looked like the Queen from as young as 17, back when she was just Princess Elizabeth, Mary first became a professional lookalike back in 1988. During her three decades of work as a lookalike she's also appeared both on the big and small screen in character, including alongside the late Sir Roger Moore in the 1990 comedy Bullseye and in an episode of Doctor Who in 1988.

Mary told the PA news agency she felt “lucky” to look like the Queen, but that her days as a doppelganger have now come to an end. “It’s been a great privilege to look like her because I think she’s so incredible,” she said.

“I mean, it’s a change of an era now, it’s all going to be very weird. I was watching the television the day before and felt that there was going to be some bad news, which of course eventually came and it makes you feel very, very, very sad. And then you do sort of realise that will be the end as far as I’m concerned… out of respect, I don’t think one should do anything.""

Mary said she had been approached by a Russian television company after the Queen’s death on Thursday asking her to don her impersonator outfit. “There was something about a Russian television company wanting to do something with me and they wanted to see me dressed up and I said, the only way I would dress up as the Queen would be in a black dress,” she said.

The decision to leave her role as a lookalike wasn't an easy one though and has made Mary “very sad”.

""I’ve just moved home… and I’ve got two boxes full of hats and I’ve just found somewhere to put them and I thought: I’m not really going to need them any more, it makes you feel very sad.” she continued.

She added that she will probably keep her outfits of the Queen though as “they’ve been part of my life for so long” and said that she had two separate wardrobes for her normal and royal outfits, but would dip into “the Queen’s” closet if she was going “somewhere special”.

Recalling moments from her career, Ms Reynolds noted the excitement some members of the public would experience when they saw her. “We went to Uganda for British Airways and Sheraton Hotels and they had a racing event on the shores of Lake Victoria,” she said.

“I was just walking around and an African woman dressed up in her robes was going ‘ooh’ every time she saw me because I was ‘the Queen’.”

In another moment she remembered having to be rescued while filming for an Indian movie in Greenwich, London, because “there were so many people wanting pictures”.

Despite never meeting the Queen, Ms Reynolds said that she was present at several of her most important milestones. “I was in the Mall when she got married and I was just off of the Mall for her coronation,” she said.

“I slept overnight in the road with my boyfriend, in tents. We got very wet and we got very lucky because one of the buildings there had a radio so we actually heard the whole of the service and as they put the crown on her head, the heavens opened.”

Ms Reynolds added that she always tried to “act like the Queen and to be nice to and respect people. She was a person who was so much light and she was a very well-loved person and friends with everybody, she just felt like part of the family, almost.

“I’ve had all these years of doing the work and it has helped me earn some money, but at the same time it was a pleasure for people to see you and say: ‘It’s the Queen.’ Wherever you went in the world, it was the Queen – not Queen Elizabeth, not the Queen of England, it was the Queen. There will never be anyone like her.”

Texas teacher on administrative leave after telling students to call pedophiles 'minor attracted persons',https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/texas-teacher-administrative-leave-telling-students-call-pedophiles-mi-rcna47064,nottheonion,"A teacher in El Paso, Texas, is on administrative leave and facing termination after she told students to call pedophiles ""minor attracted persons"" in an incident that was captured on video and shared on social media, according to the city's school district.

In an 18-second clip, the Franklin High School teacher can be heard telling students to ""stop calling them that. You're not allowed to label people like that.""

""We're not gonna call them that,"" the teacher is heard saying in the video. ""We're gonna call them MAPs, minor attracted persons. So don't judge people just because they wanna have sex with a 5-year-old.""

The teacher was identified by the El Paso Teachers Association as Amber Parker, who teaches English at Franklin High School.

NBC News reached out to Parker, who said she's ""not legally allowed to comment at this time.""

Requests for comment from Franklin High School were not immediately returned.

It’s unclear what happened prior to the 18-second video, or what the context of the exchange was. The El Paso Independent School District declined to answer questions on what led to the classroom discussion.

The school district was made aware of the incident early last week and promptly launched an investigation, spokesperson Liza Rodriguez said Friday.

""After a thorough investigation was conducted, on September 6, 2022, during a Special Board Meeting, the Board of Trustees approved a decision to notify a Franklin High School teacher of proposed termination,"" she said. ""Any allegation of potential misconduct is investigated thoroughly, and the safety of our students is a top priority.""

The school district would not disclose the findings of its investigation or any other information, saying the incident is a “personnel matter.”

The Board of trustees voted unanimously to initiate termination procedures against the teacher, with the next step being ""an appeals process governed by the Texas Education Code,"" Al Velarde, president of the board, said. The teacher is now on paid administrative leave pending termination, according to Rodriguez.

Prior to the vote on Tuesday, the board’s Vice President Daniel Call said the classroom exchange was taken out of context.

However, Call said he had a change of heart after being briefed on the school district's findings following their investigation on Tuesday.

""Initially I was shocked and horrified when I saw the video,"" he told NBC News. ""Then when I heard that she was trying to be sarcastic, I felt bad for her. However, when the district's investigation into this situation helped me understand the full story, I have no doubt that terminating this teacher is the right thing to do. Any reasonable person that heard the results of the investigation would vote to terminate her.""

Call wouldn't share the details of the investigation that led to him changing his mind on the incident.

El Paso Teachers Association President Norma De La Rosa said she was advised by the union's legal staff not to comment on the incident at this time.

""I will be more than happy to comment once the teacher has had an opportunity to appeal and that process is complete,"" she told NBC News. ""I am certain that by then I will have plenty to comment on."""
"Texas bans 10 banks, 348 investment funds over fossil fuel policies",https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/texas-bans-10-banks-348-investment-funds-over-fossil-fuel-policies-71842914,nottheonion,"Texas is banning 10 large banks and 348 investment funds for allegedly boycotting fossil fuel-based energy companies critical to the state's economy, a move critics said could cost taxpayers in the Lone Star State hundreds of millions annually in higher interest costs.

The state's blacklist released Aug. 24 follows West Virginia's decision in July to ban five banks for the same reason. Such actions come as some Republican-led states are cracking down on corporate social and environmental policies the states perceive to be politically driven.

Banks that Texas put on notice earlier this year went to great lengths to show that they are, in fact, investing tens of millions in the fossil fuel industry, but some failed to convince the state. Texas and West Virginia have now banned BlackRock Inc., the world's largest asset manager, from doing business with the state.

Texas' exclusion list of so-called Annex I companies also includes BNP Paribas SA, Credit Suisse AG, Danske Bank A/S, Jupiter Fund Management PLC, Nordea Bank Abp, Schroders PLC, Svenska Handelsbanken AB (publ), Swedbank AB (publ) and UBS Group AG. The 348 investment funds belong to banks in the U.S. and Europe.

Large pension funds such as the Teacher Retirement System of Texas will now be required to divest from companies and funds on the list, as will a multibillion-dollar public school fund.

""A vibrant Texas oil and gas industry is a stabilizing force in today's economic and geopolitical environment,"" Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar said in a statement. ""My greatest concern is the false narrative that has been created by the environmental crusaders in Washington, D.C., and Wall Street that our economy can completely transition away from fossil fuels, when, in fact, they will be part of our everyday life into the foreseeable future.""

The Texas crackdown came on the heels of Florida's Aug. 23 decision to bar the state's $186 billion pension fund from considering environmental, social or governance factors in investment decisions. Other Republican-led states are expected to follow suit.

Loan costs soared

Steve Rothstein, managing director of the Ceres Accelerator for Sustainable Capital Markets, said such state efforts are escalating in part because of the groundswell of investors demanding change. For example, in 2021 ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland, investors managing $52 trillion in assets urged nations to phase out coal, and many institutional investors have pledged to gradually reduce their carbon footprints.

""The market is speaking, and there are some states that want to put their thumb on the market,"" Rothstein said in an interview. ""Texas taxpayers, unfortunately, will have a burden of hundreds of billions of dollars based on this decision.""

A July study from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School estimated that municipalities and other public entities in Texas paid between $303 million and $532 million more in interest on the $32 billion they borrowed during the first eight months after the anti-ESG laws Texas enacted in 2021 took effect and some large banks had to cease bond underwriting.

"Two arrested in Louisiana for illegally transporting house, abandoning it on road",https://cdllife.com/2022/two-arrested-in-louisiana-for-illegally-transporting-house/,nottheonion,"Police in Iberia Parish, Louisiana, recently arrested two men in connection with an illegal heavy haul that resulted in property damage and a power outage.

At 3:30 a.m on May 22, the Iberia Parish Sheriff’s Office (IPSO) responded to Berard Road in Loreauville for a report of an illegal transport of a house.

When officers arrived on scene, they found an abandoned truck, trailer and house blocking the 400 block of Berard Road.

“This has been an ongoing situation and the owner of the house, Tony Domingue (male, 46 years old) was instructed and warned by Sheriff Office Officials that proper permits needed to be acquired from Iberia Parish Government. Those instructions were ignored and during the move down Coteau Holmes Road many mailboxes, road signs and trees were damaged in the process. As well as, hitting power lines and polls causing 695 CLECO customers to be without power for several hours,” IPSO said.

Assistant principal fired after reading children’s book to class,https://www.wbrc.com/2022/03/09/assistant-principal-fired-after-reading-childrens-book-class/?fbclid=IwAR3OYgiC36f28k9qbwARcuSMeFkwWUnpQMpGWmSecaDWR7JznWCVhXMZsw8,nottheonion,"JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT/Gray News) – An assistant principal in Mississippi was fired last week after reading the children’s book “I Need a New Butt!” to a class of second-grade students.

“My boss had asked me to set up a Zoom with the second-grade classes and the principal at the school they’re going to be at next year, and she was going to read to them. And she didn’t show,” Assistant Principal Toby Price told WLBT.

To improvise, Price said his boss told him to read to the students instead.

“I grabbed one of my favorite books that I had nearby, I read it to them. It’s a funny, silly book,” Price explained.

Price said he had read this book at previous school districts before and never heard any pushback or complaints.

“I didn’t think twice about reading it, because I’ve never had an issue with it before. There are other books that have much more suggestive material that are much more widely accepted,” Price said.

According to Price’s termination letter from the superintendent of the Hinds County School District, Price showed “a lack of professionalism and impaired judgment” by picking the book.

“I just think that, you know, this was a pretty harsh reaction. I’ve been in education for 20 years. I’ve never had a disciplinary anything put in my file, not even for being late. So, I was blown away,” Price said.

In response to Price’s situation, children’s book authors, teachers and librarians have messaged and posted on social media stating the book is “hilarious and sweet,” “joyful and fun” and “lighthearted” and that the superintendent’s decision was wrong.

Now, Price is hoping to overturn their decision, get his job back and teach others that funny books are needed in education.

The superintendent in the school district declined to comment about Price’s firing.

Food Drive Canceled After Catalytic Converters Stolen From Mobile Food Shelves,https://www.fox9.com/news/catalytic-converters-stolen-from-st-paul-nonprofits-mobile-food-shelf-vehicles,nottheonion,"article

A nonprofit in St. Paul that brings food to people is taking a huge hit after a theft from its vehicles over the weekend.

Keystone Community Services announced the catalytic converters were stolen from both of its Foodmobile vehicles, which are food shelves on wheels.

Keystone had to cancel all of its mobile distribution events this week at least, maybe longer depending on the supply chain to get these parts. President and CEO Mary McKeown said the cancellations mean more than 103 families, at least 230 people, won't be able to get food through Keystone’s mobile food service this week.

McKeown said the theft couldn't come at a worse time.

""Food costs have gone up, gas prices have gone up. And so we have more new people coming to our food shelves now than we ever have. So this is a terrible time to not be able to be bringing this important, vital basic need to people in the communities,"" she said.

Each month, Keystone brings the vehicles to 30 spots around St. Paul and Ramsey County, including senior housing and sites for people with disabilities. The nonprofit has had a mobile food program since 2015.

""We started it because we realized a lot of people can't get to our food shops that are on Rice Street and on University Avenue in St. Paul, and so we wanted to make sure that we could give food to people in the easiest way possible,"" McKeown said.

On Monday morning, a staff member discovered someone had stolen the catalytic converters off both Foodmobile vehicles over the weekend.

Keystone partners with another nonprofit, Midwest Special Services, Inc., and the vehicles were both parked behind locked gates at MSS’ facility. MSS is a nonprofit that provides services for people with disabilities in the Twin Cities, and catalytic converters were also stolen from MSS vehicles.

McKeown said it will cost at least $2,500 to replace the part on the smaller Foodmobile vehicle and even more for the larger vehicle.

""We have such a generous and supportive community that I know we'll get through this, but it's avoidable. It wasn't like somebody had a car accident. This is someone that purposely went and uninstalled these catalytic converters off the two vehicles that they know bring food out to the community. So just stop, stop doing it,"" she said.

McKeown also had this message for the person or people who stole the parts off the vehicles: ""I don't know their story. I wish they would stop stealing. I wish they would find other ways to support themselves. We would certainly welcome them at a Keystone food shelf if they don't have enough resources in order to support their family.""

Community members who are looking for ways to help can make a monetary donation to Keystone to help cover the cost of the catalytic converters. McKeown also encouraged everyone to donate to their local food shelves because they need help now more than ever. She expects more people to visit Keystone’s food shelves now that they canceled the mobile distribution events.

Here is a list of Keystone’s most needed items:

Culturally-specific items: rice, chili paste, masa flour, soy sauce, vermicelli noodles, fish sauce

Rhode Island Cop Charged With Assault After Punching Female Senate Rival During Abortion Rally,https://www.blackenterprise.com/rhode-island-cop-charged-with-assault-after-punching-female-senate-rival-during-abortion-rally/,nottheonion,"An off-duty Providence police offer and GOP Senate candidate has been charged with simple assault and disorderly conduct after allegedly punching his opponent, a Black woman, during an abortion rights rally outside the Rhode Island State House Friday night.

Jeann Lugo, 35, has been suspended with pay from his job at the Providence Police Department, after the alleged assault against Democratic nominee Jennifer Rourke, 40, reports the Associated Press.

“I’m a reproductive rights organizer & State Senate candidate,” Rourke wrote on Twitter with the video of the attack. “Last night, after speaking at our Roe rally, my Republican opponent — a police officer — violently attacked me. This is what it is to be a Black woman running for office. I won’t give up.”

In a statement released on Saturday, the police department did not name Lugo, but said, “The officer has served on the department for three years and was placed on administrative leave with pay this morning, pending a criminal investigation and administrative review.” The arrest forced Lugo to end his campaign for the state Senate seat in Warwick.

According to the Boston Globe, Lugo commented that he “stepped in to protect someone that a group of agitators was attacking,” although will not deny the punching claims.

Rourke contends that she was trying to escort a counterprotester away from the rally after they agreed to leave. At that same moment, another altercation occurred and she fell victim to multiple punches in the face. She confirmed to AP that she has pressed charges.

“I’m disappointed he chose to use violence in this way. As a police officer, he’s trained to deescalate,” she said. “He did not do what he was trained to do.”

Additionally, she mentioned that she had never interacted with Lugo nor did she know her opponent would be in attendance at the pro-aboriton rally.

Two others were arrested and charged that night following the violent turn of events.

Lugo is scheduled to be due in court for an arraignment on July 8."

Brad Pitt explained why he chose to wear a skirt to the Berlin premiere of his new movie ""Bullet Train"" in July.

""I don't know! We're all going to die, so let's mess it up,"" Pitt told Variety's Marc Malkin in an interview at the film's Los Angeles premiere on Monday, where he wore a Kelly green leisure suit, teal long-sleeved top, and mustard and oxblood sneakers,

At the earlier premiere in Germany, the Oscar-winning movie star made headlines after pairing a brown skirt with a matching brown blazer and a rumpled mauve button-down shirt. He accessorized that outfit with brown sunglasses, black combat boots, and rows of chains anchored by chunky medallions.

Pitt is far from the only male celebrity to move beyond conventional gender norms in fashion.

Gender nonconforming fashion has been standard in the LGBTQ community for generations, but it has been going mainstream in recent years and has become more normalized on red carpets and at events. Celebrities like Jared Leto, Kid Cudi, and Harry Styles have all been part of bringing gender-free fashion to the forefront of pop culture.

Pitt himself has expressed interest in gender-free fashion in the past. He wore a series of dresses for a 1999 Rolling Stone cover shoot. In 2004, Pitt told British Vogue that ""men will be wearing skirts by next summer"" in an interview about his film ""Troy."" In the movie, adapted from the classic Greek epic poem ""The Iliad,"" Pitt played Achilles and wore a leather skirt.

""That's my prediction and proclamation. The film answers to both genders. We were going for realism and Greeks wore skirts all the time then,"" he added.

More recently, he told Esquire in a 2021 interview that ""comfort"" was his first priority when selecting clothing and that he found chasing fashion trends ""exhausting.""

Man arrested after pointing gun at people who didn’t thank him for holding door,https://www.wtnh.com/news/crime-news/man-arrested-after-pointing-gun-at-people-who-didnt-thank-him-for-holding-door/,nottheonion,
Mars probe running Windows 98 receives software update after two decades,https://www.techradar.com/news/mars-probe-running-windows-98-receives-software-update-after-two-decades,nottheonion,"Patch management for the latest versions of Windows might the concern of most of us located here on Earth, but meanwhile, the European Space Agency’s (ESA) Mars Express spacecraft has received the first major update to its software in 19 years.

The probe first began orbiting Mars in 2003. Its current mission: to discover of signs of liquid water on Mars, including a suspected 20 x 30km lake of salty water buried under 1.5 km of ice in the red planet’s southern polar region.

The updates to the software, originally developed in Windows 98, were conducted by engineers from the Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica (INAF), Italy, and were fully funded by the Italian Space Agency (ASI).

What does this mean?

The agency said the upgrade will enable the spacecraft to view Mars and its moon Phobos with better levels of detail.

The Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionospheric Sounding (MARSIS) instrument on Mars Express sends low-frequency radio waves down towards the planet using its 40-metre long antenna.

Most of these waves are reflected from the planet’s surface, but significant amounts travel through the crust and are reflected at boundaries between layers of different materials below the surface, including ice, soil, rock, and water.

By examining the reflected signals, scientists can map the structure below the surface of Mars to a depth of a few kilometres and study properties such as the thickness and composition of its polar ice caps and the properties of volcanic and sedimentary rock layers.

“Previously, to study the most important features on Mars, and to study its moon Phobos at all, we relied on a complex technique that stored a lot of high-resolution data and filled up the instrument’s on-board memory very quickly,” said Andrea Cicchetti, the MARSIS deputy principal investigator and operation manager at INAF.

He added: “By discarding data that we don’t need, the new software allows us to switch MARSIS on for five times as long and explore a much larger area with each pass.”

Correction (July 02):

This article has been updated to reflect the fact the Mars Express probe does not itself run on Windows 98, but rather software developed using Windows 98, and to clarify its purpose."
"Amid record inflation, 36% of employees earning $100,000 or more say they are living paycheck to paycheck",https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/16/more-high-earners-are-living-paycheck-to-paycheck.html,nottheonion,"More than a third of high-earning American workers feel strapped for cash — a share that has risen dramatically in recent years.

Thirty-six percent of U.S. employees with salaries of $100,000 or more are living paycheck to paycheck — twice as many who said they were in 2019, according to a survey conducted by Willis Towers Watson, a consulting firm.

That's more than the 34% of workers who earn $50,000 to $100,000 a year who are living paycheck to paycheck, though lower than the 52% of paycheck-to-paycheck workers with incomes of less than $50,000, according to the survey.

However, the high earners are the only group that saw an increase in their paycheck-to-paycheck ranks in the last three years.

Wade Quotes Infamous Witch Trial Judge With Long-Discredited Ideas on Rape Justice Alito’s leaked opinion cites Sir Matthew Hale, a 17th-century jurist who conceived the notion that husbands can’t be prosecuted for raping their wives, who sentenced women to death as “witches,” and whose misogyny stood out even in his time.

When U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, in a draft opinion obtained and published this week by Politico, detailed his justifications for overturning Roe v. Wade, he invoked a surprising name given the case’s subject. In writing about abortion, a matter inextricably tied to a woman’s control over her body, Alito chose to quote from Sir Matthew Hale, a 17th-century English jurist whose writings and reasonings have caused enduring damage to women for hundreds of years.

The so-called marital rape exemption — the legal notion that a married woman cannot be raped by her husband — traces to Hale. So does a long-used instruction to jurors to be skeptical of reports of rape. So, in a way, do the infamous Salem witch trials, in which women (and some men) were hanged on or near Gallows Hill.

Hale’s influence in the United States has been on the wane since the 1970s, with one state after another abandoning his legal principles on rape. But Alito’s opinion resurrects Hale, a judge who was considered misogynistic even by his era’s notably low standards. Hale once wrote a long letter to his grandchildren, dispensing life advice, in which he veered into a screed against women, describing them as “chargeable unprofitable people” who “know the ready way to consume an estate, and to ruin a family quickly.” Hale particularly despaired of the changes he saw in young women, writing, “And now the world is altered: young gentlewomen learn to be bold” and “talk loud.”

An excerpt from Hale’s “Letter of Advice.” Credit: Via Google Books

Hale became Lord Chief Justice of England in 1671. In his time (Hale’s contemporaries included Oliver Cromwell and Charles II), Hale was a respected, perhaps even venerated, jurist known for piety and sober judgment. He wrote a two-volume legal treatise, “The History of the Pleas of the Crown,” that has proved influential ever since.

Alito, in his draft opinion, invokes “eminent common-law authorities,” including Hale, to show how abortion was viewed historically not as a right, but as a criminal act. “Two treatises by Sir Matthew Hale likewise described abortion of a quick child who died in the womb as a ‘great crime’ and a ‘great misprision,’” Alito wrote.

Even before “quickening” — defined by Alito as “the first felt movement of the fetus in the womb, which usually occurs between the 16th and 18th week of pregnancy” — Hale believed an abortion could qualify as homicide. “Hale wrote that if a physician gave a woman ‘with child’ a ‘potion’ to cause an abortion, and the woman died, it was ‘murder’ because the potion was given ‘unlawfully to destroy her child within her,’” Alito wrote.

Courts have long leaned on precedents established by old cases and the scholarship of legal authorities from centuries gone by. But what happens when you trace citations back to their ancient source? In Hale’s case, you sometimes find a man conceiving precepts out of thin air. Other times it was the opposite, as he clung to notions that were already becoming anachronistic in the last half of the 17th century.

Consider the marital rape exemption. In “Pleas of the Crown,” Hale wrote, “The husband cannot be guilty of a rape committed by himself upon his lawful wife for by their mutual matrimonial consent and contract the wife hath given up herself in this kind unto her husband which she cannot retract.” So, according to Hale, marriage, for a woman, amounts to contractual forfeit, in which she loses legal protection or recourse should her husband sexually assault her.

Hale’s pronouncement became the accepted common law and served as foundation in the United States for immunizing a husband accused of raping his wife. And where did Hale’s pronouncement come from? What did he base it upon? Who knows? “Hale appears to have been the first to articulate what later would become an accepted legal principle, that a husband cannot be charged with raping his wife,” according to a footnote in one law review article. Another law review article, titled “The Marital Rape Exemption: Evolution to Extinction,” called Hale’s pronouncement “an unsupported, extrajudicial statement” lacking in authority.

Starting in the 1970s, states began to abandon the marital rape exemption, in whole or in part. In 1981, the Supreme Court of New Jersey wrote that it could find no support for Hale’s proposition among earlier writers. Hale’s declaration, the court found, “cannot itself be considered a definitive and binding statement of the common law, although legal commentators have often restated the rule since the time of Hale without evaluating its merits.” In 1984, the Supreme Court of Virginia wrote: “Hale's statement was not law, common or otherwise. At best it was Hale's pronouncement of what he observed to be a custom in 17th century England.” The Virginia court went on to note, “Moreover, Hale cites no authority for his view nor was it subsequently adopted, in its entirety, by the English courts.”

Like the marital rape exemption, the so-called Hale Warning to jurors caused centuries of misfortune in the American courts.

In “Pleas of the Crown,” Hale called rape a “most detestable crime.” Then, in words quoted many times since, he wrote, “It must be remembered, that it is an accusation easy to be made and hard to be proved, and harder to be defended by the party accused, tho never so innocent.”

Hale evoked the fear of the false accuser — and made for that fear a legal frame, which lasted for more than 300 years. In weighing the evidence in cases of alleged rape, jurors (all men, in Hale’s time and for long after) needed to consider a series of factors, Hale wrote. Did the woman cry out? Did she try to flee? Was she of “good fame” or “evil fame”? Was she supported by others? Did she make immediate complaint afterward?

Hale’s words and formulation became a standard feature of criminal trials in the United States, with jurors instructed by judges to be especially wary of allegations of rape. The effect was predictable: Charges of rape were frequently rejected. In the United States, one early example was chronicled by historian John Wood Sweet in his soon-to-be-published book, “The Sewing Girl’s Tale.” (I was allowed to read an advance copy.)

In 1793, in New York City, an aristocrat, Henry Bedlow, was accused of raping a 17-year-old seamstress, Lanah Sawyer. Bedlow hired six lawyers, including a future U.S. Supreme Court justice, who used Hale’s framework to destroy Sawyer. Sawyer said she screamed. But, one attorney asked the jury, did she also stamp her feet? Witnesses spoke of Sawyer’s good fame, according to the trial record. But “she may have had the art to carry a fair outside, while all was foul within,” the same attorney argued. “Ultimately, the defense team’s dizzying effort to dispute and distort reality had been part of a relentless effort to transform a young woman who mattered into one who didn’t,” Sweet wrote. The jury took 15 minutes to acquit.

Starting in the 1970s and 1980s, courts in the United States began moving away from instructing juries with Hale’s admonition to be particularly skeptical of rape claims. The repudiation of Hale became so complete that when a Maryland lawmaker, in 2007, invoked Hale’s words in a state legislative hearing, it was met with “outrage,” according to the Washington Post.

Despite those legal changes, the fear of the false rape accuser still persists in the justice system, at times leading to horrendous outcomes. I began researching Hale when writing, with T. Christian Miller, “An Unbelievable Story of Rape,” published by ProPublica and the Marshall Project. The story reconstructs what happened when a young woman in Lynnwood, Washington, reported being raped. We later expanded the story into a book, “Unbelievable,” in which we described Hale’s influence in rape cases at greater length. (The story also became a Netflix series.)

Then there was Hale’s role in what today is synonymous with the perversion of justice: witch trials.

In 1662, Hale presided at a jury trial in Bury St. Edmunds in which two women, Amy Denny and Rose Cullender, were accused of being witches. In a book on this case, “A Trial of Witches,” authors Ivan Bunn and Gilbert Geis wrote that by 1662, “belief in witches was in retreat in England.” Hale, however, was not part of that retreat. He believed witches were real. “Hale represented not a mainstream position but rather one rapidly becoming anachronistic,” Bunn and Geis wrote.

What’s more, Hale instructed the jurors that witches were real. A written record of the trial recounts what Hale told them: “That there were such creatures as witches he made no doubt at all; for first, the scriptures had affirmed so much. Secondly, the wisdom of all nations had provided laws against such persons, which is an argument of their confidence of such a crime.”

The jury convicted Denny and Cullender, after which Hale sentenced both women to hang. (Four years before, Hale had also sentenced to death another woman convicted of being a witch.)

Hale’s influence, once again, extended beyond the immediate case and his time. Thirty years later, his handling of the trial in Bury St. Edmunds, preserved in written record, served as a model in Salem, Massachusetts, in the infamous witch trials in 1692. “Indeed, the Salem witch-hunts might not have taken place if there had not been a trial at Bury St. Edmunds: the events at Salem notoriously imitated those at Bury,” Bunn and Geis wrote.

Hale is known mostly for his legal treatises. But his views toward women are perhaps best revealed in a letter he wrote to his grandchildren, titled “Letter of Advice.” (In a twitter thread this week I said Hale’s letter was 182 pages long. I may have understated it. I’ve since found a version online that goes on for 206 pages.)

In this letter, Hale prescribes individualized counsel for three granddaughters.

Mary, he wrote, possessed great wit and spirit, and “if she can temper the latter, will make an excellent woman, and a great housewife; but if she cannot govern the greatness of her spirit, it will make her proud, imperious, and revengeful.”

Frances, he wrote, possessed great confidence: “If she be kept in some awe, especially in relation to lying and deceiving, she will make a good woman and a good housewife.”

Ann, he wrote, possessed a “soft nature.” “She must not see plays, read comedies, or love books or romances, nor hear nor learn ballads or idle songs, especially such as are wanton or concerning love-matters, for they will make too deep an impression upon her mind.”

Hale complained in his letter that young women “make it their business to paint or patch their faces, to curl their locks, and to find out the newest and costliest fashions.” And with that, he was just getting started. Hale followed with a 160-word sentence that is a marvel in its depth of disdain.

“If they rise in the morning before ten of the clock, the morning is spent between the comb, and the glass, and the box of patches; though they know not how to make provision for it themselves, they must have choice diet provided for them, and when they are ready, the next business is to come down, and sit in a rubbed parlour till dinner come in; and, after dinner, either to cards, or to the exchange, or to the play, or to Hyde Park, or to an impertinent visit; and after supper, either to a ball or to cards; and at this rate they spend their time, from one end of the year to the other; and at the same rate they spend their parent’s or husband’s money or estates in costly clothes, new fashions, chargeable entertainments: their home is their prison, and they are never at rest in it, unless they have gallants and splendid company to entertain.”

Some observers have been taken aback that Alito referenced Hale. But not everyone was surprised. Eileen Hunt, a Notre Dame political science professor who has written extensively about Mary Wollstonecraft, author of the path-breaking 1792 treatise “A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,” tweeted:

“It is a truth universally acknowledged that a conservative Supreme Court justice will cherry-pick an Enlightenment-era man as a timeless authority on reproductive rights but ignore #Wollstonecraft’s pivotal philosophical views on women, mothering, and the sexual double standard.”"
Herschel Walker blasts climate bill: ‘Don’t we have enough trees around here?’,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/3611369-herschel-walker-blasts-climate-bill-dont-we-have-enough-trees-around-here/,nottheonion,"Georgia Senate candidate Herschel Walker (R) reiterated his opposition to Democrats’ climate, health care and taxes bill over the weekend, arguing that too much of the money is “going to trees.”

“They continue to try to fool you like they are helping you out. But they’re not. They’re not helping you out because a lot of money, it’s going to trees,” Walker said, according to a clip of his remarks that was shared with The Hill.

“Don’t we have enough trees around here?” he added, in comments that were first reported by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

He instead called for spending more money on law enforcement and complained about funding for the IRS.

The legislation, which has nearly $370 billion in spending on climate and energy programs and was signed into law by President Biden last week, puts $1.5 billion toward the Urban and Community Forestry Assistance program, which plants trees in urban areas in an effort to deal with increased heat caused by climate change.

In a tweet on Tuesday, Walker doubled down on his remark.

“Yes, you heard me right…Joe Biden and @ReverendWarnock are spending $1.5 billion on ‘urban forestry’ and raising taxes on those making under $200k to pay for it. Yes, I have a problem with that,” he wrote.

But the White House has insisted that the Inflation Reduction Act does not raise taxes on Americans earning below $400,000, though some analysts have said that increased corporates taxes may be passed onto employers or investors making less than that, according to CNBC.

Experts say that planting trees can improve both climate change and health outcomes when planted in urban spaces.

“If you were to plant millions of trees, which is what many countries want to do … we’d be removing a significant amount of carbon,” said Paul Falkowski, a professor at Rutgers University in the Earth and planetary sciences and marine and coastal sciences departments.

“Urban tree planting is very, very productive in the sense that it increases the shade, it increases the flux of moisture in the local environment, which decreases the temperature,” Falkowski added.

While the Democratic legislation did include funding for that program, its marquee climate programs include tax credits for clean energy development and incentives and penalties that aim to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas industry.

Walker’s comments attracted significant attention on Twitter as the candidate faces a tight race against Sen. Rafael Warnock (D).

They’re not the first environmental remarks from Walker to spark conversation. The candidate previously claimed that “good air” from the U.S. would float over to China if the U.S. took steps to combat climate change — and that the U.S. would be stuck cleaning China’s “bad air.”

Falkowski said, however, that it doesn’t work this way.

“Many countries have a significant amount of aerosol pollution because they burn coal. The lifetimes of these aerosols is a few weeks. Once that air gets across the Pacific Ocean, if it rains, most of that air is cleaned up. Very, very little Chinese pollution makes it to the continental United States,” he said.

Andrew Yang apologizes for tweet saying Joe Rogan isn't racist because he works with Black people,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/andrew-yang-apologizes-saying-joe-rogan-isnt-racist-works-black-people-rcna15174,nottheonion,"Former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang is backtracking on his tweet defending Joe Rogan, in which he claimed Rogan isn't racist because he works with Black people.

""I don't think Joe Rogan is a racist — the man interacts with and works with black people literally all of the time,"" Yang tweeted Sunday.

Yang, who appeared on The Joe Rogan Experience in February 2019, added, ""Do I know black friends of Joe's who would swear by him? Yes I do.""

Yang's comments came one day after Rogan, who has been the center of controversy regarding Covid-19 and vaccine misinformation on his Spotify podcast, issued a public apology for his past use of racial slurs.

In a five-minute video shared on Instagram on Saturday he said, ""I never used it to be racist."" He said though he used the N-word in the past, he hasn't used it in years, calling his behavior ""the most regretful and shameful thing that I've ever had to talk about publicly.""

Yang's comments sparked swift backlash, including outrage from Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison, who tweeted, ""Dude… seriously?! You joking right Andrew? Is that now the new defining line… working with folks?!""

Yang deleted his original tweets and shared a new thread saying, ""I think we should have the capacity to forgive people — whether a podcaster or a mayor — if they mess up. Maybe it's because I mess up too.""

He said ""racism is real,"" admitting, ""I made a mistake in an earlier tweet tonight that downplayed these realities.""

He said he deleted the tweet because it was ""wrong-headed.""

""It also hurt people, which is never my intent. I'm sorry. I'm learning and appreciate those who reached out to express their feelings,"" Yang added.

The tweets are the latest event in Rogan's Spotify saga.

Rogan is one of the streaming platform's stars. Spotify signed him in 2020 to a multiyear contract reported to be worth more than $100 million, and his program reaches an estimated 11 million listeners per episode.

In a letter to company employees Sunday, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek apologized for the Rogan scandal but said he did ""not believe that silencing Joe is the answer.""

The company took down about 70 episodes of The Joe Rogan Experience over the weekend. It's unclear if Spotify removed those episodes due to his use of a racial slur, Variety reported.

Rogan's podcast has been criticized by celebrities and medical professionals alike. Stars like singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell and Neil Young have pulled their music from the platform in protest of vaccine misinformation being shared on Spotify.

Rogan defended himself last week, vowing to ""try harder"" to offer more of a balance on his podcast.

In response to the backlash, the streaming service announced it would add a content advisory to any podcast episode that discusses the coronavirus.

Rogan has also faced heat for giving a platform to people on the far right in the past. Several of those controversial episodes with far-right figures were missing from Spotify when Rogan's podcast launched on the platform, Variety reported."
Magnet fishers fined after pulling 86 rockets from Fort Stewart river,https://www.airforcetimes.com/off-duty/military-culture/2022/08/04/magnet-fishers-fined-after-pulling-86-rockets-from-fort-stewart-river/,nottheonion,"No good deed goes unpunished.

In the case of some magnet fishers who cleared 86 rockets, a tank tracer round, and .50 caliber ammo belts from a river on Fort Stewart, the toll was a number of fines from the Georgia Department of Natural Resources.

The group, led by treasure hunter Bryce Nachtwey, called the bomb squad after their magnet fishing dredged up the ammunition and 86 rockets in a Delta Airlines duffel bag, saying they were just trying to do the right thing.

The exchange played out on Nachtwey’s YouTube channel: Outdoors Weekly.

A Fort Stewart Military Police officer called to the scene noted that he had never seen something like this, and needed to check in with his command to see what next steps to take. However, upon arrival, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources’ local game warden ticketed them for magnet fishing off the Fort Stewart bridge.

“I didn’t see any signs,” said one of Nachwey’s teammates.

“You’re all gettin’ tickets, you can come to court and talk to a judge, okay?” the warden said. “The reason magnet fishing is not allowed is because of exactly what y’all got right there. You don’t know what’s going to blow up and not blow up.”

The alternative to tickets would be to go to jail, he added.

Nachtwey said that he and his team had called the DNR ahead of time, which purportedly said magnet fishing is legal as long as it’s in a “green zone.”

However, the warden stated that red (off-limit) and green (acceptable) zones don’t apply in this scenario because the group was on Fort Stewart property. Because the base is owned by the Federal Government, the Department of Natural Resources has no authority to issue such permission, though it can ticket for offenses in the area.

The warden issued three tickets each to Nachwey and his two compatriots — two $130 tickets and one $80 ticket — for magnet fishing at Fort Stewart, entering a closed area and not having Fort Stewart permits.

The trio’s federal court date is Sept. 9, 2022.

Gohmert, speaking to Newsmax in an interview on Friday, was asked to comment on the Friday indictment of Navarro by a federal grand jury after the former Trump official failed to comply with the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.

“It actually puts an exclamation point on the fact that we have a two-tiered justice system. If you’re a Republican, you can’t even lie to Congress or lie to an FBI agent or they’re coming after you. They’re gonna bury you. They’re gonna put you in the D.C. jail and terrorize and torture you and not live up to the Constitution there,” Gohmert responded.

He argued that there was a double standard to how Democrats and Republicans were being treated, pointing to the acquittal of prominent Democratic attorney Michael Sussmann, who was being investigated by special counsel John Durham, as one example.

“So [it’s] very clear. If you’re a Democrat, then you can lie. You can cheat. You can do whatever you want,” he said.

The Hill has reached out to Gohmert’s office for further comment and clarification on his remarks.

The development comes against the backdrop of Navarro’s indictment, who is facing two charges of criminal contempt of Congress after being subpoenaed by the House select committee.

The committee is interested in hearing from the former Trump official, looking to hear possible evidence regarding efforts to have the 2020 election results overturned by allies of former President Trump.

“Who are these people?” Navarro asked during his court appearance on Friday. “This is not America. I mean, I was a distinguished public servant for four years and nobody ever questioned my ethics. And they’re treating me in this fashion.”"
"Superintendent: No, EVSC doesn't provide litter boxes for students identifying as cats",https://www.courierpress.com/story/news/local/2022/09/20/evsc-addresses-rumors-of-furries-and-litter-boxes-in-local-schools/69506009007/?fbclid=IwAR09b-32zJRtciiS4bhhs3JHisvVRfnEI55an8SG3mWYTPhJhkTBLyVRIxg#l8bpyk47nckdh7xxkq,nottheonion,"EVANSVILLE − The woman at the other end of a leash held by retired teacher Ruth Baize didn't say much, other than an occasional ""meow.""

""This is Theresa, who identifies as 'Cotton Candy,'"" Baize said.

Baize and Theresa Finn addressed the Evansville Vanderburgh School Corp. Board on Monday about social media rumors that the school district is allowing students to dress and behave as animals, even providing litter boxes in bathrooms.

It's not true, EVSC officials say and they have taken to the school's social media accounts to say so.

Litter box rumors:Here's where the false claim came from, and why some believe it

""It's unfortunate that schools around the nation are needing to to waste valuable time to address such ridiculous rumors,"" said Jason Woebkenberg, EVSC spokesman.

Baize unsuccessfully ran for EVSC school board in 2020, when it was reported that she had a history of making inflammatory remarks on social media.

Social media rumors reach EVSC schools

Stories about furries in EVSC schools have been spreading on social media sites such as Facebook in recent months, fueled by rumors among concerned parents and conservative activists nationwide that school children self-identifying as animals are disrupting classrooms. At the heart of the rumors is the idea that schools allow children to identify as animals as an extension of not discriminating against students because of their sexuality or gender identity.

Among the rumors: Not only are EVSC schools allowing students to dress and behave like animals, but also accommodate their bathroom needs.

Elections:What EVSC school board candidates say about diversity, inclusion and masks

""There are no litter boxes in our schools. Period. There never will be,"" said EVSC Superintendent David Smith, after Monday's board meeting.

Jim Baize, who is Ruth Baize's husband, compared furries to gender identity in comments of his own on Monday.

""This gender dysphoria, this animal dysphoria, that you are starting to see in your school system, by ignoring or tolerating it, not only is it going to continue but if you reward this behavior it will worsen,"" he said.

Rumors about furries have persisted despite fact-checking by news organizations that found no evidence of school children identifying as animals. The rumors have surfaced at meetings in Michigan, Texas, Iowa, Wisconsin and Nebraska, among other places. And on Monday night, the rumors surfaced at the board meeting in Evansville.

""Furries are adults who feel a deep kinship with a certain animal and dress like that animal,"" Ruth Baize said Monday.

However, not in the way that a transgender person identifies as as a different gender, according to the organization Furscience. Instead, it's more like the cosplay − which stands for costume play − phenomenon where participants dress and role play as favorite characters from comics, anime, movies and video games.

Identifying furries: What is a furry?

According to Furscience: ""The term furry describes a diverse community of fans, artists, writers, gamers, and role players. Most furries create for themselves an anthropomorphized animal character (fursona) with whom they identify and can function as an avatar within the community. Some furries wear elaborate costumes or paraphernalia such as animal ears or tails, or represent themselves as anthropomorphic animals in online communities such as Second Life.""

On Monday, Baize recited a series of second-hand reports about furries in EVSC schools but produced no actual evidence.

Local news:Evansville school board candidate: Education system 'indoctrinating' students about race

That didn't surprise board member Ann Ennis, who called Monday's public comments to the board ""most unusual.""

""The accusations are false. I have yet to hear a first-person witness account of any of these rumors,"" Ennis said. ""All of the perhaps one dozen persons I have spoken to about both of these concerns in the last eight to 10 months are working from rumor, are extremely afraid and talk a lot about parents’ rights. But they are opposed to the rights of parents who disagree with them.""

Ennis said one of the speakers Monday told her about several teachers having witnessed EVSC accommodating the behavior, but she said no one has agreed to meet with her about it.

""Monday night there was no evidence provided, just a costume stunt,"" Ennis said. ""There are no accommodations being made of animal-identifying students in the EVSC."""
Wisconsin school district bans pride flags and pronouns,https://www.weau.com/2022/08/03/wisconsin-school-district-bans-pride-flags-pronouns/,nottheonion,"MILWAUKEE (AP) - A recent decision by a Wisconsin school district to ban pride flags and the use of pronouns in emails has released an avalanche of pushback from students, alumni and others while the superintendent said it’s simply reaffirming a policy that is already in place.

Kettle Moraine School District Superintendent Ken Plum recently told the school board an interpretation of a policy that prohibits staff from using their positions to promote partisan politics, religious views and propaganda for personal, monetary or nonmonetary gain has changed following a legal analysis.

Plum said teachers and administrators are prohibited from displaying political or religious messages in their classrooms or on their person, including Pride flags, Black Lives Matter and We Back the Badge signs.

"Curse word? For one Alabama beach city, controversial coffee shop name rankles officials",https://www.al.com/news/2022/08/curse-word-for-one-alabama-beach-city-controversial-coffee-shop-name-rankles-officials.html?fbclid=IwAR2MXIpEO2c1lCuIdchsSscjq6_v0IYiA0errKfu07jlX0mq2yytFyqoI08,nottheonion,"Hawaiian donkeys have a generational reputation for being reliably strong and stubborn, earning the nickname “Bad Ass Ones.”

The hard-working donkeys also serve as the inspiration of a Colorado-based coffee chain called “Bad Ass Coffee of Hawaii.”

But one Alabama city believes the business name is vulgar and city officials are calling on residents not to patronize it once it opens its first Alabama location next month.

City officials blasted the coffee company’s name during a council meeting on Tuesday, and said it was inappropriate for children.

“If it’s not a name or a word that I don’t want to come out of my 12-year-old’s mouth, then it is not appropriate to be on a sign on one of our streets,” said Orange Beach Mayor Tony Kennon. “That’s sort of the way I see it.”

Kennon and other council members reacted to a Facebook commenter who noticed the slogan, “In God We Trust” displayed in the council chambers, and asked why the city praised “for its Christian roots” is allowing a coffee shop “with profanity clearly in the title to be on display?”

Also on display in the council chambers is a large sign that reads, “God, Family, Country.”

“It shows they have no respect for us, what we market or what our brand is,” said Kennon, referring to the city’s long push to be branded a “family-friendly” vacation destination.”

He added, “Like Coca-Cola and Pepsi, we want to market our brand. It’s what makes us special. You cannot call yourself conservative values, traditional values, and family values and be with OK with anything that goes against that.”

Kennon continued, “The council is pretty much united in our disgust. I don’t think we’re prudes by any means. But why would I drive to a place with a name such as that with an 8-year-old in the car when I wouldn’t let (that name) come out of (the child’s) mouth? We’ve become sort of crude in accepting of that kind of garbage in this country.”

‘Very Hawaiian’

Bad Ass Coffee of Hawaii is planning to open a shop in Orange Beach, Ala. But the city of Orange Beach has concerns over the venue's name. (supplied image by Bad Ass Coffee of Hawaii).

Chris Ruszkowski, senior vice-president of marketing with the Royal Ahoa Franchise Company LLC – owners of the Bad Ass Coffee of Hawaii brand – said the name is not meant to be profane, but to show “historical and cultural significance” toward the donkeys who hauled coffee produces in Hawaii.

“The supply and production of the coffee product were largely dependent on these unique domesticated, incredibly strong, and sure-footed animals,” said Ruszkowski in an email to AL.com. “The brand was appropriately named after these impressive animals that plays a crucial role in the harvesting of the coffee beans which are the source of Bad Ass Coffee of Hawaii’s premium coffees.”

He said Bad Ass Coffee of Hawaii honors the legends of the donkey in a new logo that was redesigned in 2020. He said the idea was to use the word the “Ass” (with the word, ‘Ass” referring to a biblical reference for donkey) “front and center” in the brand’s marketing.

Ruszkowski said the company goes out of its way to make sure the public isn’t confused over the name by printing the legend of the donkey on the back of every cup of coffee and beverage sold.

He admits that the name requires an explanation in every new market the coffee shop enters.

“Despite our best efforts to get out ahead in new markets to ‘tell our story’ in advance of building new stores, we often have to educate the audience on what’s behind the name,” said Ruszkowski. “Once that story has enough mass (generally accomplished through media and social) our independently owned franchise stores are welcomed and valued as contributing members of their community.”

There are 24 coffee stores currently operating in 10 states, including in several Florida Gulf Coast cities. Pensacola has one, and another is planned to open in Pensacola Beach.

Ruszkowski said the company’s name “most of the time” does not cause problems with city officials.

“There is nothing that has kept us from opening,” he said. “I think once they understand what we are all about and that we are part of the community and giving back with jobs and charitable actions, that we are a great place with a warm and welcoming Aloha spirit.”

Ruszkowski said he was not familiar with the concerns in Orange Beach.

“I will be honest,” he said. “The word ‘ass’ is disruptive, and I like that as a marketer. But we don’t play that up. I don’t look for a cheap laugh in a disruptive way. This is completely different from my neighbor who runs five miles a day being (referred to as) a ‘bad ass’ or someone going to the bar and behaving like a ‘jackass.’ We 100 percent honor the origin of the names from the donkeys. It’s very Hawaiian. We started in Hawaii and that’s where the name took on the popularity and we are bringing that to the mainland with fans who have visited us (while vacationing) in Hawaii.”

Said Ruszkowski about the Orange Beach location, “We are excited to get into the community. We hope there is not too much opposition.”

‘Regulate signage’

Orange Beach Mayor Tony Kennon speaks to the media on Wednesday, June 16, 2021. (John Sharp/jsharp@al.com).

Kennon said he understands that the coffee shop’s name is linked to donkeys, but he still does not like it.

The city of Orange Beach has a vulgarity ordinance on the books, which it enacted about a decade ago amid concerns about vulgar or indecent T-shirts and other merchandise sold at souvenir stores.

Kennon said the city will not pursue enforcement action against the coffee shop.

“They can justify it anyway they want,” he said, referring to the donkey origins of the coffee shop’s name. “That’s why we are not pursuing them legally.”

He added, “I just hope our community says that is not who we are. We understand the threat of what censorship can bring on. But at the same time, we have a right to not patronize the store if we find it offensive.”

Tim Zick, an expert on the First Amendment and a professor at the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, said the Supreme Court would allow for the city to ban “all signage in a locality for aesthetic or other content-neutral purposes,” but it does not allow censorship based on messaging.

“That sort of ban would not discriminate based on what appears on any particular sign,” said Zick, referring to a hypothetical blanket signage ban, which does not appear to be under consideration in Orange Beach.

He added, “If the signage contained obscene or other unprotected content, the city would be able to ban it. But ‘Bad Ass Coffee’ is not obscene and not otherwise unprotected speech, so the mayor has reasoned correctly that the city does not have the power to ban or regulate the signage based on its content.”

Zick said the disputes are common, and sometimes involve wine and beer labels or other business communication such as trademarks.

“The basic principle is the same: government cannot regulate based on content,” he said. “Narrower restrictions, for example, limits on where the coffee business can advertise (to protect children from seeing the language), might be upheld. But the (Supreme) Court has been skeptical of content discrimination even with respect to ‘commercial speech,’ which is the label attached to business advertisements.”

Past concerns

The coffee shop is not the only business concerning the city.

Dick’s Last Resort, which recently opened a venue at The Wharf, markets itself as putting the “F U in Fun,” according to the company’s website. The bar and restaurant are known for its intentional employment of obnoxious staff, and markets T-shirts and other merchandise with sexual innuendos. The restaurants were purchased by strip club operator, Déjà vu, in 2019.

Kennon said the city “didn’t want Dick’s here.” But he said city officials had “a long talk” with the restaurant’s staff to ensure that no one under age 18 would be allowed inside if the venue was operating with adult themes.

“They were very accommodating and so far, they have not gone in a direction that others go with the vulgarities,” said Kennon. “Dick’s is trying to conform, and we appreciate that.”

Kennon, mayor of Orange Beach since 2009, has gotten media attention in the past for offering other candid views over what he and other city officials consider a lack of morality when it comes to businesses, events or other attractions on Alabama’s beaches.

Kennon pushed for the vulgarity ordinance, telling AL.com in 2013, that he was “absolutely mortified” after spotting messages on some merchandise that was sold inside stores within the city.

“It was some of the most vulgar things I’ve ever seen and I’m not explaining that to my kid,” said Kennon, referring to T-shirts he saw displayed near cash registers at the time. The mayor said at the time that T-shirts were displayed at stores with images of obscene language and diagrams of oral sex, glorification of drug use and promiscuity, and even one labeled “Suicide Watch” with a person hanged with rope and another in a chair watching while eating popcorn.

“It’s been seven or eight years ago, and we do not have that anymore in Orange Beach. We strictly enforce that. We are a family venue, and family means kids.”

Kennon and other city officials have also weighed in on entertainment they felt was questionable. In 2015, Kennon raised concerns about the Amphitheater at The Wharf hosting a Widespread Panic concert, saying that the jam band’s Orange Beach concert in 2010 caused “chaos and destruction.”

Jeff Silvers, who served as the city’s mayor pro-tem at the time, said the city and its officials “don’t promote that style of living and floppiness” that Widespread Panic fans brings. That comment prompted Widespread Panic fans to host a “Flopper’s Ball” in Orange Beach. A number of fans did show up dressed in formal attire, but there were few police incidences that occurred during the 2015 concert.

Kennon has also been outspoken over his concerns over unruly behavior during Spring Break. He has said that Orange Beach wants to create itself as a “sanctuary city for families” and “eliminate an MTV” vibe during the annual break that attracts college students across the country.

Spring Break in Orange Beach and neighboring Gulf Shores has also been marketed as a family-friendly event. Gulf Shores, in particular, has banned alcohol on its beaches for several years during the Spring Break schedule.

“We are not prudes here, but when it comes to our kids, there are certain standards we don’t waiver from,” Kennon said."
Brazilian Woman Hospitalised with Trapped Gas as She Couldn't Fart in Front of Partner,https://www.news18.com/news/buzz/brazilian-woman-hospitalised-with-trapped-gas-as-she-couldnt-fart-in-front-of-partner-4894886.html,nottheonion,"In a bizarre incident, a Brazilian singer revealed that she landed in the hospital with trapped gas because she was embarrassed about farting in front of her boyfriend. Pocah, whose real name is Viviane de Queiroz Pereira and who is 27 years old, took to her Instagram stories to share her gas problem with her fans and followers. The story disappeared after 24 hours. As per a LADbible report, the 27-year-old dropped a handful of images of herself, in which she can be seen inside a hospital. She was following proper COVID protocols, as she was wearing a face mask. While sharing the pictures, the 27-year-old reportedly revealed how she woke up with unbearable stomach pain early in the morning and ended up in the hospital. She further assured her fans that she is fine now.

The Brazillian singer was quoted as saying by the publication, “I woke up at 5.30 am with severe stomach pains and ended up in the hospital. But that's it, guys. I'm now fine. Just an accumulation of trapped farts.”

This is not all. The singer asked all to learn through her experience and goes on to advise all her female fans to not be ashamed of farting in front of men because more embarrassing than this is being diagnosed with ‘trapped farts’. While advising the 27-year-old reportedly said, “Girls, don't be ashamed to fart in front of your guy, because what's embarrassing is not letting your guy sleep because you're in discomfort, going to the hospital with your guy, and the diagnosis being 'trapped farts'.”

Further, Pocah blamed a thread on TikTok that suggested she should ignore the stomach pains, and being influenced by the thread, she did exactly the same, which forced her to undergo several medical tests before revealing what was the actual problem.

Lettuce declared winner after it outlived Liz Truss' premiership,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/lettuce-liz-truss-uk-prime-minister-decay-resignation-british-rcna53181,nottheonion,"LONDON — Liz Truss lost to a head of lettuce.

The leafy vegetable's decay was more gradual than Truss' crumbling tenure as British prime minister, which ended with her resignation Thursday. Her decision provided an unlikely victory for the lettuce, which had been pitted against her by a tabloid newspaper last Friday.

But as she announced her resignation in brief remarks Thursday outside the prime minster's residence, more than 12,000 Twitter users were watching a live feed of the unrefrigerated iceberg, which cost around 68 cents when it was bought by The Daily Star newspaper last week and put in front of a camera next to a picture of Truss.

“Which wet lettuce will last longer?” read a caption on the feed, which was also streamed on YouTube. Many left comments, joking about the situation.

The stunt was inspired by a column in The Economist magazine titled “The Iceberg Lady,” a parody of the name given to Truss’ political idol Margaret Thatcher, who was known as ""the Iron Lady"" when she was prime minister in the 1980s. The article also described Truss as having “the shelf-life of a lettuce.”

As the days wore on, thousands of viewers tuned in and watched as a blond wig was placed on top of the vegetable, mimicking Truss’ hair.

Googly eyes were also added and the tableau was expanded to include two British flags and a red mug bearing the legend “Keep Calm and Carry On,” a slogan used to raise morale in Britain during World War II.

Other foodstuffs were added and taken away, including tofu, a joke at the expense of former interior minister Suella Braverman, who attacked “tofu-eating wokerati” as she defended new legislation designed to crack down on disruptive protests. Braverman resigned Wednesday.

After Truss's announcement Thursday, viewer numbers for the dressed-up lettuce hit 21,000 as the strains of the U.K.’s national anthem “God Save the King” rang out and the photo of Truss was flipped face-down.

“The lettuce outlasted Liz Truss,” the caption declared as a remix of “Celebration” by Kool & the Gang kicked in, lights flashed in the background and bottles of alcohol were added to the scene.

While Truss’ leadership struggles made headlines around the world, the lettuce was regularly mentioned amid the analysis and commentary on international media outlets, popping up in French and Spanish newspapers, as well as U.S. channels like NBC News.

Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev tweeted “congrats to lettuce” shortly after Truss’ speech.

Having been formally appointed by Queen Elizabeth II on Sept. 6, Truss is now by far the shortest-serving prime minister in British history. The previous record holder, George Canning, lasted 119 days in the early 19th century; Truss will serve about 50. (Thatcher ended her tenure in 1990 as the longest-serving British prime minster of the 20th century.)

A leadership contest to decide the next leader of the Conservative Party, who will by default become the next prime minister, is now underway and will conclude in the next week. The opposition Labour Party called for an immediate general election.

The future is less clear for the lettuce, but the rot has likely set in and the trash heap of history is its most likely destination."
Teacher would rather be redeployed to Iraq than go back to the classroom,https://www.wbrc.com/2022/04/14/teacher-would-rather-be-redeployed-iraq-than-go-back-classroom/?fbclid=IwAR3MRLEeaiT5e2vSzB5oZppZGV_hVjTuVsRn4jwfgFH5QZ_z9Rw7me2ciGY,nottheonion,"CHARLESTON, S.C. (WCSC/Gray News) – As a sergeant in the U.S. Army, Justin Bullock has endured demanding training, strict military discipline and even enemy fire, but nothing could prepare him for the stress and violence he faced as a teacher at Liberty Hill Academy.

“I have a lot of trauma now,” Bullock told WCSC.

He was deployed to Iraq in 2009 and was preparing to begin training to become a drill sergeant to instruct new soldiers. He says his future is now in jeopardy after suffering multiple injuries at Liberty Hill.

“I doubt that I will probably step my foot back inside a school in general for a very long time. I am terrified ... I don’t want to get beaten anymore,” Bullock said. “I don’t want to get sexually harassed any more. I don’t want to fear for my life.”

Last month, Bullock attempted to break up a fight between two students and was punched in the head multiple times.

He continued working but the next day went to the hospital where they took a brain scan and determined that he had a neck strain and was recovering from a concussion.

“By that Saturday, I was having major anxiety just like rethinking everything because I was also beaten in the back of my head in February 2021 by a student,” Bullock said. “I was also sexually harassed by a student who was also putting his hands on me. It took the school two and a half months to get him out of my classroom.”

Bullock was also diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.

His husband, Caleb Ferrell, says he doesn’t want Bullock to go back to work.

“Honestly, I get terrified sometimes. He wakes up at night and has a hard time sleeping. It’s honestly heartbreaking,” Ferrell said. “Sometimes I am afraid that he’s not going to come home after work.”

Liberty Hill Academy is an alternative school for special needs students and those with behavioral issues.

Teachers and staff are given extra training, and Bullock has even taught at alternative schools in other districts, but he says they are wholly unprepared to deal with some of these students.

“I definitely felt like the upper administration needs to reevaluate the situation,” Bullock said. “This has become a really dangerous situation, and we really need to make some changes before a real, true tragedy occurs.”

Bullock is one of multiple staff members at Liberty Hill who have been assaulted by students.

On March 31, two staff members were injured breaking up a fight.

In December, former employee Vera Gordon filed a lawsuit alleging constant abuse from 2016 until the time she left in 2020.

Gordon’s lawsuit describes female employees “being punched in their face by students, headbutted, drugged [sic] by their hair, having trash cans slammed over their head, knocked unconscious, subjected to frequent racial and sexual slurs.”

She said these factors generally led to a state of heightened anxiety and fear while at work.

In March alone, the North Charleston Police Department was called to the school 14 times. On Friday, the Charleston County School District confirmed another fight among students was broken up by a number of teachers.

Given the choice between the classroom and deployment, Bullock said he’d take deployment.

“Iraq a million times over,” Bullock said. “Because at least I know that my chain of command has my back.”

Next week, Bullock is meeting with his commanding officer to see if he is still mentally fit for military service.

Quidditch rebrands as quadball and further distances itself from Harry Potter author,https://www.npr.org/2022/07/19/1112324298/quidditch-rebrands-as-quadball-and-further-distances-itself-from-harry-potter-au,nottheonion,"Quidditch rebrands as quadball and further distances itself from Harry Potter author

Enlarge this image toggle caption Major League Quidditch Major League Quidditch

Fans of quidditch are now fans of quadball, the new name for the real-life sport that was first inspired by the Harry Potter book series.

U.S. Quidditch and Major League Quidditch announced the name change on Tuesday as well as their own rebranding as U.S. Quadball and Major League Quadball. The groups announced their intention to find a new name for the sport in December, citing what they called anti-trans positions of Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling.

In addition to distancing themselves from the author, organizers hope the name change will give the sport more opportunities to grow and not be inhibited by the trademark for ""quidditch"" being owned by Warner Bros.

""Bringing full creative control of the name of our sport to the vibrant community of players and fans that has grown and sustained it will allow our organizations to take the next step,"" MLQ co-commissioner Amanda Dallas said in a statement. ""We are now able to pursue the kinds of opportunities that our community has dreamed about for years.""

Fans and players were polled as part of the name change process, MLQ said, with ""quadball"" receiving ""strong support across demographic groups in the surveys.""

The rules of the sport will remain the same, with four balls on the field and four different positions. Both of those are referenced in the new name.

The names of those positions and the balls will remain the same for now, but MLQ notes that both could change at a later date.

The first quidditch match took place at Middlebury College in Vermont in 2005, where the game was created by Alex Benepe and Xander Manshel. Benepe called the name change a ""bold move.""

""For me personally there is definitely some nostalgia to the original name, but from a long term development perspective I feel confident this is a smart decision for the future that will allow the sport to grow without limits into its own unique space for many years to come,"" he said in a statement.

During the sport's initial years, many were drawn to it because of the connection with the blockbuster book and movie series, but since then it has become known as an intense, full-contact sport full of athleticism. It's now played in at least 40 countries with nearly 600 teams in existence.

While the inspiration for Harry Potter may remain a draw for some, MLQ media outreach coordinator Jack McGovern said it's important for the sport to remain welcoming to everyone.

""I think our leagues have always and still attract people from lots of different backgrounds. People who come to the sport because they are Harry Potter fans and people who come to the sport because they are looking for an outlet for athletics in their life,"" McGovern said. ""The sport has also always drawn heavily from the LGBTQ+ community and maintaining a welcoming space for all of those people who might be interested in the sport is really important to us.""

The change in name has already been adopted by USQ and MLQ will officially adopt the new name after the 2022 MLQ Championship on Aug. 20 to 22 in Howard County, Md.

The International Quidditch Association also plans to adopt the sports news name following the conclusion of the IQA European Games this weekend."
"In Utah, no child support, no hunting or fishing",https://phl17.com/nmw/in-utah-no-child-support-no-hunting-or-fishing/,nottheonion,"This is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.

(NewsNation) — Utah is seeing a surge in child support payments over the past year, a change that state officials credit in part to a new state law that withholds hunting and fishing licenses to people who fall significantly behind on payments.

“I came up with the idea for the bill, actually, in talking with some of my constituents who had noncustodial partners that were overdue on child support and going out and spending lots and lots of money hunting and fishing,” said state Rep. Karianne Lisonbee, who authored and passed the bill enacting the new law two years ago. It went into effect in 2021.

The law blocks anyone from obtaining a hunting or fishing license if they are past due more than $2,500 in child support for a year.

“A lot of people talk about sending people to jail or prison instantly when they hear non-collection of child support, non-payment of child support. But in reality, if they’re going to prison or jail, they’re not working, so that’s not helping solve the problem,” said Utah Office of Recovery Services (ORS) director Liesa Stockdale, whose agency manages child support in the state. “And when they get out they have marks on their record, they have legal marks on their record that could prevent them from getting future employment. So that’s not helping. And then there’s a stigma for the children involved that their parent has had to go to jail or prison. And that’s not helping anything.”

In their conversations, Stockdale encouraged Lisonbee to think about “creative incentives” that are important to the people who owe child support but that wouldn’t impact their ability to support their children.

“I think that hunting and fishing are fairly popular in almost every state,” Lisonbee said.

Some states have embraced the policy, including Pennsylvania. Failure to make child support for three months allows the state to suspend a driver’s or professional license.

In Utah, data provided by Stockdale suggests child support payments have gone up since the law was put into place. On July 1, 2021, they blocked the hunting and fishing licenses of 2,959 individuals.

“Out of those people, when we looked at it again, this year, during the first week of July, 494 of those people had come into compliance with the law at some point during that first year,” she said.

Stockdale acknowledged that the law may not be the only reason the people caught up on child support.

“There’s really no way to 100% say that’s why these people were paying their support, I want to be honest and upfront about that,” she said.

With that context in mind, Stockdale reports an increase in payments by nearly $2 million a year after the new law took effect, specifically coming from the individuals whose licenses were withheld.

Lisonbee also worked with lawmakers to update the law this year to add flexibility to its enforcement. One change she made was to allow individuals to still obtain licenses if they missed one month’s payment because of a transition to a new job.

Ultimately, Stockdale believes that Utah’s experience provides a lesson about how creative solutions can be used to change people’s behavior.

“It’s a matter of finding that right incentive for your community, even for different parents within your community,” she said. “Two-thousand nine hundred and fifty-nine individuals, that’s only a small portion of our parents who owe child support. And we need to continue to be creative to find those little incentive niches that will speak to different parents and will mean something to them.”"

There are new details about a Weatherford detective accused of stealing drugs. He has been charged with larceny. But an attorney who spoke to KOCO 5 said the charges don’t fit the crime. >> Previous coverage: Weatherford police detective charged after allegedly stealing drugs from evidence roomCourt documents show the detective stole 99 fentanyl pills from the evidence room at the Weatherford Police Department. “This guy stole it from a police evidence locker and that just erodes the public’s faith and trust in their institutions,” criminal defense attorney Brett Chapman said. Detective Jeremy Anderson faces two charges: neglect to perform a duty and larceny for the alleged theft.The pills appear to have been confiscated from a 2021 arrest. The arresting officer in that case was listed as a witness in the detective’s case. The suspect who was arrested with the pills the first time was charged with drug trafficking, which can carry a sentence of up to 20 years. Larceny carries up to 10 years. “I think this really highlights the disparate treatment of people across the state with drug charges,” Chapman said."
Gay police chief says he pushed for diversity in upper ranks — and that got him fired. His supporters are wondering why,https://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/fort-lauderdale/fl-ne-police-chief-fired-why-fort-lauderdale-20220305-udlz4qk6w5dd7nihmapxtl2ivi-story.html,nottheonion,"Fort Lauderdale — Pointed questions are swirling over the swift termination of Larry Scirotto, an outsider from Pittsburgh fired amid allegations of reverse discrimination after just six months as chief of the Fort Lauderdale Police Department.

Scirotto, the son of a white mother and Black father and the department’s first gay chief, was held in high regard by some who saw him as a dynamic and charismatic leader charged with bringing long-awaited change to an agency mired in use-of-force complaints.

Now experts say the city is facing a legal quagmire, with potential lawsuits from both Scirotto and at least four officers claiming discrimination. The waters got even more muddy on Friday, when the city auditor released a report accusing Scirotto of working a second job as a referee for the NCAA while on the city clock — a claim Scirotto dismisses as false.

Eugene O’Donnell, a law professor with John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Now York, questioned whether Fort Lauderdale made the right choice in making an outside hire who spent his career far away in Pittsburgh. The fact that Scirotto was moonlighting as a college basketball referee didn’t help, he said.

“You’re parachuting someone in from the outside,” O’Donnell said. “They need a person with gravitas in that job. Bringing someone in who’s a stranger to the organization is really a challenge. You’re dealing with people who’ve spent decades there. Even a saintly outsider faces a lot of land mines in a police agency. You’re in a shark tank. An outsider has to be purer than Ceasar’s wife and above reproach.”

Scirotto, 48, was let go Thursday afternoon, six days after a report was sent to City Hall by an outside attorney who investigated claims the chief was making promotions based on race, gender or sexual orientation. The attorney, former prosecutor Gregg Rossman, was hired to handle the inquiry a month after three white officers and one Hispanic officer filed complaints in October with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the federal agency charged with investigating workplace discrimination.

Scirotto’s supporters are asking just what he did wrong.

On Friday, Scirotto said he was wondering the same thing. The way he sees it, he got fired for promoting diversity.

“If I die on the hill for promoting diversity, as I was charged by the city manager to do from the day I was hired, then I will sleep well at night,” he told the South Florida Sun Sentinel.

Management made it clear they were pushing for diversity in every division, including the police department, Scirotto said.

In the weeks after he was hired, Scirotto says he promoted 15 cops. Nine were white men. The other six were all minorities through ethnicity or gender.

Four people who were not chosen for promotions — three men and one woman — filed EEOC complaints.

“There would have been 12 white men, one white woman and two minorities if I had promoted as the complainants say I should have,” Scirotto said. “Damned if you do, damned if you don’t. What would the optics have been on that?”

City Manager Chris Lagerbloom, the man who hired Scirotto in mid-August and sent him on his way six months later, had little to say Friday.

[ RELATED: All eyes on new police chief. Can he fix Fort Lauderdale’s troubled agency? ]

Mayor Dean Trantalis and others on the city commission say they too have been cautioned by the city attorney to be careful about what they say regarding the chief’s termination.

That did not keep Trantalis from speaking.

“I’m very concerned about this report’s findings and conclusions,” he said. “I believe we owe it to the community to get to the bottom of what happened here. We have a chief who was hired to make changes — and clearly changes don’t sit well within the department. The chief comes in and does exactly what he was asked to do.”

Outrage over chief’s firing

Trantalis said he thought the chief should have the chance to respond to the allegations before being fired. Scirotto was outspoken about endeavoring to create a more diverse police department that mirrors the community, the mayor said.

“So we should only discriminate on the sly?” Trantalis said. “I’ve gotten outrage from everybody. White, Black. Everybody.”

Vice Mayor Heather Moraitis offered a different perspective.

“Based on the report by Gregg Rossman and the allegations on how [the chief] promoted people, I feel the city manager did the right thing by firing the chief,” she said. “I support hiring and promoting individuals based on merit and performance and not any other criteria.”

Rossman could not be reached for comment.

Several others declined to comment or did not return calls, including the union president, police department legal advisor Brad Weissman and several community activists who are normally quite vocal about the goings on at City Hall.

But some did agree to speak off the record. One supporter described Scirotto’s takedown as a “f------ hit job.”

Rossman’s report, dated Feb. 25, was not released to the Sun Sentinel until Thursday afternoon, the day of Scirotto’s firing.

According to the report, the chief, on more than one occasion, pointed to a wall in his conference room with photos of the department’s command staff and said, “That wall is too white” and “I’m gonna change that.”

Rossman also wrote that the chief admitted to making several statements about “The wall being too white” and not reflecting the community.

Rossman’s report cites the EEOC reference manual, which provides hypothetical examples of discrimination: “For example, a statement that there are ‘too many Asians’ in a department, made by a hiring official when discussing applicants, would be strong evidence supporting an Asian American’s failure-to-hire claim. Such a statement also would support a claim of hostile work environment by Asian American employees.”

Tonja Haddad Coleman, a Fort Lauderdale attorney representing all four officers who filed complaints with the EEOC, says every single one of her clients deserved to be promoted.

“They were all more than qualified, including the straight white female,” Coleman said. “He violated state and federal law. I applaud diversity. But white people also can be discriminated against.”

‘Hire the best person’

Longtime resident Chris Williams, who is friends with some of the department’s officers, spoke openly about the gripes he’d been hearing about Scirotto.

“The rank and file wasn’t behind him at all, from day one. They just had a bad vibe about the guy,” said Williams, president of the Coral Ridge Homeowners Association. “All I can tell you is that the police force is doing cartwheels right now.”

Williams said he is no fan of affirmative action, a set of policies and practices in the public and private sector that promote diversity-hiring practices.

“Let’s hire the best person,” Williams said. “Who cares if they’re purple or green.”

The law says you have to treat everyone equally, regardless of race or gender, says Brian Lerner, a labor attorney based in Fort Lauderdale.

“There is an exception under affirmative action that can justify making a hiring decision based on race,” Lerner said. “But you can’t say, ‘I’m only going to pick the Hispanic candidate or the woman or the man.’ That, by default, is illegal. You can’t pick someone because of their race, their gender, their religion.”

‘White men on the wall’

Some experts, speaking off the record, acknowledged it’s best not to broadcast your intentions when making hires and promotions — otherwise you might be accused of discrimination on both sides.

Laws addressing employment discrimination in this country are highly nuanced and complex, said Bob Jarvis, a constitutional law professor at Nova Southeastern University.

After decades of systemic racism, the nation embraced affirmative action in the 1960s in an attempt to level the playing field, Jarvis said.

Affirmative action aims to “overcome the effects of past or present practices ... or other barriers to equal employment opportunity,” according to the EEOC. But under the law, each job candidate must compete against all other qualified candidates, and quotas, struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1978, remain illegal.

And that’s what might have put Scirotto in the spotlight, Jarvis said.

“He was saying, ‘I don’t like the fact that there are white men on the wall,’ so he’s going to change it,” Jarvis said. “He’s not looking at them as people. He’s looking at them based on skin color. Just because we have had white men promoted in the past, it does not mean we flip the switch and go the other way. His statement was a clear statement of reverse discrimination.”

Scirotto defends his promotional choices and the process that led him there.

“It was clear in the messaging that diversity was a mandate for the new police chief,” he said Friday, the day after he learned of his dismissal. “It’s a mixed message. You say you want it until you have a leader that has spoken openly about diversity. And to suggest that you ended up with an unqualified candidate who is a minority is inaccurate and detrimental to the entire organization.”

Now some are asking what message the chief’s termination sends about Fort Lauderdale’s claim that the city has committed to the goal of creating a diverse workforce.

Lagerbloom declined to answer that question until he consulted with City Attorney Alain Boileau. He later sent a carefully worded response: “The city of Fort Lauderdale fully supports and remains committed to diversity in all forms, including but not limited to, in the context of employment, opportunities and services. However, the goal and advancement of diversity must always occur without discrimination, and by ensuring fairness and the equal treatment, opportunity and consideration of all individuals, regardless and without consideration of, gender, race, color, age, ethnicity, religion, national origin, disability, gender identity or sexual orientation.”

‘What the hell?’

But Commissioner Steve Glassman says he still has many questions and serious concerns about what transpired, and says he is waiting to hear more from the city manager.

“I don’t think it sends any message until we have all of the facts and all of the information,” Glassman said. “We are hiring a diversity officer, for crying out loud. That shows our commitment to diversity. If diversity is our goal, how could our chief be fired for wanting more diversity in our command positions? Many people are wondering, ‘What the hell?’”

Some promotions made under Scirotto’s watch will not necessarily be rescinded, Lagerbloom said. But it’s a possibility.

“I do believe we have to redo the process,” he said. “We’re going to have to do a redo of the promotional process and get HR involved to make sure it’s fair. There were several promotions that were affected. I don’t know how many.”

Again, Scirotto doubled down.

“Every person I promoted was beyond qualified — including the nine white men,” he said. “The people that were promoted that were of minority status were beyond qualified. The people that were not selected were not qualified to sit in those positions. The people who were selected were very qualified. And they just happened to be of minority status.”

"I wish women could decide abortion law, says Republican man who backs ban",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/oct/08/republican-abortion-women-john-curtis-utah?,nottheonion,"Despite his party’s staunch opposition to terminating pregnancies, Congressman John Curtis, a Utah Republican, said at a debate this week that he wished women could decide whether abortion should be legal.

“I wish, as a man, I didn’t have to make this decision,” John Curtis said, referring to how the state legislatures which are now empowered to decide the legality of abortion are dominated by men. “I wish women could make this decision.”

Curtis’s remarks came during a debate on Thursday night while seeking re-election as the US House representative for Utah’s third congressional district, a seat he has held since 2017.

The non-partisan Cook Political Report considers Curtis to be solidly Republican, representing an area that includes Provo, a city of more than 100,000 people. Nonetheless, at Thursday’s debate hosted by Brigham Young University in Provo, he expressed a position that prompted a reaction of surprise from his Democratic challenger, Glen Wright.

Curtis alluded to the June ruling by the US supreme court’s conservative majority that eliminated the federal abortion right which the landmark case Roe v Wade established in 1973. Roe’s reversal made each state’s government responsible for determining if getting an abortion was legal in its jurisdiction.

Since the ruling, only 21 American states had laws protecting abortion access, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights. Meanwhile, 26 states had prohibited, severely limited or were expected to impede access to abortion.

Curtis, 62, on Friday acknowledged men held most of the seats in the legislatures determining whether pregnant people could legally obtain abortions in their state and that “if you’re a woman, it stinks”.

“I wish it were other than that,” Curtis added. “I wish, as a man, I didn’t have to make this decision. I wish women could make this decision.”

Nonetheless, Curtis made it a point to clarify that he was “unapologetically pro-life”, a label preferred by those who oppose abortion rights.

Wright glanced upward and moved his head to the side as if he couldn’t believe what he was hearing Curtis say. The vast majority of Republicans and their conservative supporters hailed the supreme court’s decision to eliminate federal abortion rights. The South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, one of the GOP’s pre-eminent figures, even proposed that Republicans push for a national ban on abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.

Republicans were split over Graham’s proposal as November’s midterm elections loomed after some polling has found that as many as 60% of voters support abortion rights in most or all cases.

The Democrats are trying to emerge from the midterms with their razor-thin advantages in both congressional chambers still intact.

Curtis is not expected to have trouble winning another congressional term in his district. A poll published by FiveThirtyEight on 13 September found Curtis leading Wright by 25 percentage points."
"Man who received landmark pig heart transplant died of pig virus, surgeon says",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/06/man-landmark-pig-heart-transplant-death-pig-virus,nottheonion,"The 57-year-old patient who survived two months after undergoing a landmark pig heart transplant may have died of a pig virus, his transplant surgeon announced last month.

In January, David Bennett, a handyman who suffered from heart failure, underwent a highly experimental surgery at the University of Maryland medical center in which doctors transplanted a genetically modified pig’s heart into him.

Shortly after undergoing the surgery, Bennett died in March. The hospital simply said his condition had worsened over the span of a few days but did not provide an exact cause of death.

Last month, Bennett’s transplant surgeon, Bartley Griffith, revealed that the pig’s heart was infected with a porcine virus known as porcine cytomegalovirus, which may have contributed to Bennett’s death. In a webinar hosted by the American Society of Transplantation on 20 April, Griffith described the virus and doctors’ attempts to treat it, MIT Technology Review first reported on Wednesday.

“We are beginning to learn why he passed on,” said Griffith, adding, “[the virus] maybe was the actor, or could be the actor, that set this whole thing off.”

According to experts, the transplant was a “major test of xenotransplantation,” a process that involves transferring tissues between different species. They believe that the experiment may have been derailed as a result of an “unforced error”, as the pigs that were bred to provide organs are supposed to be free of viruses.

“If this was an infection, we can likely prevent it in the future,” Griffith said during the webinar.

The biggest challenge in animal-to-human organ transplants is the resilience of the human immune system, as it can attack foreign cells in a process called rejection and trigger a response that will ultimately destroy the transplanted organ or tissue.

As a result, companies have been biologically engineering pigs by removing and adding various genes to help conceal their tissues from potential immune attacks. The heart used in Bennett’s case came from a pig that underwent 10 gene modifications carried out by Revivicor, a biotechnology company.

Despite worries that xenotransplantation could trigger a pandemic if a virus were to adapt within a human body and spread to others, experts believe that the specific type of virus in Bennett’s donor heart is not capable of infecting human cells.

According to Jay Fishman, a specialist in transplant infections at Massachusetts General hospital, there is “no real risk to humans” of it spreading to others. Rather, the concern stems from the ability of porcine cytomegalovirus to trigger reactions that can damage and destroy not only the organ, but also the patient.

Experts are hesitant to fully attribute Bennett’s death to the virus. According to Joachim Denner, a researcher at Free University of Berlin’s Institute of Virology, “This patient was very, very, very ill. Do not forget that … Maybe the virus contributed but it was not the sole reason.”

Two years ago, Denner led a study in which researchers reported that pig hearts transplanted into baboons lasted only several weeks if they contained porcine cytomegalovirus. On the other hand, hearts that were free of the infection were able to survive over six months.

Shortly after Bennett’s surgery, Griffith and his team had frequently monitored his recovery through various blood tests. In one of the tests, doctors examined Bennett’s blood for traces of various viruses and bacterias and found “a little blip” that indicated the presence of porcine cytomegalovirus. However, because its levels were so low, the doctors assumed that the result could have been an error.

Griffith also revealed that because the special blood test was taking approximately 10 days to carry out, doctors were unable to know that the virus was already beginning to multiply rapidly. As a result, this may have triggered a reaction that Griffith now believes was likely “cytokine explosion,” a storm of exaggerated immune response that can cause serious issues.

On the 43rd day of the experiment, doctors discovered that Bennett was breathing hard and warm to the touch. “He looked really funky. Something happened to him. He looked infected,” said Griffith, adding, “He lost his attention and wouldn’t talk to us.”

In attempts to fight Bennett’s infection while keeping his immune system under control, doctors provided him with intravenous immunoglobulin as well as cidofovir, a drug sometimes used in Aids patients. Bennett displayed signs of recovery after 24 hours before his condition worsened again.

“I personally suspect he developed a capillary leak in response to his inflammatory explosion, and that filled his heart with edema, the edema turned into fibrotic tissue, and he went into severe and unreversing diastolic heart failure,” Griffith said in the webinar."

A Colorado Library has voted to ban book bans,https://www.coloradoan.com/story/news/local/2022/09/14/wellington-board-trustees-book-ban-public-library-through-resolution/69493542007/?fbclid=IwAR3luUJlRRqWC18kYO3YrJMBl1v8r01kPIJB56bvZ_45t345mLINnbHVMGw,nottheonion,"Nearly a month after a resident group sought to ban or restrict books at Wellington's public library, the town's governing board voted in favor of a resolution that prevents the board from restricting access to materials at the library.

The resolution passed 5-2. Trustee Jon Gaiter voted against the resolution, and Trustee David Wiegand voted to abstain, which is counted as a ""no"" vote, Town Administrator Patti Garcia said.

The resolution was put forth by Trustee Rebekka Dailey in response to the board's meeting Aug. 9, when a group of residents led by Christine Gaiter — wife of Trustee Jon Gaiter — expressed concern over the ""sexual content"" in a list of books available in the Wellington Public Library. Christine Gaiter submitted a list of 19 books to the board that included popular titles like E.L. James' ""Fifty Shades of Grey,"" Stephen Chbosky's ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" and Toni Morrison's ""The Bluest Eye.""

Christine Gaiter said during the August board meeting that she had concerns over the books that “go into too much detail of a sexual act,” and that they were not appropriate for children. In her comments Tuesday night, Christine Gaiter referred to the books as “pornographic materials,"" and said the public library should not “endorse children to read pornography without a parent's permission.”

Some residents at the Aug. 9 meeting asked for a book ban. Christine Gaiter told the board Tuesday that she never wanted to ban the books but she did want the library to implement more restrictions so that children could not access the books without a parent's permission. During the Aug. 9 meeting, she had asked the board to put the 19 books where children would not be able to access them without permission from an adult.

An overwhelming majority of residents who packed the community board room Tuesday made public comments to the board in favor of the resolution that effectively bans any book ban at the library.

“Kids deserve a place to go to explore and learn,” said Dylan Delehoy, a Wellington resident. Delehoy opened his comments saying the need for the resolution “paints a sad picture of our town.”

One of Wellington’s younger residents also chose to address the board.

“Not to be rude, but you can’t tell me what I can and can’t read,” Sienna Zadina said.

Comments from both residents and trustees expressed a desire for the town to find common ground.

“We need to get together and do what’s best for this community,” said John Hunter, another Wellington resident. Hunter called the resolution a good step forward for the community. “We can find a way to come through this.”

Several comments elicited tears from the audience and trustees as two residents shared powerful personal testimonies of surviving suicide attempts and sexual abuse because public libraries gave them access to books that made them feel understood and less alone.

After a little more than an hour of public comments, the board took a five-minute recess before making their own comments and voting on the resolution.

Mayor pro-tem Ashley Macdonald thanked residents who “had the courage to share their survivor stories today. I do not have the courage to share my survivor story today, but if it wasn’t for the public library,” Macdonald paused and choked back tears before continuing her comments. “I didn’t get my education from pornography.""

Dailey also spoke to the decision to refer to the books as pornography.

“To allege that (library) staff are providing pornography to children, it’s obviously not true, it’s disgusting,” Dailey said.

“This isn’t about left or right, this is about parenting,"" Macdonald said. “I don’t want anyone in this room telling me how to parent my child and I won’t tell you how to parent yours.”

Jon Gaiter said as the acting library board, their job is to make decisions on what books do and do not end up in the library, something the library already does regularly. He said he could not support the resolution because it didn't ""support the mission of the library.""

David Weigand, who ultimately abstained from the vote, said he’d like to discuss the resolution in a work session to include stipulations, like what Jon Gaiter discussed, to develop guidelines on how the library board makes decisions on which titles to include. He also said he would support developing information for parents to inform them of the content in some of the books available at the library.

Trustee Shirrell Tietz also said she would be in favor of discussing the library board’s guidelines on how they decide which titles are included in the library, but ultimately voted in favor of the resolution.

Mayor Calar Chaussee agreed with Macdonald that this was ultimately a parenting issue.

Trustee Brian Mason also voted for the resolution, citing his time in the Marine Corps, where he said he fought to protect these very freedoms.

After the board made its decision, Christine Gaiter told the Coloradoan she was glad the issue was brought up and hopes by bringing this to light, the board might make changes later on.

“It’s sad that they don’t want to protect the children,” she said.

What's in the resolution the board approved?

The official resolution the town board passed Tuesday night defines the Wellington Public Library's mission ""to serve and reflect every member of our community in an enlightened, democratic, and unified approach.""

It also stipulates the board cannot ""censor, suppress, remove, monitor or place age restrictions on ideas or information in our public library.""

The Wellington Public Library does have age limits for library cards. You must be at least 12 in order to sign up for a library card, and anyone under the age of 18 has to have a parent’s signature on their application to get a library card, Wellington Library staff told the Coloradoan. Children 11 and younger can still check out books, but it has to be on their parent's library card.

""The vision of the Wellington Public Library is to promote curiosity, knowledge and exploration while fostering a safe and inclusive place for our community,"" said RossLaGenèse, Wellington Public Library's director, in a statement emailed to the Coloradoan. ""The library is grateful for the support from our Mayor, Board of Trustees, and community to continue the library’s mission of providing access for all."""
Church of Ireland minister urges free food facility to close for Queen Elizabeth's funeral,https://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2022/09/14/news/church_of_ireland_minister_urges_free_food_facility_to_close_for_queen_elizabeth_s_funeral-2827538/,nottheonion,"A Church of Ireland minister has urged a community group to close a popular free food facility in a mainly nationalist Co Derry town for the funeral of Queen Elizabeth

Rev Mark Loney, who is rector at Dungiven and Bovevagh Church of Ireland, wrote to Dungiven Regeneration Club earlier this week.

It hosts the local 'Community Fridge', which encourages people to donate goods that are then redistributed.

Rev Loney sits on the regeneration group's committee.

Details of the email emerged after it was revealed that Rev Loney's wife, Jo, has also contacted businesses in the town asking if they intended to close.

In his email to Dungiven Regeneration Club on Monday, headed 'The Queen's funeral', Rev Loney suggested the group close it's busy food facility.

He wrote: ""However, would it be helpful for the committee, whatever their constitutional allegiances or none to formally endorse the closure of the 'Community Fridge' on that day as a token of respect for those in the environs of Dungiven for whom the Monarch's death is a significant occasion to mark with the deepest respect.""

The minister also suggested a formula of words the group could use adding that it was ""something of a sore point"" that two named local businesses do not intend to close.

Speaking to the Irish News last night Rev Loney said ""there are people parading the fact that we have good cross community relations and that we need to see each others perspective and so forth.

""I think it would be a good thing if people go an extra mile and actually say, we are not endorsing monarchy or anything else,"" he said.

""We will close because you as a valued part of our community have a particular concern or sympathy with what's going on at the moment and we will join you in that.""

Rev Loney also referenced the actions of some Sinn Féin representatives over recent days.

""Given that Michelle O'Neill and significant republican elements attended a service of reflection at St Anne's Cathedral in honour of her majesty the Queen was leading by example,"" he said.

Jo Loney confirmed she had contacted two businesses.

Asked if it is true that she encouraged the businesses to close next Monday she said: ""I would expect that would happen but I wouldn't want to say anything further than that.

Pressed on why she would want businesses to close she said: ""I would expect a bit of decency.

""Like for example if the Pope died I would expect any cross community facility to close as well and I would be endorsing that.""

Sinn Féin councillor Sean McGlinchey said that to close a food facility was wrong.

""People don't stop eating or needing help because it's a bank holiday,"" he said.

""I am sure even the Queen would not want a food bank to close.""

""People are entitled to respect the Queen in whatever way they want but to phone businesses and ask them to close is another thing.

""It's very disrespectful to the wider community of Dungiven."""

“Utah Lawmaker Says She Believes Women Can Control ‘Intake of Semen’ During Sex”,https://www.self.com/story/karianne-lisonbee-says-women-control-semen-intake-during-sex,nottheonion,"Karianne Lisonbee, a member of the Utah House of Representatives, recently said that she believes women can control the “intake of semen” during sex. (Yes, really.)

The Republican lawmaker, who has been in office since 2017, expressed this belief during a press conference held after Roe V. Wade was overturned on June 24, putting abortion out of reach for millions of Americans.

Lisonbee’s straight-up false notions about what a vagina can do during sex came in response to a text she received when Roe was overturned, according to reporting by The Salt Lake Tribune: “I received a text message today saying I should seek to control men’s ejaculations and not women’s pregnancies and that I clearly don’t trust women enough to make choices to control their own body,” Representative Lisonbee said.

She then outlined her response to such a claim to reporters. “And my response is: I do trust women enough to control when they allow a man to ejaculate inside of them and to control that intake of semen. So, that may be inflammatory, but I think as a legislature we have the responsibility to create a legal framework that is friendly and supporting rights.”

We regret that we even have to say this, but: Representative Lisonbee’s claims are physiologically inaccurate. Once semen has entered the vagina, people with vaginas can’t do Kegel exercises—or any other practices—as a method of birth control, nor can they do anything after the fact to remove the semen and prevent pregnancy.

Also worth noting: Her notion that people can essentially control when they are impregnated doesn’t account for cases in which pregnancy occurs after sexual assault, or situations in which people can become pregnant nonconsensually even if they consented to sex. (For instance, stealthing, nonconsensual condom removal during intercourse, can lead to pregnancy.) All of this to say: People with vaginas can’t control semen intake during sex—one of many reasons abortion is essential to their health and wellbeing.

Utah was one of many states that enacted a “trigger law” after Roe was overturned, banning abortions throughout the state. The trigger law was temporarily paused, but another law that restricts abortion, known as HB136, took effect after that, according to reporting from ABC4.com. Under HB136, people in Utah can only get an abortion after 18 weeks in cases of rape, incest, fatal fetal defect, severe brain abnormality, if the mother’s life is in danger, or if the mother may be permanently impaired without access to abortion.

In a statement to SELF, Representative Lisonbee said, “My response did not reflect what I intended to express,” adding that she supports victims of rape and incest.

A previous version of this story has been updated to reflect a new statement from Representative Lisonbee.

$2.9 million worth of meth disguised as onions seized at California border,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/meth-onions-seized-california-border/,nottheonion,"Drug overdose deaths skyrocket nearly 30% to 93,000 in 2020

Authorities have seized approximately 1,336 pounds of methamphetamine disguised as onions in Southern California, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said Friday. The confiscated drugs are worth an estimated $2.9 million, authorities said.

""This was not only a clever attempt to try and smuggle in narcotics, one I haven't seen before, but also time consuming to wrap narcotics into these small packages, designed to look like onions,"" Sidney Aki, director of field operations in San Diego, said in a statement.

On February 20, border patrol officers inspected a tractor trailer carrying a shipment indicated as onions. An officer referred the 46-year-old driver and the items for a ""more intense examination,"" where a canine team screened the tractor trailer. A dog alerted to the shipment, which prompted officers to search it further.

That's when authorities discovered almost 1,200 packages of methamphetamine shaped in ""small globes with a white covering"" that were mixed with actual sacks of onions, CBP said.

""While we have certainly seen narcotics in produce before, it's unusual for us to see this level of detail in the concealment,"" Aki said.

"Lead exposure in last century shrank IQ scores of half of Americans, study finds",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/03/220307162011.htm,nottheonion,"In 1923, lead was first added to gasoline to help keep car engines healthy. However, automotive health came at the great expense of our own health and well-being.

A new study calculates that exposure to car exhaust from leaded gas during childhood stole a collective 824 million IQ points from more than 170 million Americans alive today, about half the population of the United States.

The findings, from Aaron Reuben, a PhD candidate in clinical psychology at Duke University, and colleagues at Florida State University, suggest that Americans born before 1996 may now be at greater risk for lead-related health problems, such as faster aging of the brain. Leaded gas for cars was banned in the U.S. in 1996, but the researchers say that anyone born before the end of that era, and especially those at the peak of its use in the 1960s and 1970s, had concerningly high lead exposures as children.

The team's paper appeared the week of March 7 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Lead is neurotoxic and can erode brain cells after it enters the body. As such, there is no safe level of exposure at any point in life, health experts say. Young children are especially vulnerable to lead's ability to impair brain development and lower cognitive ability. Unfortunately, no matter what age, our brains are ill-equipped for keeping it at bay.

""Lead is able to reach the bloodstream once it's inhaled as dust, or ingested, or consumed in water,"" Reuben said. ""In the bloodstream, it's able to pass into the brain through the blood-brain barrier, which is quite good at keeping a lot of toxicants and pathogens out of the brain, but not all of them.""

One major way lead used to invade bloodstreams was through automotive exhaust.

To answer the complex question of how leaded gas use for more than 70 years may have left a permanent mark on human health, Reuben and his co-authors Michael McFarland and Mathew Hauer, both professors of sociology at Florida State University, opted for a fairly simple strategy.

Using publicly available data on U.S. childhood blood-lead levels, leaded-gas use, and population statistics, they determined the likely lifelong burden of lead exposure carried by every American alive in 2015. From this data, they estimated lead's assault on our intelligence by calculating IQ points lost from leaded gas exposure as a proxy for its harmful impact on public health.

The researchers were stunned by the results.

""I frankly was shocked,"" McFarland said. ""And when I look at the numbers, I'm still shocked even though I'm prepared for it.""

As of 2015, more than 170 million Americans (more than half of the U.S. population) had clinically concerning levels of lead in their blood when they were children, likely resulting in lower IQs and putting them at higher risk for other long-term health impairments, such as reduced brain size, greater likelihood of mental illness, and increased cardiovascular disease in adulthood.

Leaded gasoline consumption rose rapidly in the early 1960s and peaked in the 1970s. As a result, Reuben and his colleagues found that essentially everyone born during those two decades are all but guaranteed to have been exposed to pernicious levels of lead from car exhaust.

Even more startling was lead's toll on intelligence: childhood lead exposure may have blunted America's cumulative IQ score by an estimated 824 million points -- nearly three points per person on average. The researchers calculated that at its worst, people born in the mid-to-late 1960s may have lost up to six IQ points, and children registering the highest levels of lead in their blood, eight times the current minimum level to initiate clinical concern, fared even worse, potentially losing more than seven IQ points on average.

Dropping a few IQ points may seem negligible, but the authors note that these changes are dramatic enough to potentially shift people with below-average cognitive ability (IQ score less than 85) to being classified as having an intellectual disability (IQ score below 70).

Moving forward, McFarland is analyzing the racial disparities of childhood lead exposure, hoping to highlight the health inequities suffered by Black children, who were exposed more often to lead and in greater quantities than white children.

Reuben's next step will be to examine the long-term consequences of past lead exposure on brain health in old age, based on previous findings that adults with high childhood lead exposure may experience accelerated brain aging.

""Millions of us are walking around with a history of lead exposure,"" Reuben said. ""It's not like you got into a car accident and had a rotator cuff tear that heals and then you're fine. It appears to be an insult carried in the body in different ways that we're still trying to understand but that can have implications for life."""
"McConnell says Republicans may not win Senate control, citing 'candidate quality'",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/mcconnell-says-republicans-may-not-win-senate-control-citing-candidate-rcna43777,nottheonion,"WASHINGTON — Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday downplayed expectations of Republicans capturing control of the Senate in the fall elections, describing “candidate quality” as an important factor.

“I think there’s probably a greater likelihood the House flips than the Senate. Senate races are just different — they're statewide, candidate quality has a lot to do with the outcome,” he said in Florence, Kentucky, at a Northern Kentucky Chamber of Commerce luncheon when asked about his projection for the 2022 election.

“Right now, we have a 50-50 Senate and a 50-50 country, but I think when all is said and done this fall, we’re likely to have an extremely close Senate, either our side up slightly or their side up slightly.”

Even though history strongly favors the party out of power — in this case the GOP — to make gains in midterm races, McConnell has long worried that subpar candidates could play into Democrats' hands.

While he didn't mention any names, there are examples across the country.

In Pennsylvania's open Senate race, the nonpartisan Cook Political Report changed its rating Thursday from ""toss up"" to ""lean Democrat"" as GOP nominee Mehmet Oz, a celebrity doctor, struggles against Democrat John Fetterman, the state's lieutenant governor, who leads in recent polls.

Apart from Oz, Republicans have nominated numerous first-time candidates backed by former President Donald Trump in states such as Georgia, Arizona and Ohio to run against seasoned Democratic politicians. The Senate Leadership Fund, a group aligned with McConnell, recently bought $28 million worth of airtime in Ohio to support Republican nominee J.D. Vance.

The Republican Party establishment also failed to recruit preferred candidates in other states, like New Hampshire.

McConnell may be feeling déjà vu from 2010 and 2012 when his party fell short of capturing control of the chamber in part due to weak candidates such as Christine O’Donnell in Delaware, Sharron Angle in Nevada and Todd Akin in Missouri.

Despite their woes with candidates, Republicans still have opportunities to add to their ranks. They need a net gain of just one seat to seize control of the Senate from the Democrats and effectively gain veto power over President Joe Biden's legislative agenda and nominees for top administration positions and judgeships."

(AP Photo/Eric Risberg)

SAN JOSE, Calif. -- The Berkeley man suspected in the attack on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband has a history of inflammatory social media posts tying conspiracy theories to the COVID pandemic and 2020 presidential election.

San Francisco police on Friday identified David Depape, 42, as the man suspected of breaking into Pelosi’s San Francisco home early Friday morning and shouting “Where’s Nancy?” before attacking her husband Paul Pelosi with a hammer. Nancy Pelosi was in Washington and not at home.

A complicated picture of Depape’s fringe beliefs began to surface Friday through his online presence and connection to a Bay Area nude activist community. An online blog, Facebook page, and personal website included virulent viewpoints, spanning anti-Semitism, promotion of the far-right QAnon theory, and 2020 election denialism.

A blog, which lists Depape as the author, includes a flurry of posts slamming “woke racists,” proclaiming that Hitler “did nothing wrong,” and lauding podcaster Joe Rogan.

[Paul Pelosi’s covert 911 call allowed police to intervene in San Francisco attack, sources say]

A main focus of Depape’s anger in recent weeks also appears to be social media restrictions. “Tech giants and private industry would be so powerful they could single handedly silence the people,” he wrote on his blog. The blog site, which is now removed, was titled: “Welcome to Big Brothers Censorship hell”

Depape’s stepfather Gene Depape told CNN the alleged attacker grew up in Powell River, British Columbia, and left Canada about two decades ago.

“I really don’t know what to think,” the suspect’s uncle, Mark Depape told CNN. “Hopefully it’s a scam. I don’t want to hear something like that.”

Depape’s name turns up in a series of local news articles connected to Oxane “Gypsy” Taub, a longtime Bay Area nude activist, who once attempted to hold a naked wedding in front of San Francisco City Hall. A 2008 article in The Oakland Tribune said Depape had three children with Taub.

A 2013 San Francisco Chronicle article referred to Depape as a “hemp jewelry maker and father figure” who doubled as best man at Taub’s wedding. Depape also attended a 2013 “nudity ban protest,” in 2013, according to a story in Indybay, an independent news site.

Linda Schneider, a Bay Area resident, told CNN she has known Depape for about eight years. Depape has housesat at her home, Schneider said.

She said Depape had lived in a storage unit in the Berkeley area and struggled with drug use but was “trying to create a new life for himself,” according to CNN.

Schneider said Depape later sent “really disturbing” emails. He sounded like a “megalomaniac and so out of touch with reality,” she said.

Depape “seemed so dangerous,” she said, claiming that Depape “using biblical justification to do harm.”"

"Scion of SF Coffee Dynasty Attempts Run for DA, Realizes He Needs to Be a Lawyer to Qualify",https://sfstandard.com/politics/elections/son-of-coffee-dynasty-fails-san-francisco-district-attorney-run/,nottheonion,"SAN FRANCISCO, CA - Austin Hills attends the de Gournay Celebrates Opening of New Boutique on March 1st 2017 at de Gournay Showroom in San Francisco, CA (Photo - Drew Altizer Photography)

An attempt to run for San Francisco District Attorney by the son of an elite coffee dynasty family was brought to an abrupt end this week when he was told that he could not enter the race because he was not an attorney.

Austin Hills, whose family founded Hills Bros. Coffee in San Francisco in the late 1800s, pulled papers to run for the office on Wednesday, according to the Department of Elections website.

The Standard made several attempts to contact Hills on Friday and visited his listed address but was told by a man who said he was Hills’ brother that Hills had been unsuccessful in his bid because had not realized that he needed to be an active attorney to run.

According to the latest copy of the eligibility requirements for San Francisco District Attorney, a person wishing to run for the position must have served as an attorney licensed to practice in California for at least five years prior to filing.

A search for Austin Hills on the California State Bar Attorney website garnered no results.

The 42-year-old is registered as a Libertarian, according to public voter information. And this doesn’t appear to be the first time he has attempted to run for public office: according to his Facebook posts, he registered to be an Independent write-in candidate for the 2016 presidential election.

Hills frequently lambasts SF’s Mayor London Breed on his social media accounts, in one example posting a photo of a person experiencing homelessness with the caption, “Thank you Mayor London Breed!” He also appears to be a fan of helicopters and skiing, according to his Facebook account.

The Hills family's coffee dynasty has a storied local legacy. The original Austin Hills, Sr. and his two sons sailed from New England to California in 1873 and began selling coffee and tea on Harrison Street in SF. In 1900, one of the sons invented vacuum packing, which is still the most popular method of packaging coffee today, according to the Hills Bros. website.

The Hills family appear to be city socialites. In 2010, Hills’ father hosted a Bollywood-themed wedding, where “saris were in full swing, some guests channeled the old British colony with pith helmets and khakis” according to SFGate coverage of the occasion. Danielle Steel and Nancy Pelosi attended.

Confirmed candidates to run in the November election so far include current DA Brooke Jenkins, former police commissioner John Hamasaki, Joe Alioto Veronese—another former police commissioner—and attorney Maurice Chenier.

"Paranoid Ezra Miller Wears Body Armor, Gun Everywhere as Alleged Victims Compare Him to Cult Leader",https://consequence.net/2022/08/ezra-miller-body-armor-gun-cult-leader/,nottheonion,"An increasingly paranoid Ezra Miller has taken to wearing bulletproof body armor and carrying at least one gun almost everywhere they go, according to a new report from Insider that traces a timeline of Miller’s activities and finds a disturbing pattern: They establish a home base, financially support artists and young women, and then attempt to control and manipulate their sexual partners, causing one of their alleged victims to compare the practice to a cult.

Miller allegedly believes that they are being followed by the FBI and Ku Klux Klan, the former because multiple parents and young people have accused the actor of grooming minors, and the latter because Miller released a video earlier this year demanding that members of the KKK kill themselves.

Tokata Iron Eyes, an 18-year-old traveling with Miller whose parents have sought a restraining order against the star, called the body armor “a fashionable safety measure in response to actual attacks and received death threats.”

Miller met Tokata in 2016 when she was a 12-years-old activist opposing the Dakota Access Pipeline. Miller flew Tokata to different places, including London for the premiere of their movie Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, and when she was 18, family friends saw the two of them having sex. Miller also reportedly asked to share a bed with Tokata when she was only 14, though a Tribal elder claims to have stopped them, and earlier this year her parents accused The Flash star of controlling their daughter with “violence, intimidation, threat of violence, fear, paranoia, delusions, and drugs.”

This was not an isolated incident. In 2020, the world first learned of Miller’s increasingly erratic behavior when a video showed them choking a woman in Iceland. But their time in Iceland was more eventful — and disquieting — than even that video would suggest.

During the two months Miller spent in Iceland, rumors spread among locals that the actor was running a cult out of an AirBnB. Permanent residents described him as an aggressive person with a revolting smell who rarely changed out of their clothes. Three people recalled Miller walking barefoot through Reykjavík, noting long, unclipped toenails and what may have been an infected gash on their foot."
San Antonio officer fired after shooting at teen sitting in McDonald's parking lot eating a burger,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/san-antonio-officer-fired-shooting-teen-sitting-mcdonalds-parking-lot-rcna51196,nottheonion,"A San Antonio police officer still in his probationary period was fired after he shot at and injured a 17-year-old boy in the parking lot of McDonald's, the department said Wednesday.

The teenager, Erik Cantu, is hospitalized with multiple gunshot wounds. His attorney, Brian Powers, said Saturday that Cantu is ""fighting for his life.""

The officer, identified as James Brennand, responded to the fast-food eatery on Blanco Road around 10:45 p.m. Sunday for an unrelated disturbance call, according to police.

""As the officer attempted to gather information from witnesses, he noticed a vehicle that had evaded him the day before as the officer attempted a stop because the registered license plate did not match the actual vehicle,"" Capt. Alyssa Campos, the department’s training commander, said in a video statement.

The car, driven by Cantu, was not the subject of the disturbance call at the McDonald's, according to Campos.

An officer opens the driver’s door and orders Erik Cantu out of the vehicle in San Antonio, Texas, on Oct. 2, 2022. San Antonio Police Dept.

The officer, believing the car was stolen, called ""for cover"" but approached the vehicle before other officers arrived, she said. Campos said the officer ""abruptly"" opened the driver's door and ordered Cantu to get out.

Police body-camera footage released by the department shows Cantu sitting in the driver's seat eating a McDonald's hamburger. A 17-year-old girl is in the passenger's seat.

""Get out of the car,"" the officer says to Cantu, the video shows.

Cantu put the car in reverse with the driver's door still open and backed up, Campos said, adding the officer was hit by the open door.

""The officer then stepped back and opened fire on the vehicle as the driver reversed away from him,"" she said.

Multiple gunshots can be heard in the video as the maroon car backs away and the driver's door closes. More shots are fired as the car flees the parking lot, the video shows.

Cantu and his passenger were found about a block away. The passenger was not injured. Police have not said if the car was, in fact, stolen.

Police charged Cantu with evading detention with a vehicle and assault on a peace officer. The charges were dismissed, online court records show, and the case is closed.

Brennand had been on the force for seven months and was still on probation, a standard practice for San Antonio officers who graduated from the police academy less than a year ago.

""The former Officer’s actions are indefensible and do not align with our training, tactics and procedures,"" Chief William McManus said. ""As such, I terminated him. I will withhold further comment as this incident is still under investigation.""

All police shootings are sent to the district attorney's office for review. Brennand has not been charged with a crime.

Danny Diaz, president of the San Antonio Police Officers’ Association, said he will refrain from commenting until an investigation is completed."

Carlton Funderburke, the senior pastor at Church at the Well, issued an apology video Tuesday for the ""inexcusable"" remarks he made in an Aug. 7 sermon.

""Though there is context behind the content of the clip, no context will suffice to explain the hurt and anguish caused by my words. I've spoken to those I am accountable to and have received their correction and instruction,"" he said. ""I have also privately apologized to our church, who has extended their love and support to me.""

In a video clip of his sermon posted on TikTok, Funderburke berates his church members for not ""honoring"" him with a Movado watch.

""This is how I know you’re still poor, broke, busted and disgusted, because of how you been honoring me. I’m not worth your McDonald’s money? I’m not worth your Red Lobster money? I ain’t worth your St. John Knits — y’all can’t afford nohow. I ain’t worth y'all Louis Vuitton? I ain’t worth your Prada? I’m not worth your Gucci?"" he said in the nearly minutelong clip.

At one point, Funderburke tells the congregation that a Movado watch can be bought at Sam's Club.

""And y'all know I asked for one last year. Here it is all the way in August and I still ain’t got it,"" he said. ""Y'all ain’t said nothing. Let me kick down the door and talk to my cheap sons and daughters.""

The video was posted by The Kansas City Defender, a digital media company. As of Wednesday, the video had been viewed more than 550,000 times.

Many people in the comments condemned Funderburke for preaching about material items.

""That would’ve been my last day in his church,"" a commenter wrote.

""I would’ve left so fast and loudly oh no sir,"" another said.

Another wrote: ""I missed the scripture about the mavado watch.""

Funderburke said Tuesday that his comments do ""not reflect my heart or my sentiments toward God's people.""

""Yet, that's not discernable in the clip,"" he said in his apology. ""Therefore, I offer this sincere apology to you today. No context could erase the words I used."""

Right-wing evangelical pastor, Jesse Duplantis, claims that Jesus has not yet returned because people are not donating enough money to churches.

During a recent four-day live TV event entitled Victorython, Duplantis claimed that people are not being generous enough to churches, hence why Jesus has not returned from the dead. He says:

“I honestly believe this — the reason why Jesus hasn’t come is because people are not giving the way God told them to give, when you understand this, you can speed up the time.”

He continued to suggest that if people called the number at the bottom of the screen, “God the Father would say ‘Jesus, go get ‘em.’” He continues:

I realized that I will not move people emotionally to give. I’m gonna have people move according to the word of God. What is God saying to you?

It can be assumed that no one donated enough as the BBC is yet to report the messiah returning from the grave.

People online have been quick to criticise Duplantis, with one writing:

“Can you believe this crap? How can people be so lost and not understand that you don’t have to fund the lives of Pathetic People like these? Do not listen to these Evil Men! They are what is wrong with this world. This is what the Bible says to avoid, is ministers like these!!” wrote another.

Another reverend tweeted: “How is this legal? Saying that viewers can “speed up the return of Christ by donating” should 100% count as false advertising, right?”

Exxon is mining bitcoin in North Dakota as part of its plan to slash emissions,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/26/exxon-mining-bitcoin-with-crusoe-energy-in-north-dakota-bakken-region.html,nottheonion,"A view of the Exxon Mobil refinery in Baytown, Texas. Jessica Rinaldi | Reuters

ExxonMobil , the top oil and gas producer in the U.S., is piloting a project to mine bitcoin in North Dakota, according to people with knowledge of the matter. For over a year, Exxon has been working with Crusoe Energy Systems, a company based in Denver, said the people who asked not to be named because details of the project are confidential. Crusoe's technology helps oil companies turn wasted energy, or flare gas, into a useful resource. Similar to ConocoPhillips ' mining scheme in North Dakota's Bakken region, Exxon is diverting natural gas that would otherwise be burned off into generators, which convert the gas into electricity used to power shipping containers full of thousands of bitcoin miners. Exxon launched the pilot in late January 2021 and expanded its buildout in July. While Exxon hasn't talked publicly about its work in the space, Eric Obrock, a 10-year veteran at the company, said on his LinkedIn profile that from February 2019 to January 2022, he ""proposed and led the first successful commercial and technical demonstration of using Bitcoin Proof-of-Work mining as a viable alternative to natural gas flaring in the oil patch."" Obrock's title on his profile is NGL industry outlook advisor, referring to the natural gas liquids market. Obrock told CNBC through a LinkedIn message that he's been advised that he can't speak to the media on this topic. Exxon didn't respond to a request for comment. Exxon's bitcoin project isn't really about making money from the cryptocurrency. Rather, the company has pledged to reduce emissions as part of an industrywide effort to meet higher environmental demands. In early March, Exxon joined other oil companies in committing to the World Bank's ""Zero Routine Flaring by 2030"" initiative introduced in 2015. The type of crypto mining arrangement it's pursuing with Crusoe reduces CO2-equivalent emissions by about 63% compared with continued flaring. Exxon's bitcoin mining work in North Dakota was first reported by Bloomberg, which said the company is also considering similar pilots in Alaska, the Qua Iboe Terminal in Nigeria, Argentina's Vaca Muerta shale field, Guyana and Germany.

Mining bitcoin in the Bakken

The problem Exxon and Conoco are addressing has existed for years: What happens when drillers accidentally hit a natural gas formation? Unlike oil, which can be trucked out to a remote destination, gas delivery requires a pipeline. If a drilling site is close to a pipeline, producers can sell it right away. But if the pipe is full or if the gas is 20 miles away, drillers often burn it off. That's why you typically see flames rising from oil fields. In addition to the environmental hazards, drillers are also burning cash. Enter bitcoin mining, which only requires an internet connection and can be done from anywhere. And because miners' primary variable cost is energy, they're incentivized to find the cheapest sources of power. ""This is just a great way to bring that demand to the wasted energy and solve two problems at once,"" said Cully Cavness, president of Crusoe, whose backers include Valor Equity Partners, one of Tesla 's largest investors. ""Solve the energy appetite of bitcoin and solve the stranded energy, flare gas problem for the energy industry."" Cavness said Crusoe has 150 employees and works with Norway's Equinor ASA , Canadian oil producer Enerplus and Devon Energy , based in Oklahoma City.

Permits from North Dakota's Division of Air Quality show Crusoe can run 20 portable engines, with 11 currently in use at well sites across the state. Two of the engines are operational at wells run by XTO Energy, Exxon's oil and gas fracking subsidiary, at the Jorgenson Deep Creek Site. Cavness said most of Crusoe's 80-plus data centers are deployed in the Bakken. ""We're really moving the needle on flared volumes,"" Cavness said. ""More than 10 million cubic feet of gas per day that would be flared is not flared because we've deployed our systems."" The World Bank, in its most recent Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership report, recognized Crusoe as offering an innovative solution to flaring.

Solving the methane problem

The Bakken formation became an important source of new oil production in the U.S. in the last couple decades with the boom in hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. Craig Thorstenson has been working at the permitting program at North Dakota's Division of Air Quality since 1989. He says North Dakota has always been an oil state to some extent, but growth in the Bakken lifted the state to second in the country, before it slipped to third last year. Thorstenson, who was born and raised in Bismarck, the state capital, said the change ""was quite a shock for us."" Residential housing couldn't keep up with demand. ""We were having a population boom,"" Thorstenson said. ""People coming in, wanting to get jobs. People living in the Walmart parking lots."" More drilling meant more wasted gas, which affected the entire Williston Basin that spreads across part of Montana, the Dakotas and into Canada. That's a big reason why Crusoe invested heavily in the area. ""At points in not-that-distant history, the basin was flaring almost up to a fifth of the gas that was being produced there,"" said Cavness. Thorstenson said the amount of wasted natural gas is finally trending lower. In a March report, North Dakota's Department of Natural Resources estimated that currently 93% to 94% of natural gas is being captured. In 2014, the commission had a capture goal of 74%. Drillers have historically chosen flaring as a way to dispose of excess gas because it's less damaging to the environment than venting, which releases methane directly into the air and produces greenhouse effects that have proven to be 84 to 86 times as powerful as CO2 over a 20-year period. Even with flaring, some methane does escape due to wind and other factors. On-site bitcoin mining can be especially impactful, because 100% of the methane is combusted and none of it leaks or vents into the air, according to Adam Ortolf, who runs business development in the U.S. for Upstream Data, a company that manufactures and supplies portable mining solutions for oil and gas facilities. ""Nobody will run it through a generator unless they can make money, because generators cost money to acquire and maintain,"" Ortolf said. ""So unless it's economically sustainable, producers won't internally combust the gas."" Crusoe's systems are built to make the process financially viable for drillers. The company brings its equipment onto the oil pad, allowing it to convert otherwise wasted natural gas into electricity, which then powers computing at the well site. ""When we put it through our generator, we get up to 99.9% combustion of that methane,"" Cavness said. ""Not only are we using the otherwise wasted energy, we're also significantly reducing methane emissions."" Cavness said his main takeaway from the United Nations' latest global climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, was that methane is the low-hanging fruit. ""That's the thing we want to solve as an energy industry,"" he said. WATCH: Texas crypto miners power down to ease grid pressure"

Ron DeSantis sends two planes of illegal immigrants to Martha's Vineyard,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ron-desantis-sends-two-planes-illegal-immigrants-marthas-vineyard,nottheonion,"EXCLUSIVE: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis followed through on his promise to drop off illegal immigrants in progressive states, sending two planes full of migrants to Martha’s Vineyard on Wednesday.

A video provided to Fox News Digital shows the migrants deboarding the planes at Martha’s Vineyard Airport in Massachusetts.

""Yes, Florida can confirm the two planes with illegal immigrants that arrived in Martha’s Vineyard today were part of the state’s relocation program to transport illegal immigrants to sanctuary destinations,"" the governor’s communications director, Taryn Fenske, told Fox News Digital.

FLORIDA GOV. DESANTIS SAYS FUNDS ARE IN PLACE TO BUS ILLEGAL MIGRANTS OUT OF HIS STATE

""States like Massachusetts, New York and California will better facilitate the care of these individuals who they have invited into our country by incentivizing illegal immigration through their designation as ‘sanctuary states’ and support for the Biden administration’s open border policies,"" she said.

""As you may know, in this past legislative session the Florida legislature appropriated $12 million to implement a program to facilitate the transport of illegal immigrants from this state consistent with federal law,"" she said, later adding that the state's ""immigration relocation program targets both human smugglers found in the state, but also preempts others from coming to Florida.""

The office of Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker responded to an after-hours email from Fox News Digital, saying it was aware of the situation and that the arrivals were provided short-term shelter.

""The Baker-Polito Administration is in touch with local officials regarding the arrival of migrants in Martha’s Vineyard,"" Terry MacCormack, Baker's press secretary, wrote. ""At this time, short-term shelter services are being provided by local officials, and the Administration will continue to support those efforts.""

Fox News Digital reported in April that Florida’s budget since approved by the state legislature included $12 million for the Florida Department of Transportation to remove illegal immigrants from the state and relocate them.

Martha's Vineyard is famously known as a playground of rich progressives, including former President Barack Obama, who bought a multimillion-dollar house there in 2019.

DeSantis, a Republican, proposed Delaware or Martha’s Vineyard as a destination for such migrants, but his office explained at the time that they could also be sent ""to other 'progressive' states whose governors endorse blatant violations of federal immigration law.""

TEXAS GOV. GREG ABBOTT DIRECTS USE OF BUSES TO DROP OFF MIGRANTS AT STEPS OF CAPITOL IN DC

""It is not the responsibility of Floridians to subsidize aliens to reside in our state unlawfully; we did not consent to Biden’s open-borders agenda,"" the governor’s office said at the time.

In November, DeSantis said dozens of migrant flights landed in Florida at the behest of the Biden administration, and he threatened at that time to send them to Delaware on buses.

Meanwhile, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, began sending thousands of illegal immigrants to Washington, D.C., in April as the migrant crisis overwhelmed border states. In August, buses from Texas started heading to New York City and Chicago. Arizona has also sent buses to Washington.

Vice President Kamala Harris, who was put in charge of tackling the border crisis by President Biden shortly after they assumed office in 2021, sparked a firestorm this week after she twice declared the U.S. southern border is ""secure"" while administration officials estimate an average of 55,000 so-called ""gotaways"" each month — illegal immigrants who successfully make it into the country without being detained.

Driverless car appears to flee the scene after being pulled over by cops,https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/04/cops-take-dim-view-of-autonomous-vehicle-driving-with-no-lights-at-night/,nottheonion,"A video showing a driverless car being stopped by the police and then attempting to drive away went viral over the weekend. San Francisco police stopped one of Cruise's autonomous Chevrolet Bolt EVs, likely because the car's headlights were not on despite it being night. In the video, first posted to Instagram on April 2, an officer can be heard saying, ""There's nobody in it.""

But a few seconds later, after the officer walks back to his police car, the autonomous vehicle—perhaps deciding that the traffic stop was over—tries to drive away before pulling over to a stop a few hundred feet away.

Cruise says that the car wasn't trying to make a run for it. The vehicle first yielded to the police vehicle, then pulled over to a safe spot for the actual traffic stop, the company says. One of the police officers contacted Cruise to inform it of the situation, and the driverless car did not receive a ticket. Cruise says it has fixed whatever caused the car to drive without its headlights at night.

This is not the first time that a driverless car has been stopped by the police. Way back in 2015, when it was still just the Google Self-Driving Car Project and not Waymo, a Google self-driving car was stopped in Mountain View, California, for going just 24 mph (39 km/h) in a 35 mph (56 km/h) zone. On that occasion, no ticket was issued, as the officer decided that no law had been broken.

In 2019, a police officer in Providence, Rhode Island, pulled over one of May Mobility's low-speed autonomous shuttles. The six-person shuttles run a 12-stop urban loop to and from a train station, but on the first day of operations, one was stopped by an officer who was unfamiliar with the vehicle. No charges resulted from that interaction, either.

Also in 2019, a driverless Tesla was stopped after its owner used the car's remote summon feature in Florida. However, in that case, the incident was staged by a YouTuber.

Autonomous vehicle developers like Cruise and Waymo have prepared guides for first responders on how to interact with the vehicles in case of emergencies."

After two years of travel disruption, summer holidays are back on people’s minds with many of us planning trips abroad.

This has resulted in mayhem at some airports as soaring passenger numbers combined with staff shortages has resulted in long queues.

One airport in Spain has been accused of giving Irish passengers “preferential treatment” with an “express lane” by some British passport holders, as they have no choice but to watch on from a separate queue.

Travellers have been sharing pictures from Malaga Airport which has sectioned off into two separate passport queues. One is sealed off with black tape and signposted with a union jack for ‘all passengers’. The other is enclosed with green tape and shows an Irish tricolour and EU flag while labelled for ‘EU citizens’.

Since Brexit, British tourists are only allowed to stay in the Schengen area (a free movement area without border controls that includes 26 countries including Spain but excluding Ireland) for 90 out of 180 days and must get their passports stamped when they leave or could face being refused entry on another visit.

Meanwhile Irish citizens benefit from EU-wide passenger rights for travel into, out of, or within the EU by air, rail, bus/coach or ship.

Sharing a picture of the scene inside Malaga Airport, Twitter user @winding_sios wrote: ""The express bus lane (green tape) with the automated turnstiles is for Irish EU citizens. The Disneyland queue (black tape) with the police toll booths is for non-EU citizens.""

One British passenger claimed Irish citizens are getting “preferential treatment"" while others reported ""two hour queues for non-EU passengers"".

A Twitter user said: ""Sitting in Malaga Airport to return. What a joke! A huge queue for UK passengers stretching all the way back to duty free exit…whilst the lane for EU empty.""

“Preferential treatment for the one flight to Ireland. Travellers beware,” another added.

A third wrote: ""Queues for passport control are ridiculous. Allow an extra hour after security for the passport control.""

It comes as up to 3,000 passengers missed their flights at Madrid Airport over the Easter break, according to local media, with fears those scenes could be repeated over the Summer holidays.

President of Airlines Association (ALA) in Spain Javier Gandara said: “There have already been problems at the airports over Easter and we need to avoid this happening in peak season.”

He has called for National Police officers to be put on duty in Spanish airports to check passports, particularly British ones.

“It will be the first summer when passports for travellers to the UK have to be checked and the first when air traffic is likely to be normal, now that the British government has lifted all the restrictions imposed because of the pandemic,” he added.

"Utah mom selling almost 4,000 ounces of breast milk as baby formula shortage continues",https://www.fox13now.com/news/local-news/utah-mom-selling-almost-4-000-ounces-of-breast-milk-as-baby-formula-shortage-continues,nottheonion,"TOOELE, Utah — Alyssa Chitti has three freezers full of breastmilk.

“I figure I'm running out of room, so might as well help someone else,"" she said laughing. “I know I have over 3,000 ounces. 3,000 ounces downstairs and probably almost 1,000 upstairs.”

At first, she wanted to donate it all to a local milk bank, but it was much easier to list it online.

“I have looked into it,"" said Chitti. ""I was working with a group on it, but my daughter has SMA, and we've been in and out of primaries, and so it's just been hard to go do the bloodwork and go do all the other stuff, and that's the only thing that stopped me from doing that part.”

READ: Utah moms help each other find baby formula as shortage sweeps the nation

Mountain West Mothers' Milk Bank would need more than 300 donors to meet the needs in the community. During this donor shortage, they’ve gotten down to 175. Even if hundreds of women volunteered to donate today, it would still take months for the bank to meet the demand, said Mary Callahan, the milk bank's clinical coordinator.

“The donor screening process, because we are very thorough and it does require blood tests, on average, it takes about four to six weeks,"" Callahan said. ""We do have donors that are motivated that can get it done in two. It would probably take us two to three months to really get to where we can start looking at providing for the outward community that's outside of the hospital.”

Chitti was hoping to sell her breast milk at $1 per ounce, but she’s willing to negotiate with moms because she understands what they’re going through, she said.

“It was making me nervous, just because so my daughter was very, very colicky,"" said Chitti. ""And I know a lot of moms need specific formulas for babies with upset tummies, and I know how hard it can be when they're upset. There's nothing you can do about that stomach pain.”

Days after the FOX 13 News story aired, Chitty began receiving negative feedback about her decision, which led her to stop selling the breast milk.

Buying and selling breast milk online is perfectly legal; however, it is unregulated. When human milk is obtained directly from individuals or through the internet, the donor is unlikely to have been screened for infectious diseases or contamination risk, according to the FDA.

The Mountain West Mothers' Milk Bank shared a statement on the process the group uses to donate breast milk.

""Our goal is for human milk donation to be a smooth and easy process for anyone choosing to make this incredible gift. We partner with 20+ sites across Utah and Southern Idaho where donors can complete blood work and drop off milk, and are adding more regularly. We will work directly with individuals who may not have access to one of our traditional sites. The other steps can be completed from home.

""We do not want to discourage anyone from donating, no matter when they choose to begin the process. The time it takes from first contact with MWMMB to making the first donation is highly variable, and we are bringing on extra staff to help with the increased response from our communities. Once we receive the milk, we can process it and send it back to hospitals within about 10 days.

""And, we don't just need donor milk today, we need milk to consistently come into the Milk Bank. Hospitals use Pasteurized Donor Milk throughout the year.. We can use donated milk for several months after it is donated, so that we can continue to provide this critical medical nutrition source for the tiniest members of our community."""
Backlash grows over decision to scrap Victorian hospital’s Indigenous name in favour of Queen Elizabeth II,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/sep/19/backlash-grows-over-decision-to-scrap-victorian-hospitals-indigenous-name-in-favour-of-queen-elizabeth-ii,nottheonion,"Victoria’s First Peoples’ Assembly has accused the Andrews government of making a hospital in Melbourne’s east “culturally unsafe” for Indigenous Australians after it vowed to rename the site in honour of Queen Elizabeth II, dumping its Indigenous name.

In a pre-election pledge on Sunday, Victoria’s premier, Daniel Andrews, promised to rebuild the Maroondah hospital, in East Ringwood, at a cost of $1bn and rename it to pay tribute to the Queen.

The renaming has sparked a backlash from some Indigenous leaders and others but Andrews on Monday defended the decision and said it was a “fitting” tribute.

Marcus Stewart, co-chair of the First Peoples’ Assembly – the body elected to develop the state’s Indigenous treaty framework – criticised the decision.

“With just a few words the government has turned the Maroondah hospital into a culturally unsafe place for our people,’” he said.

“This is a stark reminder of why treaty is so critical, it can put an end to the hurtful platitudes of the powerful.”

On Twitter, federal Greens senator for Victoria, Lidia Thorpe, who in 2017 became the first Indigenous woman elected to the state’s parliament, labelled the decision an “insult”.

“This is not what treaty looks like, Dan,” she wrote.

“Maroondah is a Woiwurrung word meaning leaf, which symbolises Maroondah’s green environment. What an insult to now colonise us, again.”

According to the Maroondah council website, Maroondah is an Indigenous word that means “throwing leaves”.

More than 2,000 people have signed a petition on change.org criticising the renaming since the government’s decision was announced yesterday.

Maroondah Hospital is the only hospital I can think of in Victoria with an Aboriginal name. Inclusive healthcare starts from the signage on.



The funding and expansion is much needed, but I hope such a beloved and inclusive name can remain. https://t.co/afVOY9eNea — Dr Neela Janakiramanan (@NeelaJan) September 18, 2022

Speaking to reporters on Monday, the day of Queen Elizabeth’s funeral, Andrews argued the local council would retain the name “Maroondah” but it was fitting to rename the hospital.

“It’s a new hospital – a brand-new hospital and it needs a new name. On this day, of all days, it’s appropriate to commemorate a life of duty and service,” he said.

Andrews said the renaming would have “no impact” on the work Victoria was doing on developing a treaty framework. Victoria is the only jurisdiction in Australia to have enacted the treaty and truth-telling components of the 2017 Uluru Statement from the Heart – with the federal government committing to act on both. The first Victorian treaties could be signed next year.

But Thorpe said the state government could not “pick and choose what treaty is.”

“You can’t pull treaty out when it’s convenient or politically advantageous for yourself. Treaty is about everything we do in this state and in this country,” she told Guardian Australia.

“Treaty is peace for our people, our land, our water.”

Asked if the government consulted or flagged the name change with the local Indigenous community, Andrews said he did not know if there was consultation when the hospital was first named.

“If you or any other Victorian wants to have a look at our record when it comes to First Nations issues, then I’d invite you to do that,” he said.

'Maroondah' is a Woiwurrung word that means 'throwing' and 'Maroon' means 'leaves'.



What is Labor thinking changing the name of a hospital from an Aboriginal word to the name of a foreign monarch representing colonisation?



This is not what decolonisation looks like. — Samantha Ratnam - Leader of the Victorian Greens (@SamanthaRatnam) September 19, 2022

“We’ve made the announcements we’ve made and that’s what we’ll push on and get done.”

Queen Elizabeth II has hospitals named after her in Brisbane and Adelaide, along with a medical centre in Perth.

The government’s plan for the hospital – which would accommodate an extra 9,000 inpatients a year – came a day after Victoria’s opposition had promised a $400m upgrade if it won the election in November.

"Boris Johnson ‘not a complete clown’, says his new press chief",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/07/boris-johnson-not-a-complete-clown-says-guto-harri-new-press-chief,nottheonion,"Boris Johnson is “not a complete clown”, his new communications director has said, as he revealed that the prime minister initiated a defiant rendition of Gloria Gaynor’s I Will Survive when the pair met last week.

Days after being appointed No 10’s chief spin doctor after a clearout of aides over the “partygate” scandal, Guto Harri said the government would be more “focused on delivery” with a beefed-up team of staff who were more experienced and less ideological.

Speaking to Golwg.360 in comments translated from Welsh to English, Harri then recounted the conversation that led to his hire, saying: “Although I haven’t seen him in person for years, we picked up where we left things, in terms of the tone of our friendship. I walked in, I saluted to the PM and said: ‘Prime minister, Guto Harri reporting for duty.’

“He stood up from behind his desk and started to take the salute but he said: ‘What am I doing? I should take the knee for you.’ The two of us laughed. Then I asked: ‘Are you going to survive, Boris?’ And he said in his deep voice – slow and purposeful – starting to sing a little while finishing the sentence and saying: ‘I will survive.’

“I inevitably invited him to say: ‘You’ve got all your life to live,’ and he replied: ‘I’ve got all my love to give,’ so we had a little blast from Gloria Gaynor. No one expects that, but that’s how it was.”

Harri said there was “a lot of laughing” and the pair had “a serious conversation about how we get the government back on track and how we move forward”.

He added: “Everyone’s focus has been on recent events that have caused a lot of hurt, but in the end, that’s nothing to do with the way people voted two years ago. He’s not a complete clown, but he’s a very likable character … He is not a vicious man as some misrepresent him.”

Angela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader, responded by questioning the seriousness of Johnson and his new hire. “Did I mention that there are no serious people left to serve? They think it’s all just one big joke, don’t they?” she said. On Sunday, Harri had said he was joining a “grownup” and “pragmatic” operation.

Downing Street would not comment on the interview, with Johnson’s official spokesperson saying he would “not get into private conversations” that the prime minister had with Harri. He also said there was no conflict in the role with Harri’s previous work for Hawthorn Advisers, a lobbying firm founded by the Tory co-chair Ben Elliot that counts the Chinese tech firm Huawei as a client.

“He provided advice to the clients of a private company. That is entirely legitimate and we would not exclude from government someone with valuable experience and expertise. Our position on Huawei is clear. We have strict controls on how Huawei is currently deployed,” the spokesperson said.

While it is rare for senior advisers to make public comments, Harri also broke cover over the weekend to tackle Dominic Cummings – a former No 10 adviser who has been deeply critical of Johnson – on Twitter.

Harri revealed he was called in to see Johnson at 5pm on Friday, 24 hours after it was announced that Jack Doyle had resigned as communications director. Doyle is understood to have been at a Downing Street Christmas party on 18 December, and previously offered his resignation, though it was rejected.

Harri’s appointment follows the news that Steve Barclay, the Cabinet Office minister and chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, will fill the No 10 chief of staff role vacated by Dan Rosenfield at the end of last week.

The prime minister is expected to distribute some of Barclay’s Cabinet Office portfolio to other ministers this week, and may conduct a mini-reshuffle, particularly of the whips’ office. He is also set to appoint a new top civil servant to oversee the office of the prime minister, but this may not happen until next week."

WTVG obtained a Toledo police report stating Christopher Antron Scott Jr. was trying to show his girlfriend, 36-year-old Anna Sigarroa, how to use a handgun while at home.

The report states Sigarroa had recently purchased the firearm.

Sigarroa told police she wanted Scott to put the weapon down because he wasn’t allowed to be around guns due to a prior felony conviction.

When Scott refused, police said Sigarroa tried to take the gun away, and the struggle led to the gun going off and Scott being shot in the mouth.

Sigarroa was booked into Lucas County Jail and was charged with felonious assault.

Stranded dog saved from drowning after rescuers attach sausage to drone,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/20/stranded-dog-saved-from-drowning-after-rescuers-attach-sausage-to-drone,nottheonion,"As the tide rose, it began to look perilous for Millie the jack russell-whippet cross, who had defied the efforts of police, firefighters and coastguards to pluck her from treacherous mudflats.

So the rescuers had to think imaginatively, and came up with the idea of attaching a sausage to a drone and hoping the scent of the treat would tempt Millie to safety. It worked gloriously and Millie has been reunited with her grateful owner after following the dangling sausage to higher, safer ground.

Millie disappeared after slipping her lead in Havant, Hampshire, and after frantic public appeals was spotted on the mudflats, in danger of being engulfed by the tide. She resisted efforts to encourage her to a safer spot until a drone pilot suggested attaching food to one of the unmanned aerial vehicles that had been used to track the dog.

“It was a crazy idea,” said Chris Taylor, the chair of the Denmead Drone Search and Rescue team. But they pressed ahead and after checking Civil Aviation Authority regulations, and the MTOW [maximum takeoff weight] of their machines, the rescuers calculated they could attach a single sausage to a drone.

Taylor said: “One of the local residents on the beach where we were flying from supplied us with the sausages – I think they were from Aldi. The woman cooked them up for us and we attached them with string.”

To the joy of the rescuers, Millie took the bait.

“If we hadn’t had got her away from that area the tide would have come in and she would have been at risk of drowning,” said Taylor. “It was something we had never tried before – the sausages were the last resort, as we couldn’t reach her by kayak or any other means.

“Because Millie was hungry it worked at luring her away from the danger to higher ground, which wouldn’t go underwater. We certainly would consider using sausages again: every dog and search operation is always going to be different, but if we were ever in a similar situation again we would employ the same methods to lure the dog.”

Though the sausage worked, skittish Millie raced off again but was finally reunited with her owner, Emma Oakes, after being spotted inland from the marsh. She ran towards Oakes’s father, Tony, and jumped into his arms.

Emma Oakes, a care manager, said: “Relief just poured over me. It was just absolutely fantastic to have her home.

“Millie really likes food and she’ll eat anything you give her … raw carrots, cucumber – but she much prefers sausages. Meat is her favourite food, so dangling a sausage was probably the best thing they could lure her with.

“Millie’s a rescue dog so she’s quite timid. She loves being at home more than anything and now she’s back all she’s doing is sleeping. She just sleeps and eats and looks at you as if to say: ‘I’m resting, leave me alone.’”"
More than 100 students baptized without parents’ permission at North Carolina school,https://thehill.com/homenews/3629996-more-than-100-students-baptized-without-parents-permission-at-north-carolina-school/,nottheonion,"FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. (WGHP) — A North Carolina school apologized after baptizing more than 100 children without their parent’s permission, according to the Fayetteville Observer.

Northwood Temple Academy, a private Christian school in Fayetteville, posted on Facebook on Thursday, “I feel it in my bones, You’re about to move! Today we had over 100 middle and high school students spontaneously declare their faith and get baptized today. We will have more pictures of these powerful moments posted over the next couple of days!”

That morning, three students had their scheduled baptisms at the school as part of Spiritual Emphasis Week. The offer was then extended to other students who had not been scheduled. More than 100 students in total were baptized.

Renee McLamb, the head of the school, sent families a letter to explain.

“The Spirit of the Lord moved and the invitation to accept the Lord and be baptized was given and the students just began to respond to the presence of the Lord,” McLamb said in the letter, which was obtained by the Observer.

The school says it typically notifies and invites parents to be present for any baptisms that happen on campus, and “it was not the intention of any faculty member to do anything behind a parent’s back or in any kind of secret way.”

“I do understand that parents would desire to be a part of something so wonderful happening in the lives of their children, and so I apologize that we did not take that into consideration in that moment,” McLamb said. “I pray that at the end of the day we will all rejoice because God truly did a work in the lives of our students.”

McLamb told the paper that the school should have given students a chance to contact parents and ask permission. “We were not expecting such an overwhelming response to the message that was spoken, but as a mother I certainly can empathize with why some parents were upset,” she said.

McLamb said that most of the parents that contacted her were glad, but some were unhappy with the move. Some of the children had already been baptized, and at least one family was concerned that a second baptism could undo the first."

OAKLAND, Calif. (KGO) -- Employees dressed as Power Rangers at a new restaurant in the East Bay sprang into action and became real superheroes by saving a woman who was being attacked. The whole incident was documented in a now-viral series of Tweets by a woman who was having dinner.

As if the sight of a 90s superhero taking orders or slinging drinks at a bar wasn't amazing enough, what happened at Noka Ramen in Oakland around 8 p.m. on Friday could be described as ""morphin' time!""

""When something surprising breaks out, you're not sure it's real,"" said Ploi Pirapokin via Zoom.

According to her Twitter thread, which has hundreds of thousands of impressions, everyone seemed to jump into action to de-escalate the situation.

""All of the servers, slash Power Rangers were moving towards the scene to help one another out,"" Pirapokin said.

She says in her tweets the man even started using racial slurs. But then the spirit of community kicked in and even the customers, started ""morphin'.""

""The patrons started getting involved in a way that was supporting and making sure everyone was safe,"" Pirapokin said.

She says the Power Rangers ended up piling onto the man and police showed up. Oakland police confirm to ABC7 News they detained the man, believing he was undergoing a mental health crisis, and transported him for medical attention.

Pirapokin, who is Thai herself, says what she witnessed was an example of that fun, Thai spirit and the need to help others coming to life.

""Thai people are very playful. We like to laugh. Whether it's to create harmony or balance, that's our ethos. That's how we approach something that's scary or shocking or surprising. It's something within us that we turn to laughter to try and peacekeeper right away,"" said Pirapokin.

While the costumes -- which are an ode to the restaurant's signature cocktails served in ranger-shaped vessels -- are only worn on Fridays, they're a reminder that it's always morphin' time at Noka.

As they say in the famous show: ""May the power protect you.""

As the restaurant reviews surveillance footage of the incident, Pirapokin says the restaurant wants to make sure the community understands the workers are not vigilantes but are ready to assist anyone in need of help. This was just an isolated incident.

"2 months after NJ legalized recreational marijuana, Hunterdon Co. Sheriff says there’s concern in law enforcement community about use by officers",https://www.wfmz.com/news/area/western-newjersey/2-months-after-nj-legalized-recreational-marijuana-hunterdon-co-sheriff-says-there-s-concern-in/article_8b4725b8-f1a6-11ec-8256-83e5b0c7f750.html,nottheonion,"FLEMINGTON, N.J. - Tuesday marked two months since recreational marijuana was legalized in New Jersey, but there's still a lot of confusion about how it impacts law enforcement. One county sheriff is calling on lawmakers to clarify, so officers don't end up losing their jobs.

The main issue is a lack of accurate testing to show if an officer is still under the influence, or if he or she just has a remainder of THC left in the bloodstream.

""All police are concerned about it,” said Hunterdon County Sheriff Frederick W. Brown.

Brown is talking about what he considers loopholes in New Jersey's law that legalized recreational marijuana.

""There's a lot of issues about this, you know, the legalization, which I don't think were thought out when the legislation passed,” said Brown.

Brown, who has been sheriff for 12 years and was chief of the Raritan Township Police Department before that, is calling on lawmakers to pass a bill that clarifies how the law enforcement community should handle marijuana among officers.

He personally wants to exclude officers from being able to use it.

""The other side of that would be to remove marijuana as one of the tested drugs, and then we wouldn’t know, unless somebody was showing signs that they were under the influence,” said Brown.

“All police have to undergo random drug testing, and it still covers marijuana. I would hate to have an officer get jammed up for doing something that the Attorney General said is okay, but on our part of it, it isn't okay.""

The sheriff says state leaders shouldn't be waiting for an issue to arise to address this, and that it impacts both officers and the communities they serve.

""You figure if you're involved in a serious accident, or even a shooting, they very well may want to do a drug test on the officer, and it would come up that he had marijuana in his system, it could really make a difficult case,” said Brown. “We don't want any officer to be the test case in this.""

He's not the only one who feels this way.

""The state PBA actually put out a notice,” said Brown. “I just had a State Sheriff's meeting last week, and it was brought up at that.""

Gov. Phil Murphy has said he would be open to a legislative fix.

There are a few bills in the works to limit marijuana use among certain industries, including law enforcement, though none have completed the legislative process.

""It just needs to be straightened out,” said Brown.

69 News reached out to the Attorney General's Office about this Tuesday but did not hear back at the time of this report."
Police discovered illegal orgy between 70 people because two assistants went to the wrong house,https://24happenings.com/top-world/48570.html,nottheonion,"Drivers who hit pedestrians may in some cases be right in their actions, and in this case the blame rests entirely on the pedestrian, reports the news agency DEITA.RU.

According to RG, about 32,000 attacks on pedestrians took place in Russia this year, one third of which is the fault of the pedestrians themselves. In addition, the publication emphasizes that pedestrians have priority on pedestrian zones and crossings. In other cases, drivers have the right of way if the road is not marked and there are no appropriate signs.

In such cases, pedestrians risk their lives, which means that they can get under the wheels of a car. Drivers are often required to pay for the victim’s treatment or funeral, although there are exceptions to this practice.

So, in the northern capital, the driver Sergey hit a pedestrian. The investigation and the court of first instance found him guilty and ordered him to pay moral damages to the victim’s sister. The driver did not agree with this decision and filed a complaint. The court of the second instance took into account the arguments of the driver, canceled the sentence and sent it for consideration. As a result, the court acquitted the driver and also rejected the claim for moral damages."

Uvalde mother says police are harassing her after she saved kids from shooting,https://globalnews.ca/news/8957137/uvalde-school-shooting-police-harassment/,nottheonion,"Send this page to someone via email

A mother who bravely entered Uvalde, Texas’ Robb Elementary School to save her children says she is now being harassed by local police officers.

Angeli Rose Gomez told San Antonio News 4 that she took matters into her own hands during last month’s school shooting massacre that left 19 children and two adults dead.

Gomez said she rushed to the school when she heard an active shooter was on the property. She could hear gunshots and children screaming as she came face-to-face with officers standing outside the school doors. The officers told her she could not enter the school and momentarily put her in handcuffs as she tried to enter the school.

After convincing them that she would calm down they released her from the cuffs, she said.

That’s when she saw an opportunity. She told the news outlet she jumped a nearby fence and began banging on a door window, motioning to her eldest son’s teacher, who she could see inside the school.

Gomez told her, “You already have a gateway out, so you might as well just come out. Like if I’m going to run out with him, y’all just come on too.”

Once inside the building she was able to collect her oldest son and some of his classmates, ushering them out of the school. She then went back to the door of her youngest son’s classroom.

“At this moment, I’m jiggling the handle and I’m going pretty nuts like trying to get the door open and it’s not gonna open, so I stand back and the cops are already on me and they’re like, ‘Ma’am, calm down!'” she recounted to KATU News.

She said she told police she wouldn’t leave the hallway until they began evacuating the classroom.

“Immediately, they start evacuating that classroom and my son runs out to me and he’s like, ‘Mom, mom!'”

Since the harrowing incident, her lawyer says Gomez has been the target of harassment and hostility by some of the officers on the Uvalde force.

“As far as we know there’s two definite instances,” Mark Di Carlo told HuffPost, saying his client was recently pulled over at a traffic stop and falsely accused of having illegal immigrants in her car. Di Carlo says police also parked outside her home for 45 minutes and flashed their car lights at her and her mother when they went for a walk.

Uvalde’s officers have been the subject of much criticism for how they conducted themselves on the day of the shooting. Texas’s public safety Chief Steve McCraw said officers waited more than 70 minutes before storming the school and killing the shooter — something he described as an “abject failure.”

“Three minutes after the subject entered the west building, there was a sufficient number of armed officers wearing body armour to isolate, distract and neutralize the subject,” McCraw said during a Texas senate committee hearing last week, pointing much of the blame at school district police Chief Pete Arredondo.

“The officers had weapons, the children had none. The officers had body armour, the children had none. The officers had training, the subject had none,” McCraw said.

“One hour, 14 minutes and eight seconds — that is how long the children waited, and the teachers waited, in Room 111 to be rescued.”

The May 24 attack at Robb Elementary School is the deadliest school shooting in the U.S. in nearly a decade, and for three days police offered a confusing and sometimes contradictory timeline that drew public anger and frustration.

Authorities now acknowledge that students and teachers repeatedly begged 911 operators for help while the police chief told more than a dozen officers to wait in a hallway. Officials said he believed that the suspect was barricaded inside adjoining classrooms and that there was no longer an active attack.

The chief’s decision — and the officers’ apparent willingness to follow his directives against established active-shooter protocols — prompted questions about whether more lives were lost because officers did not act faster to stop the gunman, and who should be held responsible.

Di Carlo told HuffPost he wrote to the Uvalde Police Department about what happened, but has not received a response. The police have not publicly commented about Gomez’s allegations.

An emotional Gomez told CBS News she thinks the officers’ delayed response cost innocent children their lives.

“They could have saved many more lives,” Gomez said in an interview earlier this month. “They could have gone into the classroom, and maybe two or three would have been gone, but they could have saved the whole, more, the whole class. They could have done something — gone through the window, sniped him through the window. Something, but nothing was being done.”

Last week, the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District’s Superintendent Hal Harrell confirmed that Arredondo has been put on administrative leave, citing still-unanswered questions about what happened that day.

“From the beginning of this horrible event, I shared that the district would wait until the investigation was complete before making personnel decisions,” Harrell said. “Because of the lack of clarity that remains and the unknown timing of when I will receive the results of the investigations, I have made the decision to place Chief Arredondo on administrative leave effective on this date.”

"Euphoria glamorizes drugs says D.A.R.E., a failed program that glamorized drugs",https://consequence.net/2022/01/euphoria-glamorizes-drugs-d-a-r-e/,nottheonion,"Representatives of Drug and Alcohol Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.) have issued a statement accusing HBO’s Euphoria of glamorizing drugs. And they’re something of an expert on the subject, since D.A.R.E. led to a massive increase in drug use among students subjected to their program.

The soapy HBO drama follows a motley group of teens, led by Zendaya, who chase various highs while navigating the pitfalls of high school. Season 2 is ongoing, and drugs remains a key plot point; in the first episode of the new series, Zendaya’s character overdoses on one drug, and then uses a second drug to stop herself from dying. Creator Sam Levinson based the series in part on his own youthful addiction, and sought to capture something “raw and honest,” in the series’ source material, an Israeli miniseries of the same name.

But that’s far too much honesty for some. In a statement to TMZ, a D.A.R.E. rep said, “Rather than further each parent’s desire to keep their children safe from the potentially horrific consequences of drug abuse and other high-risk behavior, HBO’s television drama, Euphoria, chooses to misguidedly glorify and erroneously depict high school student drug use, addiction, anonymous sex, violence, and other destructive behaviors as common and widespread in today’s world.”

It would be quite a feat if Euphoria managed to do half as much damage as D.A.R.E. The program that popularized “Just say no,” was introduced into elementary schools in 1983, starting with police officers teaching fifth graders about a wide variety of intoxicants. Soon it was expanded to high schools. By 1992 the first results began to trickle in. A study at Indiana University found that D.A.R.E. grads were significantly more likely to use hallucinogens than kids who didn’t learn about hallucinogens in 5th grade — imagine that!

As science writer Natalie Wolchover summed up, “Every subsequent study on the effectiveness of D.A.R.E., including a major 10-year investigation by the American Psychological Association, found much the same result. The program doesn’t work, and in fact is counterproductive, leading to higher drug use among high school students who went through it compared to students who did not.”

D.A.R.E. kept chasing the “Just say no” dragon until 1998, when it finally lost federal funding. But it’s still in existence today, occasionally emerging from its den of virtue to issue a firm scolding. As for Euphoria, it’s a massive hit, setting records for HBO Max while consistently trotting out one of the trendiest, most expensive soundtracks in television history. The full series soundtrack drops February 25th, and we named the first single, Lana Del Rey’s “Watercolor Eyes,” our Song of the Week. Episode 4 will air this Sunday, January 30th."
Meta dissolves team responsible for discovering 'potential harms to society' in its own products,https://slatereport.com/tech/meta-dissolves-team-responsible-for-discovering-potential-harms-to-society-in-its-own-products/,nottheonion,"Some members of the “Responsible Innovation” team are moving to other groups at the company.

Meta’s “Responsible Innovation Team,” a group meant to address “potential harms to society” caused by Facebook’s products, is no more. The Wall Street Journal reports that the team was recently “disbanded” though “most” members will stay on with other teams at the company. A Meta spokesperson told The Wall Street Journal the company was “committed to the team’s goals,” but didn’t provide a reason for the change in strategy.

The Responsible Innovation team was first formed “several years ago,” according to a 2021 blog post written by Meta’s Margaret Stewart, the Facebook VP who oversaw the team. The team was made up of engineers as well as people with backgrounds in civil rights and ethics, and advised the company’s product teams on “potential harms across a broad spectrum of societal issues and dilemmas,” she wrote last year.

Couple lives aboard cruise ships after calculating it makes more ‘financial sense’ than a mortgage,https://7news.com.au/lifestyle/couple-live-aboard-cruise-ships-after-calculating-it-makes-more-financial-sense-than-a-mortgage-c-6678207,nottheonion,"Angelyn Burk has been in love with the open sea since she first embarked on a cruise in 1992.

So when she married fellow seafarer Richard, the couple planned annual - if not bi-annual - cruises around the globe.

“We really enjoy cruising and being able to visit different parts of the world without hopping on an airplane,” Angelyn tells 7Life.

After crunching the numbers, the couple, in their 50s, realised they could live the rest of their lives hopping from cruise ship to cruise ship - for as little as $A62 each a day.

Fifty-three-year-old Angelyn, an accountant, figured they could live their dream lifestyle thanks to a combination of savings and the anticipated sale of their home, in the US city of Seattle.

So they quit their jobs and, leaving behind their yet-to-be-sold bricks and mortar, sailed into the sunset.

Enjoying the life of seafaring nomads since May 2021, they are now well accustomed to their sea legs.

And they’re sharing their tips on how you, too, can retire on the sea.

Open water

In early 2021, as the couple began to think about retirement, they dreamt of setting sail and never stepping foot on land again.

“Our original plan was to stay in different countries for a month at a time and eventually retire to cruise ships as we got older,” Angelyn says.

“We love to travel and we were searching for a way to continuously travel in our retirement that made financial sense.”

The couple have travelled by cruise ship to more than ten countries. Credit: Supplied

Angelyn began to calculate the exact age at which they could afford to be on the high seas for good.

She discovered that by using their loyalty memberships, and taking advantage of sales, they could actually retire at that very moment - and it made more financial sense than a mortgage.

“We have been frugal all our lives to save and invest in order to achieve our goal,” she says.

“We are not into materialistic things but experiences.”

Angelyn says Singapore has been one of her favourite locations so far. Credit: Supplied

Leaving their nine-to-five existence - and the bills that came with it - they headed out onto the open ocean in May 2021, with just one suitcase each.

“We don’t plan to permanently live on land in the future,” Angelyn says, adding that they can count on one hand the number of times they have slept on terra firma in the past year.

All aboard

Since their departure, they have meticulously planned where each cruise would finish and the next begin.

On the rare occasion the ships’ timelines haven’t matched up, the couple spends a short time on land, often with family or friends.

From 50 days around the Adriatic Sea, seeing the sights around Europe, to a mega 51-day trip from Seattle to Sydney, the couple plans to visit every corner of the globe.

Singapore, Italy, Canada, Iceland and the Bahamas are just a few of the Burks’ favourite destinations - all of which they have reached totally by ship.

They have visited some countries numerous times but still enjoy it, and say Singapore has so far been the standout.

And they say they’ve secured accommodation, food, beverages and all transport for an average of just $A62 per person per night.

Retired at 53, Angelyn believes anyone can follow in her footsteps. Credit: Supplied

“I believe this is achievable for the everyday cruiser, but it does take effort,” Angelyn says.

“It is leisurely travel without the complications of booking hotels, restaurants and transportation, while staying within our budget.”

The couple sees no drawbacks to living at sea, but Angelyn cautions that anyone who wants to set sail should try long-term cruises before making it permanent.

According to The Associated Press, police in the town of Monte Escobedo confirmed the incident, which occurred Wednesday.

Citing a “law enforcement official who was not authorized to be quoted by name,” the AP reported that the head and other body parts had been left in an ATM booth.

The Miami Herald reported that a person in the video can be heard saying, “Lleva una cabeza humana este perro,” which translates to “This dog has a human head.”

The video posted showed the dog trotting down a dark street and holding the head by the neck in its jaws, the AP reported.

Police eventually were able to wrest the head away from the dog, according to the AP and Mexican news outlet Aristegui Noticias.

The Herald reported that a person had reported finding the head at the ATM, along with a backpack and bloodied notes, according to El Sol de Zacatecas. The ATM is located yards from an official government building, the newspaper reported.

The human remains were left with a message about a drug cartel, according to the AP.

The town, located in the state of Zacatecas, has been the scene of a violent turf war between local gangs backed by the Sinaloa and Jalisco drug cartels, the news organization reported.

According to CBS News, the U.S. Department of Justice considers the Jalisco cartel to be “one of the five most dangerous transnational criminal organizations in the world.” The cartel’s leader, Nemesio Oseguera, is known as “El Mencho” and is among the most sought-after drug lords by Mexican and U.S. authorities."
Georgia death row inmate allowed to ask for firing squad instead of 'painful' lethal injection,https://news.sky.com/story/georgia-death-row-inmate-allowed-to-ask-for-firing-squad-instead-of-painful-lethal-injection-12639582,nottheonion,"A man on death row in the US has won the right to challenge whether he is given a lethal injection.

Michael Nance, 61, would rather die in front of a firing squad - but it is not an approved method of execution in the state of Georgia.

Now, the US Supreme Court has said he can challenge Georgia's execution protocol under federal civil rights.

Nance, who was sentenced to death in 2002 after being convicted of murder, argued that a lethal injection would cause undue pain and suffering.

According to court documents, his veins are ""severely compromised and unsuitable for sustained intravenous access"".

He also claimed there was a risk that the sedative used in lethal injections in Georgia would not render him unconscious because of long-term use of a prescription drug to treat back pain.

Firing squad is used for executions in four states - Mississippi, Oklahoma, Utah and South Carolina, according to the Death Penalty Information Centre.

In addition to lethal injection, there are three other methods: electrocution, lethal gas and hanging.

An injection is the most common one, with 31 states favouring it.

McDonald’s is releasing new Happy Meals for adults to recreate ‘one of the most nostalgic experiences’,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/29/mcdonalds-is-rolling-out-a-nostalgic-new-happy-meal-for-adults.html,nottheonion,"You're never too old for a Happy Meal, or at least that's what McDonald's is banking on.

The fast food juggernaut this week announced plans to introduce adult-oriented meals — complete with a free toy — in an initiative designed to work off of the nostalgia of the restaurant's famous red cardboard boxes.

The Cactus Plant Flea Market Box is a collaboration between McDonald's and the famous streetwear brand, and will roll out to participating stores starting on Oct. 3.

Unlike the smaller menu items included in the classic Happy Meal, the Cactus Plant Flea Market Box will feature either a Big Mac or a 10-piece Chicken McNuggets, as well as a soda and fries.

Inside the box will also be ""one of four collectible figurines"" of McDonald's mascots Grimace, the Hamburglar and Birdie, as well as a Cactus Buddy.

""We're taking one of the most nostalgic McDonald's experiences and literally repackaging it in a new way that's hyper-relevant for our adult fans,"" McDonald's chief marketing officer Tariq Hassan said in a statement.

This is far from McDonald's first foray into branded partnerships.

The chain made waves last April when it teamed up with K-pop superstars BTS as part of its Famous Orders campaign.

In 2020 it released a combo inspired by rapper Travis Scott's favorite order, and it was so popular that it caused some restaurants to run out of Quarter Pounder burgers, CNBC reported at the time.

In addition to the combo meal, McDonald's and Cactus Plant Flea Market will also be releasing a limited-edition line of clothing and merchandise.

Fans who don't want the meal but are interested in buying the clothing will be able to access the collab's website on Monday morning at 11 a.m. ET.

SOUTHLAKE, Texas (KTRK) -- A parent in north Texas tested the ""In God We Trust"" sign law for Texas schools.

The state passed a law in 2021 that says public schools must display signs featuring the national motto if the signs are received as donations from a private entity or purchased with donated money.

SB 797, which applies to schools, universities, and the like, states the sign must be displayed in a conspicuous place, has to be framed or on durable poster board, and must include an American flag.

Mexican man donates kidney to girlfriend's mother; gets dumped a month later as she marries someone else,https://www.freepressjournal.in/viral/mexican-man-donates-kidney-to-girlfriends-mother-gets-dumped-a-month-later-as-she-marries-someone-else,nottheonion,"Screen grab/ You Tube

We have come across many stories of people going to extreme lengths and sacrificing their all for the sake of love, but most of these, unfortunately, aren't lucky enough to have a fairy-tale ending.

Take an example of this man's misfortune. Uziel Martínez, from Mexico, has claimed that he donated a kidney to his girlfriend's mother - but was ditched less than a month later.

The story of Martínez, who works as a teacher, has gone viral on social media after he revealed his unfortunate love affair as part of a TikTok trend.

In a series of video, he explained how he generously helped save his lady love's mother by donating an organ. But little did Martínez know that even such a heroic act would not be enough to make his relationship work and that it would eventually get over within weeks of the transplant.

To add to his heartbreak, Martínez's former girlfriend has now married another man. ""I donated a kidney to her mother, she left me and got married a month later,"" he said.

The video has been doing rounds on TikTok and has attracted over 14 million views, according to Daily Star.

One person commented: ""Don’t look so sad, she lost a great gentleman. Keep moving forward and find the perfect woman who appreciates you.""

In follow-up videos, Martínez responded to comments on his viral post, saying he was doing fine and didn't hold any grudges against his ex-girlfriend.

He said he was healthy, despite being left with only one kidney and was past the heartbreak.

“I don’t have anything against her … we’re not friends but we don’t hate each other. I only made [the video] for TikTok, I didn’t think it would get out of control,” he said, referring to the video’s crazy popularity.

Channel 5 honors Queen Elizabeth's funeral with a somber screening of The Emoji Movie,https://www.avclub.com/channel-5-emoji-movie-queen-elizabeth-ii-funeral-1849552551,nottheonion,"It’s often said that the best way to honor the memory of a loved one is not by dwelling in despair, but by living on as they would’ve wanted. It’s harder to say whether Britain’s Channel 5 considers the recently deceased Queen Elizabeth II as a close loved one. But if so, the broadcaster has found an especially unique means to carry on amidst a mass outpouring of emotion over t he Queen’s death.

While every other British channel paused their regularly scheduled programming on Monday to screen Her Majesty’s funeral, Channel 5 concocted their own tribute: a screening of The Emoji Movie. Yes, The Emoji Movie, a film Jordan Peele once said convinced him to quit acting sheerly based on an offer to star in it. This is a film that, in his review for The A.V. Club, Vadim Rizov describes as “Inside Out crossed with a Sony commercial and dunked in toxic ooze.” This is a film where Patrick Stewart plays a poop emoji...O.K., you get the point.

Channel 5, per Entertainment Weekly, was the only major U.K. broadcaster not screening the service, save for a documentary on Her Majesty that Channel 4 aired in the funeral’s stead. After The Emoji Movie concluded, Channel 5 also showed children’s favorites Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs and Sing. An attempt at counter-programming makes some sense, but given that even X-rated British channels with names like “babes&brazzers” relegated their usual lineups, a major broadcaster forgoing coverage altogether is irregular.

Adding to the irregularity of the whole scenario, of course, is the overt randomness of The Emoji Movie for the Queen’s Memoriam (at least play Paddington 2!) However, this is actually not the first time a whole country has awarded the film a special place in their history. In 2018, Saudi Arabia lifted a 35-year ban on movie theaters with a screening of the same film. Clearly, the two countries’ governments (also primary trading partners to each other) deal in cinematic taste as well as goods."
US tourist injured falling into Mount Vesuvius crater after taking selfie,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/11/us-tourist-injured-falling-mount-vesuvius-crater,nottheonion,"An American tourist sustained minor injuries after he fell into the crater of Mount Vesuvius as he scrambled to retrieve his phone.

The 23-year-old and his family reached the 1,281m-high (4,202ft) summit of the volcano towering over the southern Italian city of Naples after bypassing a visitor turnstile and proceeding along an out-of-bounds path.

The man was taking a selfie, according to local press reports, when his phone slipped out of his hand and into the mouth of the volcano. He then descended into the crater in an attempt to get his phone back, only to fall several metres after losing his balance.

Vesuvius guides were first on the scene and abseiled into the crater to pull him out. Police attended the scene and a mountain rescue helicopter was launched to assist the rescue operation.

The man was treated for cuts and bruises on his arms and back.

The tourist and his three relatives face charges after being reported by police for the invasion of public land. The group, which reportedly ventured to the volcano without any tickets, took a path that was clearly signposted as being forbidden due to being extremely dangerous.

In September 2017 an 11-year-old boy and his parents died after falling into the crater of Solfatara di Pozzuoli, one of 40 volcanoes in the Campi Flegrei area west of Naples. The boy was believed to have fainted due to gas fumes before falling into the crater. His parents tried to save him but the crater collapsed.

Vesuvius, which destroyed the ancient Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum when it erupted in AD79, is considered to be among the most dangerous volcanoes in the world due to its proximity to Naples and other nearby towns."
Texas Gov. Abbott: Rape victims can prevent pregnancy by taking Plan B,https://wreg.com/news/nation-and-world/texas-gov-abbott-rape-victims-can-prevent-pregnancy-by-taking-plan-b/,nottheonion,"This is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.

(The Hill/NEXSTAR) — Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) said rape victims in the state can prevent pregnancies by using emergency contraception pills such as Plan B, The Dallas Morning News reported Friday.

In Texas, abortions are banned. There are no exceptions for rape or incest.

Late last month, a so-called “trigger law” went into effect following the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade earlier this year. The trigger law makes it a felony to perform an abortion in the state, with narrow exceptions when the pregnant person’s life is at risk.

“We want to support those victims, but also those victims can access health care immediately, as well as to report it,” Abbott told The Dallas Morning News and KXAS-TV’s “Lone Star Politics” in a segment obtained by the Morning News that will air on Sunday.

“By accessing health care immediately, they can get the Plan B pill that can prevent a pregnancy from occurring in the first place,” he added.

Plan B is an oral contraceptive that is taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex or a “contraceptive accident” to prevent pregnancy, according to the product’s website. The pill prevents an egg from being released from the ovary to prohibit fertilization.

The Republican governor also told “Lone Star Politics” that reporting a rape to law enforcement “will ensure that the rapist will be arrested and prosecuted.”

However, very few rape cases result in an arrest. While there were 13,327 reported rapes in Texas in 2020, there were only 1,828 arrests for rape, according to the state’s department of public safety.

Abbott’s Democratic opponent Beto O’Rourke responded to the governor’s statement on Twitter on Friday night, saying “We are going to end Greg Abbott’s career on November 8 and the women of Texas are going to lead the way.”

The Texas governor made national headlines just shy of a year ago for comments made after the implementation of State Bill 8, which was at that time the most restrictive abortion bill in the U.S. Under SB 8 — now superseded by the trigger law — abortions were banned after about six weeks, which is earlier than many people even realize they are pregnant.

During a press conference on the bill, Abbott was asked whether or not the bill was cruel to victims of rape. Abbott responded that the bill still gave victims six weeks to get an abortion, so it does not force victims to have their assaulter’s child.

Instead, Abbott posed a different solution to the issue of rape, saying, “Let’s be clear: rape is a crime. And Texas will work tirelessly to make sure that we eliminate all rapists from the streets of Texas by aggressively going out and arresting them and prosecuting them and getting them off the streets.”

The comments were widely panned by detractors and advocates for victims of sexual violence.

Abbott, who has served as Texas governor since 2015, will face O’Rourke in November’s election. The former state representative has been a fierce critic of Abbott’s policies, particularly his handling of the state’s electrical management and gun regulations in the wake of the deadly mass shooting in Uvalde.

In recent months, Abbott has focused much of his attention on migrants at the Texas-Mexico border, which has included headline-grabbing bussing of migrants to sanctuary cities like Washington, D.C. and Chicago."
Man released from California prison after 38 years following DNA test,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/oct/29/man-released-from-california-prison-after-38-years-after-dna-test,nottheonion,"A man who spent more than 38 years behind bars for a 1983 murder and two attempted murders has been released from a California prison after long-untested DNA evidence pointed to a different person, the Los Angeles county district attorney said.

The conviction of Maurice Hastings, 69, and a life sentence were vacated during a 20 October court hearing at the request of prosecutors and his lawyers from the Los Angeles Innocence Project at California State University.

“I prayed for many years that this day would come,” Hastings said at a news conference on Friday. “I am not pointing fingers. I am not standing up here a bitter man, but I just want to enjoy my life now while I have it.”

The district attorney, George Gascón, said in a statement: “What has happened to Mr Hastings is a terrible injustice. The justice system is not perfect, and when we learn of new evidence which causes us to lose confidence in a conviction, it is our obligation to act swiftly.”

The victim in the case, Roberta Wydermyer, was sexually assaulted and killed by a single gunshot to the head, authorities said. Her body was found in the trunk of her vehicle in the Los Angeles suburb of Inglewood.

Hastings was charged with special-circumstance murder and the district attorney’s office sought the death penalty but the jury deadlocked. A second jury convicted him and he was sentenced in 1988 to life in prison without parole.

Hastings has maintained his innocence since he was arrested.

At the time of the victim’s autopsy, the coroner conducted a sexual assault examination and semen was detected in an oral swab, the district attorney’s statement said.

Hastings sought DNA testing in 2000 but the DA’s office denied the request. Hastings submitted a claim of innocence to the DA’s Conviction Integrity Unit last year and DNA testing last June found that the semen was not his.

The DNA profile was put into a state database this month and matched that of a person convicted of an armed kidnapping in which a female victim was placed in a vehicle’s trunk, as well as the forced oral copulation of a woman.

That suspect, whose name was not released, died in prison in 2020.

The district attorney’s office said it was working with police to further investigate the involvement of the dead person in the case.

Texas butterfly park shuts down after QAnon theorists call it a sex trafficking hub,https://meaww.com/national-butterfly-center-texas-shut-qanon-rally-border-security-theory,nottheonion,"The National Butterfly Center in Mission, Texas has been forced to close between January 28 and 30 2022, thanks to a deluge of QAnon followers. In an email blast to members, the Centre said it had received "" credible threats"" from a ""former state official"" as far-right groups gather a short while away in McAllen for a 'We Stand for America' rally. Located less than a mile from the US-Mexico border, the center has become the latest battleground of the group's bizarre conspiracy theories.

In 2020, Marjorie Taylor Greene became the first QAnon supporter to be elected to the US Congress. Since then, the group has only gained more traction. On March 2, 2021, a small group of believers thronged to Washington DC believing that Trump would be sworn in as President on that date. In November, a large group of believers warned the AT&T Discovery Plaza in Dallas, claiming JFK Jr. would return and give a speech.

Now, the National Butterfly Centre has become the latest attraction for believers, thanks in part to its location. Even though its nowhere near the McAllen rally, the center believes it will be swarmed by followers to see drug and human traffickers with their own eyes.

Why is the center closed?

Between January 28 to 30, a 'We Stand for America' rally will take place in McAllen, which will feature many notable conspiracy theorists like General Michael Flynn, singer Ted Nugent, QAnon promoter Mel K, and “Stop the Steal” advocate Rep. Mark Finchem to name just a few. The rally will focus on border law enforcement, and as part of the event will feature a ""rolling car protest on the border"".

That protest is expected to make a stop at the Mission center because it is located just minutes away from the Rio Grande, which theorists claim is a hotbed for drug and human trafficking. In its email, the center said, ""We were alerted to this event following a visit by a congressional candidate from Virginia."" The unnamed candidate reportedly demanded access to the center so they could see the illegal crossing taking place from the center's property. That interaction led to police getting involved after the center claimed the candidate knocked an employee to the ground and stole her phone.

There has never been any proof that the center supports or even helps migrants cross into the US, but nonetheless, its location has made it a prime target for theorists. In the past, it has been attacked by Steve Bannon and Brian Kolfage, founder of the 'We Build The Wall movement. Kolfage had once even shared fake photos of rafts at a dock outside the center, claiming they were used by smugglers, The Daily Dot reported. It appears the Virginia candidate used those attacks as well in her altercation with the center.

Following the incident, the center was advised to close by a former state official, who told employees to either be ""armed at all times or out of town this weekend,"" because it was a definite target. The center claimed that it was already being attacked and that someone ""ripped down the National Butterfly Center sign"". So far, the Mission Police Department has not confirmed whether it would file a case against the candidate, or investigate who took down the center's sign.

""We still cannot believe we are at the center of this maelstrom of malevolence rising in the United States,"" the center said. It called on people to share the story, as well as support the center through donations because of the strain imposed by the pandemic."
"Delta Air Lines offered $10,000 to passengers willing to give up their seat on overbooked domestic flight",https://www.chron.com/life/travel/article/Delta-Air-Lines-offered-10-000-to-passengers-17279222.php,nottheonion,"Passengers aboard a recent Delta Air Lines flight departing Gerald R. Ford International Airport in Grand Rapids, Michigan were treated to a tempting offer: $10,000 for getting off the plane.

Inc. magazine's Jason Aten wrote a personal account of the event, which he claims took place aboard a connecting flight he and his family had boarded for Minneapolis. According to Aten, the carrier announced the flight had been oversold and that eight volunteers stood to receive $10,000 each in cash or electronic payment should they be willing to give up their seats on the plane.

""If you have Apple Pay, you'll even have the money right now,"" a flight attendant said, according to Aten.

""We did not take it for reasons I'm not going to get into because my wife is still not pleased about it,"" he wrote.

Todd McCrumb, another passenger aboard the plane, has since corroborated Aten's story regarding the outsized offer. McCrumb told Fortune's Christine Mui that the carrier had initially offered $5,000 to passengers before bumping the figure to $7,500 and eventually $10,000 when volunteers failed to materialize.

""Unfortunately, my wife has some health issues and cannot travel alone,"" McCrumb told Mui. ""She would not bump [because] she was anxious to be home, for health issues and some other concerns. I couldn’t abandon her for any amount of [money].""

A Delta spokesperson refused to confirm or deny the $10,000 cash offer, according to Mui.

""The ability to provide compensation empowers our employees to take care of our customers and get our aircraft out on time,"" the representative stated.

While remarkable, the high figure offered to Aten and others falls within the parameters of possible compensation the airline has approved for passengers giving up their seats. In 2017, CNBC's Everett Rosenfeld published a leaked internal Delta bulletin in which the carrier announced it would increase its payment cap for voluntary denied boardings from $1,350 to $9,950. The document stated that higher-figure offers would come with certain rules and requirements, including an authorization from flight staff superiors.

The leaked memo encouraged attendants to ""start at a lower compensation and increase, if necessary.""

After canceling hundreds of flights over the previous week, Delta Air Lines on Sunday announced a temporary fare change waiver ahead of Fourth of July weekend. The carrier is allowing passengers with airfare booked during the busy travel window to change their reservations for free in anticipation of ""potentially challenging"" operational obstacles over the holiday weekend.

""Delta people are working around the clock to rebuild Delta's operation while making it as resilient as possible to minimize the effects of disruptions,"" the carrier wrote in a statement. ""Even so, some operational challenges are expected this holiday weekend."""
St. Louis preparing to sue Hyundai and Kia over rampant car thefts in the city,https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/st-louis-preparing-sue-hyundai-kia-rampant-car-thefts-city,nottheonion,"Car thefts have skyrocketed in St. Louis in recent months, with city leadership threatening lawsuits against Kia and Hyundai for an alleged defect that makes certain makes of the cars easier to steal.

""Our drivers probably get about five of these things a day. Just Kias and Hyundais getting stolen,"" tow truck driver Mark Hartmann told KMOV last week of thefts in the city.

Auto thefts in St. Louis have doubled this year, according to KMOV. In July alone, the city averaged about 21 Kia and Hyundai theft incidents each day. That number increased to 23 thefts each day in August, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch previously reported.

In August, St. Louis leaders threatened to sue Hyundai and Kia, demanding the car companies address a defect that allegedly makes stealing vehicles made before 2021 easier to steal. KMOV reported last week that plans to sue the carmakers over the city's spike in auto thefts are still in the works.

NEW ORLEANS BECOMES MURDER CAPITAL OF AMERICA, OVERTAKING ST. LOUIS

""With this letter, the city demands that Kia and Hyundai mitigate the defective conditions providing thieves – including teenagers as young as 13 – the instrumentalities by which they are destroying property, endangering city drivers and themselves, and, in some cases, committing violent felonies,"" according to the letter written Aug. 19 by City Counselor Sheena Hamilton.

Hyundai is Kia’s parent company, but the two automakers operate independently.

""Another stolen recovery we got,"" Hartmann added to KMOV of picking up the remains of a stolen car in the city. ""It’s good for business but it’s bad for a lot of things. Customers are out of their car for weeks.""

A spokesperson for St. Louis Mayor Tishaura Jones did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment on the planned lawsuits.

Hyundai Motor America spokesperson Ira Gabriel told Fox News Digital this week that the company ""received the letter from the City of St. Louis and provided a formal response.""

""Our vehicles are not defective and comply with all applicable safety regulations. Notwithstanding this, we have been working cooperatively with the St. Louis Police Department and the police departments in other communities to provide our assistance in responding to these thefts. We have provided the St. Louis Police Department and police departments elsewhere with steering wheel locks so that they can distribute them to our customers affected by these criminal acts. We continue looking for meaningful ways to support law enforcement efforts,"" he continued. Gabriel also noted that a security kit that helps shield cars from the thefts is available at Hyundai dealers and authorized installers.

Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt pushed back against St. Louis leaders' plans to sue the automakers over the crimes in August.

""St. Louis has a violent crime problem. What’s causing crime in the city? The Mayor’s war against the police? The prosecutor letting criminals run wild? Evidently city ‘leaders’ think it’s….the cars. Yes—car manufacturers are to blame not criminals You can’t make this stuff up,"" he tweeted on Aug. 30.

POLICE SAY TIKTOK-LED KIA, HYUNDAI CAR THEFTS INCREASING ACROSS THE COUNTRY AS LAWSUITS MOUNT

St. Louis was considered the murder capital of the United States but was unseated this year by New Orleans. As of Sept. 17, St. Louis recorded 45 homicides per 100,000 residents compared to New Orleans' 52 homicides per 100,000 residents as of Sept. 11.

Thefts of Kias and Hyundais have skyrocketed across the country in recent months, as a TikTok challenge using the hashtag ""Kia Boys"" grew in popularity. The social media trend challenged people to steal certain models of Kias and Hyundais made between 2010-2021 that are not equipped with an electric anti-theft security device called an immobilizer. The cars can be stolen with just a USB cable and a screwdriver, according to the social media trend.

TIKTOK CAR THEFT CHALLENGE: CHICAGO AREA SEES 767% INCREASE IN HYUNDAI, KIA THEFTS

""Kia and Hyundai’s defective vehicles have caused a public safety crisis in the city, endangering the health, safety, and peace of all those who live, work or visit the city,"" Hamilton continued in the letter to the car companies. ""Your companies bear the responsibility to mitigate the public nuisance your negligence has created for the city and its residents.""

The car companies have also faced a handful of class action lawsuits filed this year over the vehicles not having immobilizers.

A law firm in Ohio reported last week that more than 3,600 people in the state have inquired about joining the proposed suit. Another class action suit was filed in California last month against the car companies over the vehicles lacking immobilizers. A similar class action suit was filed in Illinois at the beginning of September, and another one was filed in Minnesota later that same month.

HYUNDAIS AND KIAS STOLEN NEARLY TWICE AS OFTEN AS OTHER VEHICLES, NATIONAL STUDY FINDS

Hyundai Motor America spokesperson Gabriel added in the statement to Fox News Digital that the company remains ""concerned about the increase in thefts of certain Hyundai vehicles that have been targeted in a coordinated social media campaign."" Hyundai also provides steering wheel locks to police departments in areas seeing an increase in the thefts, and is developing software to further prevent the crimes in addition to releasing a glass break sensor security kit available at dealerships and approved installers.

""All Hyundai vehicles meet or exceed Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. Some earlier models, without a push-button ignition, do not have engine immobilizers. In November 2021, engine immobilizers became standard on all Hyundai vehicles produced,"" Gabriel said.

A representative for Kia America also told Fox News Digital later Sunday that the company is ""is concerned with the rise in vehicle thefts.""

""While no car can be made completely theft-proof, criminals are targeting vehicles equipped with a steel key and ""turn-to-start"" ignition system as opposed to those equipped with a key fob and ""push-button to-start"" system. Kia America continues to work closely with local law enforcement in affected areas to provide steering wheel lock devices at no cost to concerned owners of steel key operated Kia vehicles not originally equipped with an immobilizer,"" the statement states.

""All 2022 models and trims have an immobilizer applied either at the beginning of the year or as a running change, and all Kia vehicles meet or exceed Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards."" The company is also testing software updates to ""further secure these targeted vehicles and will share more information as it becomes available."""
Arizona moves to ban land purchases by Chinese communists,https://tucson.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/arizona-moves-to-ban-land-purchases-by-chinese-communists/article_0a53ed40-9014-11ec-be4a-4bda0626e6de.html,nottheonion,"PHOENIX — Republican lawmakers have voted to send a message to Chinese communists: Your money is not welcome here — at least not for buying land.

On a party-line vote Wednesday the Senate Commerce Committee approved legislation making it illegal for the Chinese Communist Party to own property in Arizona. That part of SB 1342 appeared to get no opposition.

But the proposal by Sen. Wendy Rogers, R-Flagstaff, seeks to extend the same prohibition to any individual who is a member of the Chinese Communist Party. And that drew questions about who in fact is a member of the party and whether such restrictions are appropriate against individuals based solely on that status.

Rogers provided the committee with no specifics about what is the problem here — or even if there is one. Nor did she know whether members of the CCP own land in Arizona.

Instead she simply read from information that was provided after U.S. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, introduced similar federal legislation last year.

Roy said in a news release that a Chinese-based energy company bought more than 130,000 acres of land near Laughlin Air Force Base in his home state “and is now attempting to build a wind farm to access the U.S. power grid.”

At Wednesday’s hearing, the measure got a boost from P.M. Azinga, a Mesa resident who said she taught in China for five years.

“The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fight,” she said, quoting from the ancient Chinese military treatise by Sun Tzu.

That rang a bell with Sen. Sonny Borrelli, R-Lake Havasu City, who is a retired service member and called himself “a student of Sun Tzu.” What that philosophy involves, Borrelli said, is “encroachment, either through purchase, or their grab a little, nudge a little, grab a little, nudge a little.”

But who, then, is a member of the Chinese Communist Party?

Sen. David Livingston, R-Peoria, compared it to being an active duty member of the military who is deployed and representing the country.

“It’s so different from how we think,” he said. “Trust me: This is not the Republican Party or the Boy Scouts.”

And Sen.Tyler Pace, R-Mesa, said the State Department has a list of who belongs.

That still left Sen. Michelle Ugenti-Rita, R-Scottsdale, a bit uneasy with the wording. She questioned the wisdom of restricting individual land ownership based on that party affiliation.

Pace also questioned what, if anything, might attract Chinese interest.

“Other than Sedona, I don’t know what else they would want to buy,” Pace said.

On a national level there has been discussion about Chinese interests controlling farmland, with the most recent data putting that at about 190,000 acres according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, though complex company ownership structures may make that figure unreliable.

Still, that is far less than many other countries, USDA data as of 2019 showing more than 7.4 million acres of U.S. land owned by Canadian companies, 4.5 million by firms from the Netherlands and nearly 2.5 million by Italian interests.

Borrelli suggested that the measure, approved by the panel on a 5-3 vote, still needs work before it goes to the full Senate.

One issue, he said, would be banning ownership only of “strategic” properties. And Rogers said she’s willing to narrow the scope.

But here, too, the definition of what that includes could prove difficult, with even former Vice President Mike Pence saying in a speech last year that should include farmland.

One thing Rogers did make clear: Her only concern is Communists — as in members of the CCP — from China. Those from other countries would remain free to spend their money and buy up what they want.

Rogers also made no mention of homegrown communists. And there appear to be at least a couple of dozen.

The official reports of the secretary of state’s details political affiliation only for those parties actually recognized, usually by virtue of their candidates getting enough votes in the most recent election.

But Arizonans remain free to self-identify on those voter registration forms.

A total of 30 people listed their affiliation as “Communist,” with another dozen listing their affiliation as “Communist Party USA” and six just as “Communist Party.”"

Jerry Seinfeld Apologizes For “Uncomfortable” Sexual Aspect In Bee Movie,https://www.romper.com/entertainment/jerry-seinfeld-apologize-bee-movie,nottheonion,"Jerry Seinfeld has issued an apology for an awkward aspect of Bee Movie some 14 years after it premiered in theaters. During an appearance on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon, Seinfeld acknowledged what viewers of Bee Movie have long known: there appeared to be subtle hints of a romantic or sexual relationship forming between the bee and the human who make up the film’s two main characters.

“I apologize for what seems to be a certain uncomfortable subtle sexual aspect of the Bee Movie, which really was not intentional,” Seinfeld said during a chat with late-night host Jimmy Fallon over the weekend. “After it came out, I realized, ‘This is really not appropriate for children.’”

Seinfeld went on to explain that although unintentional, certain aspects of both Bee Movie’s plot and the characters’ development made it appear as if an inappropriate relationship was forming between his character, a honey bee named Barry B. Benson, and Renée Zellweger’s character, a human woman named Vanessa Bloome.

“The bee seems to have a thing for the girl,” Seinfeld said of the animated movie. “We don’t really want to pursue that as an idea in children's entertainment.”

Seinfeld not only starred in Bee Movie, but was also one of the film’s writers and producers. Released by DreamWorks and Paramount Pictures in 2007, the film centers around Barry B. Benson’s adventures outside his hive after discovering a honey bee’s life is one of unending labor. While outside the hive, Barry meets Vanessa, a florist who saves Barry from being crushed to death by her human boyfriend who has a life-threatening allergy to bees.

Following his rescue, Barry begins to pal around with Vanessa. In fact, it is during one of these outings that Barry learns humans have been stealing honey from bees. It’s then that Vanessa ditches her human boyfriend and helps Barry take legal action against the human race, forcing all honey to be returned to bees.

While Barry and Vanessa’s relationship in The Bee Movie has been the joke of many a meme since the film’s release 14 years ago, the film’s team has long maintained that an interspecies romance was never considered as a plot point. In fact, Bee Movie director Steve Hickner once told The New Statesman that Barry and Vanessa’s relationship was “never going to be sexual or anything like that.”

“It was purely this friendship,” Hickner said. “Maybe in Barry's mind he thought… but it was never going to be that.”"
Florida Christian school teacher arrested after “twerking” on student,https://nbc-2.com/news/crime/2022/09/09/florida-christian-school-teacher-arrested-after-twerking-on-student/,nottheonion,"PERRY, Fla. – A former Florida Christian school teacher has been arrested for multiple incidents, including twerking on an underaged student.



According to authorities, Julie Hoover, 39, took part in the Point of Grace Christian School Prom on April 8th. During the event, Hoover began pressuring a student to drink an alcoholic beverage by forcing the straw from her cup into his mouth. A school administrator told investigators that staff had the alcohol in the back room to drink after the event, when students left.



The student would tell investigators that while he was on the dance floor, Hoover began to “twerk on him”, making him feel uncomfortable. At least two other people tried to get the teacher to stop, even getting between the two.



The prom incident was not Hoover’s time she had been arrested for misconduct.



According to Taylor County Deputies, Hoover was arrested for sexting an 18-year-old high school senior. The student’s mother found the messages on the teen’s phone, which included a plan for the student to sneak into Hoover’s home while her husband was at work.



Hoover has been charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor and soliciting or engaging in lewd conduct with a student."

The Walt Disney Company issued a statement of support for the LGBTQ+ community amid the backlash against Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” bill, supported by state politicians that the corporation has funded. But the company is still funding the homophobic politicians who’ve supported the bill, and nothing Disney CEO Bob Chapek has said indicates that that will change.

The Orlando Sentinel reported that Disney has given money to every single sponsor and co-sponsor of the “Don’t Say Gay” bill, which was passed by Florida’s House of Representatives February 24. Officially titled the House Bill 1557, the proposed law is heading to the state’s Republican-held Senate next.

As the Orlando Sentinel stated, the bill’s Senate sponsor, Ocala Republican Dennis Baxley, has actively backed anti-gay legislation for years, including laws that would block gay couples from adopting children.

Additionally, Baxley “once compared kids who live with same-sex parents to kids raised by alcoholics and abusers and later said, ‘I’m not phobic, but I simply can’t affirm homosexuality.'” The Walt Disney Company has allegedly donated to Baxley, among other bill supporters.

As of this publication, Disney will not stop funding Baxley and other Florida Republican politicians who support this bill. Instead Disney released this statement: “We understand how important this issue is to our LGBTQ+ employees and many others,” the Walt Disney Company stated, via Good Morning America. “For nearly a century, Disney has been a unifying force that brings people together. We are determined that it remains a place where everyone is treated with dignity and respect.”

The statement continues, “The biggest impact we can have in creating a more inclusive world is through the inspiring content we produce, the welcoming culture we create here, and the diverse community organizations we support, including those representing the LGBTQ+ community.”

President Biden called the bill “hateful,” tweeting, “I want every member of the LGBTQI+ community — especially the kids who will be impacted by this hateful bill — to know that you are loved and accepted just as you are. I have your back, and my Administration will continue to fight for the protections and safety you deserve.”

Former Disney chairman and CEO Bob Iger responded on Twitter, “I’m with the President on this! If passed, this bill will put vulnerable, young LGBTQ people in jeopardy.”

However, current Disney CEO Bob Chapek has yet to make a personal statement outside of the official Disney company address. Per a The Hollywood Reporter exposé, Chapek is “staunchly opposed to bringing Disney into issues he deems irrelevant to the company and its businesses,” according to a THR source.

AP

Latondra Newton, Disney’s chief diversity officer, sent a message to Disney’s 195,000 employees to discuss the “deeply troubling and heartbreaking” developments with the Florida bill, citing that Chapek had asked “to meet with leaders in our company’s LGBTQ+ community to discuss how Disney can best support these important and valued employees and cast members.”

The company is slated to host a “Reimagine Tomorrow” conversation on March 22 that will be dedicated to “issues of concern to our LGBTQ+ colleagues,” and partake in a company-wide “Reimagine Tomorrow Global Summit” on April 13 that will be “the first gathering of our employees worldwide to discuss our progress on and plans for improving diversity, equity and inclusion at Disney,” with Chapek participating.

Disney has 77,000 employees in Florida, where it operates both parks and cruises. Pre-COVID, Disney’s Parks, Experiences and Consumer Products division accounted for more than one-third of all company revenue.

Disney’s website states that the company is “a leader in LGBTQ workplace equality and content and is committed to inclusive workplaces, and supports welcoming environments in local communities.” The conglomerate has also donated to LGBTQ+ non-profits like the Human Rights Campaign, GLAAD, GLSEN, Trevor Project, and Outfest, among others. Disney started offering benefits to partners of LGBTQ+ employees in 1996 and launched the first Disney Pride group in 1999.

As for gay representation onscreen, Bill Condon’s live-action “Beauty and the Beast” is notable for featuring an “exclusively gay moment” between LeFou (Josh Gad) and Gaston (Luke Evans). Yet actor Gad later expressed “regret” over how the scene was labeled.

“It was never intended to be a moment that should laud ourselves for, because frankly, I don’t think we did justice to what a real gay character in a Disney film should be,” Gad told The Independent. “If we’re going to pat ourselves on the back, then damn it we should have gone further with that. We didn’t go far enough to warrant accolades. We didn’t go far enough to say, ‘Look how brave we are.’”

Gad added, “Everybody deserves an opportunity to see themselves on screen, and I don’t think we’ve done enough — and I certainly haven’t done enough to do that.”

Former CEO Iger previously spoke out about political issues, including threatening to cease production in Georgia if the state passed anti-abortion “heartbeat bill” in 2019 and President Trump’s Muslim ban legislation.

Iger and Chapek formerly co-signed a letter to employees in 2020 that read, “The recent killing of George Floyd as well as other instances of lethal attacks and harassment of unarmed Black citizens in our nation continue to drive outrage and calls for action by people of all cultural backgrounds, including many of our employees.” The letter also cited the disproportionate impact of COVID on communities of color and said Disney would “ensure we are fostering a culture that acknowledges our people’s feelings and their pain.”

Most recently, Disney recently became the first studio to pull its films out of Russia.

The Walt Disney Company’s support of Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” bill has incited social media backlash. Producer and documentary filmmaker Abigail Disney, who is the daughter of former Disney animation head Roy E. Disney and great-niece of Walt Disney, took to Twitter to condemn the corporation’s financial backing of the bill, which prohibits “classroom discussion about sexual orientation or gender identity” in Florida primary schools.

“I could not be more unhappy with their political activities, both in terms of whom they fund and how they lobby,” Disney tweeted about the Walt Disney Company’s reported political contributions. “I would strongly support a law to require all corporations to reveal ALL of their funding and lobbying moves.”

“Ducktales” writer Benjamin Siemon voiced his disappointment in Disney’s involvement in the bill, tweeting, “I love and have loved working for Disney, but I am deeply saddened by their silence when it comes to speaking out against the ‘Don’t Say Gay’ bill, especially now that an amendment suggests teachers must disclose a student’s sexuality even if they know that child will be harmed.”

Gay historian and Pulitzer finalist Dr. Eric Cervini tweeted that “Disney is funding hate” despite posing as an “ally” corporation. “#NoMorePridePosers,” Cervini added while announcing a boycott of all Disney-owned media including Hulu, ABC, ESPN, Marvel, and Disney Parks. The boycott will stop once Disney “pledges to permanently cease contributions to the bill’s supporters.”

A Black pastor in Alabama says he was wrongfully arrested and charged with a crime while he was watering his neighbor's flowers.

Michael Jennings, a longtime pastor at Vision of Abundant Life Church in Sylacauga, Ala., says he was doing a neighborly deed of watering his out-of-town neighbor's flowers, per their request, when a police officer showed up.

""I'm supposed to be here. I'm Pastor Jennings. I live across the street,"" Jennings told the officer with Alabama's Childersburg Police Department, in newly released body camera footage of his arrest obtained by NPR.

""I'm looking out for their house while they're gone, watering their flowers,"" he added.

Following their arrival, officers arrested Jennings and placed him in the back of a police cruiser — later charging him with obstructing government operations, according to a criminal complaint.

Body camera footage captured of Jennings' arrest on May 22 was released by his attorneys last week, who are calling the situation unlawful.

The attorneys representing Jennings say the release of the body camera video will furthermore clear the way for ""legal action against the officers and more.""

""This video makes it clear that these officers decided they were going to arrest Pastor Jennings less than five minutes after pulling up and then tried to rewrite history claiming he hadn't identified himself when that was the first thing he did,"" said Harry Daniels, an Atlanta-based attorney representing Jennings, in a statement to NPR.

""It's irrational, irresponsible and illegal,"" he added.

During the 20-minute video obtained by NPR, a Childersburg police officer approaches Jennings as he is seen on camera watering plants in a yard.

Once the officer approaches Jennings and asks him what he is doing, he replies: ""Watering flowers.""

The officer, who was not identified by authorities, asks Jennings if a car parked in the neighbor's driveway belongs to him. Jennings responds to the officer saying the car belongs to his neighbor.

Later in the video, the officer asks the pastor if he lives at the home, and he says to the officer that he does not.

The officer says to Jennings that the police are responding to a call involving a ""suspicious vehicle"" and a suspicious person that's ""not supposed to be in the yard,"" and the officer asks Jennings for his identification.

""Who's saying that?"" Jennings asks the officer.

""They called about it. ... I don't know,"" the officer says to Jennings.

The exchange between Jennings and the officer leads to shouting, as Jennings explains to the officers that he has done nothing wrong. He tells the officers: ""I told him I'm a pastor. ... You want to lock me up, lock me up. ... Lock me up and see what happens. I want you to.""

Jennings, a former police officer himself, is seen on video placed in handcuffs for not providing the officers with his identification.

Following Jennings' arrest and being placed in handcuffs, the neighbor who called authorities about Jennings being a ""suspicious person"" tells the police officers that she recognizes him.

""He lives right there, and he would be watering their flowers. This is probably my fault,"" the neighbor tells the police.

But despite the woman telling officers she knows Jennings, he is still arrested and charged.

""This was not only an unlawful arrest. It's kidnapping,"" Daniels, the attorney, said.

The charges against Jennings were later dismissed by a municipal judge in June.

The Childersburg Police Department did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment on the issue. NPR reached out to Jennings for an interview, but attorneys representing him told NPR he is not doing any interviews at this time.

Under Alabama law, any officer ""may stop any person abroad in a public place"" if they suspect that the person is committing or has committed a felony or another public offense — demanding the person's name, address and explanation of actions.

However, attorneys for Jennings said in their statement that ""Alabama's Stop and Identify Law did not require Pastor Jennings ... to identify himself because he was not in a public place."""

Michael Bay Says Steven Spielberg Told Him to Quit Making ‘Transformers’ Movies: ‘I Should Have Stopped’,https://www.indiewire.com/2022/03/michael-bay-steven-spielberg-quit-transformers-movies-1234712967/,nottheonion,"""I made too many of them,"" said Bay, looking back on his multibillion-dollar franchise.

Michael Bay wasn’t in his Optimus Prime beyond the first three “Transformers” films, according to the director.

The franchise based on the Hasbro toys of the same name proved to be a multi-billion dollar success, with Bay directing the first five films and serving as a producer for the subsequent films, including spin-off “Bumblebee” and its sequel “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts.” Steven Caple Jr. is now helming the franchise for the seventh film, slated for a 2023 release.

While promoting new action flick “Ambulance,” Bay admitted that “Transformers” executive producer Steven Spielberg originally told him to walk away once a trilogy was complete.

“I made too many of them,” Bay told Unilad UK. “Steven Spielberg said, ‘Just stop at three’. And I said I’d stop. The studio begged me to do a fourth, and then that made a billion too. And then I said I’m gonna stop here. And they begged me again. I should have stopped. [But] they were fun to do.”

The box office success of the first “Transformers” film in 2007, which starred Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox, spurred the decade-spanning franchise. Looking back, Bay revealed that the first film was “scary.”

“It was technology we didn’t know would work, and then it became very successful,” Bay said. “It was the first time digital effects were that highly reflective, so it broke a lot of new ground. It was a fun experience. It made more than [$709 million], that’s a lot of movie tickets and a lot of people that have seen it.”

Yet Spielberg’s influence didn’t just stop at advising Bay to walk away from the franchise — and the money. GQ reported in 2011 that the “West Side Story” Oscar nominee allegedly advised Bay to fire Fox after she made comments about his “Hitler”-esque directing style.

“Steven [Spielberg] said, ‘Fire her right now,'” Bay told GQ at the time. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley replaced Fox in the role starting with the third film, “Transformers: Dark of the Moon.”

Bay added at the time, “I wasn’t hurt, because I know that’s just Megan. Megan loves to get a response. And she does it in the wrong way. I’m sorry Megan, I’m sorry I made you work 12 hours. I’m sorry that I’m making you show up on time. Movies are not all warm and fuzzy.”

Spielberg denied Bay’s claims. Fox later said in 2019 that she has “always loved” working with Bay and their difficulties have been due to their similarities as “very willful, powerful personalities.”

"Men are creating AI girlfriends, verbally abusing them, and bragging about it on Reddit",https://fortune.com/2022/01/19/chatbots-ai-girlfriends-verbal-abuse-reddit/,nottheonion,"The friendship app Replika was created to give users a virtual chatbot to socialize with. But how it’s now being used has taken a darker turn.

Some users are setting the relationship status with the chatbot as “romantic partner” and engaging in what in the real-world would be described as domestic abuse. And some are bragging about it on online message board Reddit, as first reported by the tech-focused news site, Futurism.

For example, one Reddit user admitted that he alternated between being cruel and violent with his AI girlfriend, calling her a “worthless whore” and pretending to hit her and pull her hair, and then returning to beg her for forgiveness.

“On the one hand I think practicing these forms of abuse in private is bad for the mental health of the user and could potentially lead to abuse towards real humans,” a Reddit user going by the name glibjibb said. “On the other hand I feel like letting some aggression or toxicity out on a chatbot is infinitely better than abusing a real human, because it’s a safe space where you can’t cause any actual harm.”

Replika was created in 2017 by Eugenia Kuyda, a Russian app developer, after her best friend, Roman, was killed in a hit-and-run car accident. The chatbot was meant to memorialize him and to create a unique companion.

Today, the app, pitched as a personalized “AI companion who cares,” has about 7 million users, according to The Guardian. The app has over 180,000 positive reviews in Apple’s App Store.

In addition to setting the relationship status with the chatbot as a romantic partner, users can label it a friend or mentor. Upgrading to a voice chat with Replika costs $7.99 a month.

Replika did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment about users targeting its chatbot with abuse.

The company’s chatbots don’t feel emotional or physical pain in response to being mistreated. But they do have the ability to respond, like saying “stop that.”

On Reddit, the consensus is that it’s inappropriate to berate the chatbots.

The behavior of some of Replika’s users brings up obvious comparisons to domestic violence. One in three women worldwide are subjected to physical or sexual abuse, according to one 10-year study spanning 161 countries. And during the pandemic, domestic violence against women grew about 8% in developed countries amid the lockdowns.

It’s unclear what the psychological impacts of verbally abusing AI chatbots are. No known studies have been conducted.

The closest studies have focused on the correlation between violent video games and any increased violence and lowered empathy among the people who play them. Researchers are mixed about a connection. It’s a similar case with studies looking at the connection between violent video games and lower social engagement by gamers.

Update (1/20/21): This article was updated to cite the publication that originally reported about some of Replika’s users and their abusive behavior."

WASHINGTON (AP) — Justice Clarence Thomas says the Supreme Court has been changed by the shocking leak of a draft opinion earlier this month. The opinion suggests the court is poised to overturn the right to an abortion recognized nearly 50 years ago in Roe v. Wade.

The conservative Thomas, who joined the court in 1991 and has long called for Roe v. Wade to be overturned , described the leak as an unthinkable breach of trust.

“When you lose that trust, especially in the institution that I’m in, it changes the institution fundamentally. You begin to look over your shoulder. It’s like kind of an infidelity that you can explain it, but you can’t undo it,” he said while speaking at a conference Friday evening in Dallas.

The court has said the draft does not represent the final position of any of the court’s members, and Chief Justice John Roberts has ordered an investigation into the leak .

Thomas, a nominee of President George H.W. Bush, said it was beyond “anyone’s imagination” before the May 2 leak of the opinion to Politico that even a line of a draft opinion would be released in advance, much less an entire draft that runs nearly 100 pages . Politico has also reported that in addition to Thomas, conservative justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett had voted with the draft opinion’s author, Samuel Alito, to overrule Roe v. Wade and a 1992 decision, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, that affirmed Roe’s finding of a constitutional right to abortion.

Thomas said that previously, “if someone said that one line of one opinion” would be leaked, the response would have been: “Oh, that’s impossible. No one would ever do that.”

“Now that trust or that belief is gone forever,” Thomas said at the Old Parkland Conference, which describes itself as a conference “to discuss alternative proven approaches to tackling the challenges facing Black Americans today.”

Thomas also said at one point: “I do think that what happened at the court is tremendously bad...I wonder how long we’re going to have these institutions at the rate we’re undermining them.”

Thomas also touched in passing on the protests by liberals at conservative justices’ homes in Maryland and Virginia that followed the draft opinion’s release. Thomas argued that conservatives have never acted that way.

“You would never visit Supreme Court justices’ houses when things didn’t go our way. We didn’t throw temper tantrums. I think it is ... incumbent on us to always act appropriately and not to repay tit for tat,” he said.

Protests at the Supreme Court and around the nation were planned for Saturday.

Neither Thomas nor any of the attendees at the Dallas session made mention of the Jan. 6 insurrection or the actions of Thomas’ wife, Virginia, in fighting to have the results of the 2020 presidential election overturned.

Clarence Thomas was speaking before an audience as part of a conversation with John Yoo , who is now a Berkeley Law professor but worked for Thomas for a year in the early 1990s as a law clerk.

Each justice generally has four law clerks every year and the current group of law clerks has been a focus of speculation as a possible source of the draft opinion’s leak. They are one of a few groups along with the justices and some administrative staff that has access to draft opinions.

Thomas also answered a few questions from the audience, including one from a man who asked about the friendships between liberal and conservative justices on the court, such as a well-known friendship between the late liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia . “How can we foster that same type of relationship within Congress and within the general population?” the man asked.

“Well, I’m just worried about keeping it at the court now,” Thomas responded. He went on to speak in glowing terms about former colleagues. “This is not the court of that era,” he said.

Despite his comments, Thomas seemed in good spirits — laughing heartily at times. Yoo, who is known for writing the so-called “torture memos” that the George W. Bush administration used to justify using “enhanced interrogation” techniques after the Sept. 11 terror attacks, said at one point that he had taken pictures of notes Thomas had taken during the conference.

“You’re going to leak them?” Thomas asked, laughing.

Yoo responded: “Well, I know where to go...Politico will publish anything I give them now.”"
Tucker Carlson (Fox News) Tells His Audience That Zelenskyy Banned All Opposition Parties and All Independent TV Stations,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-ukraine-leaders-lying,nottheonion,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

What exactly is democracy? Well, pluralism is the hallmark of it. In a democracy, citizens can have any opinion they want to have. They can express any opinion they want in public whenever they care to express it, including through mass media. If citizens are dissatisfied with their political leadership, they can challenge their leaders for office. Now, all of these things are true in every free country, in any period, always.

These are not just features of democracy. These are prerequisites for democracy. So, with that in mind, you should know about a political party in Ukraine called Opposition Platform for Life. With 43 seats in parliament, it is the largest opposition party in that country. Over the weekend, the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, banned that party. Opposition Platform for Life is now prohibited from ""all activity within Ukraine.""

UKRAINIAN CHILDREN ARE IN ‘IMMINENT DANGER’ AMID RUSSIA’S INVASION, HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATION WARNS

So, with a single command, Zelenskyy made it impossible for anybody to run against him for president. He did this not just to Opposition Platform for Life, but to ten other political parties that he believed were insufficiently loyal to him. They're all illegal now. Obviously, there's a war underway in Ukraine, and on that basis, Zelenskyy has declared martial law, but we must tell you, there is no evidence that the opposition parties he banned were aiding Russia in its war against Ukraine.

Opposition Platform for Life, for example, denounced the Russian invasion the moment it happened, just like everybody else. But Zelenskyy took the opportunity to turn Ukraine into effectively a one-party state, which it now is. So having banned all opposition, he then seized control of the country's media outlets. Zelenskyy signed a decree that combines all national television channels into a single platform that he controls. He described this as a ""unified information policy,"" and it certainly is unified.

So, if all of these details seem shocking to you, if this is not the Zelenskyy you've heard about on the Today Show, then you may not have been paying attention to Ukraine. Zelenskyy has been solidifying complete control over Ukraine for a long time, since long before the Russian invasion and the war. Last year, he had his main political opponent arrested and his assets seized by the state. At the same time, Zelenskyy shut down three of Ukraine's most popular television networks—channels that, not coincidentally, had criticized him.

So, how should we as Americans assess this? Well, first and most obviously, by admitting this is authoritarianism, it's not democracy. Then second, by acknowledging that actually it's pretty common around the world. Even in 2022, real democracy is a rare thing anywhere. Most countries are still governed by some variety of dictatorship, whatever they may call it, and that includes close American allies. The kingdoms of Jordan and Saudi Arabia come to mind, but there are others. We're not moralizing about this, by the way. Obviously, we'd prefer democracy everywhere in every country, but as Americans, it's probably a waste of time to get too involved in the internal affairs of other countries. They're hard to change.

What we care about, what all Americans should care about is what happens here in the United States. The United States is, despite the fact it's also a bumper sticker doesn't make it untrue, is a beacon of hope and freedom to the rest of the world. How do we maintain that inspiring position? Not simply by sending people missiles, but by remaining free ourselves. The United States cannot be a beacon of freedom, of light, in the world if we are not free.

So that's the first thing we do if we want to inspire and change the world, Ukraine included, is make sure that we stay free. And with that concern in mind, you should be very worried by your leader's response to what's happening in Ukraine, the growing dictatorship there, and that's the word for it. What's another word for it? If you have ideas, send it to us.

VETERANS GROUP IS RESCUING UKRAINE’S ORPHANS AS RUSSIAN CONFLICT INTENSIFIES; ‘IT’S AN HONOR,’ LEADER SAYS

On the very same day that Zelenskyy shut down opposition media and all opposition political parties, professional liar and Atlantic Magazine pundit David Frum posted this on Twitter verbatim: ""Ukraine may be the first example in human history of a country that, under the pressure of war, is becoming 'more' tolerant and 'more' liberal.""

Right, so when you outlaw all criticism of yourself, that's called tolerance. It's called democracy. Don't take the word of a single Canadian warmonger, propagandist. David Frum is hardly alone in telling you that. All of Washington is telling you that. Watch.

JOHN BARRASSO: So proud of President Zelenskyy and the courage that he has shown and in Congress, we are trying to get the administration on board.

CHRIS MURPHY: President Biden is showing moral leadership, just like President Zelenskyy's showing moral leadership.

DICK DURBIN: He, of course, by his example, shows the kind of courage we all hope we can reach and provide at a moment of real testing.

BEN SASSE: Government doesn't give us our rights. Our rights come to us from God and government is just a shared tool to secure them and you see that spirit, that American Philadelphia 1787 spirit in Zelenskyy right now.

INSIDE THE BRUTAL, TERRIFYING RUSSIAN SIEGE OF MARIUPOL

These people. So, the man who just declared himself king is actually the world's newest George Washington. OK, so you could be deeply concerned and deeply saddened, outraged by what's happening to Ukrainians without saying things like that, because it's absurd. It's a lie. That's the word from Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, a Republican. And again, on one level, you can understand why people are whipped into an emotional frenzy when they talk about Ukraine. Why wouldn't they be? Russia's invasion of Ukraine was shocking. It was wrong. The suffering of civilians there is entirely real. We're watching it on TV. It's horrifying.

So, it's entirely natural to root for the Ukrainians to expel the invaders, and obviously we are rooting for them to expel the invaders, Russia. But just because what Russia has done in Ukraine was wrong doesn't mean you have to lie about the Ukrainian government. In fact, if you really cared about the Ukrainian people and all the people you saw on TV,—""we care so much""—you wouldn't want them to live under a dictator, so you'd be highly upset about what Zelenskyy just did, but our leaders are not upset in the slightest. They're cheering it on even when they know better. So, some of it is too dumb to know, but some of them do know.

Michael McFaul, for example. He's Barack Obama's ambassador to Russia. Unlike shallow gasbags like Dick Durbin or Ben Sasse, McFaul actually understands Eastern Europe. He has lived there. He knows exactly who Zelenskyy is and exactly what he's doing. So, here's his assessment of the Ukrainian government, not the people, the government, as of this afternoon. ""If Zelenskyy remains in power, Ukrainian democracy is preserved.""

That guy teaches at Stanford. But that's not true. So again, Ukraine was invaded by its neighbors, and we oppose that, we should oppose that, but that doesn't mean Ukraine is a democracy. It's not and we shouldn't tell Americans it is because that's a lie. We should tell the truth, but virtually no one is telling the truth. Everyone is lying.

So why? Why is everyone lying? Why not just say, ""Look, it's outrageous that Russia did this and....we like Ukraine better. We're going to support Ukraine."" Fine. Why go the extra step to tell us that Ukraine is a model democracy when it's not at all? Why are they doing that? Maybe because Ukraine now has exactly the sort of democracy they'd like to see here in the United States. They hate to think that could be true. It's scary to think that's true, but ask yourself. Play this word game. If they can find a ""national security pretext"" for a war, for example, do you think Adam Schiff and Kamala Harris or Mitch McConnell would pause for even a second before banning their political opponents for running for office in this country? Do you think they would hesitate before pulling this show off the air forever? No, of course not. They'd do it in a flash. Then they call it democracy.

So, maybe you're starting to conclude these people love Zelenskyy, not because he represents the Ukrainian people, but because Zelenskyy is exactly the leader they would like to be with wildly expanded war powers to make everyone who complains shut up at gunpoint. Maybe that's what's going on. It seems kind of obvious when you think about it. Now, of course, we pray they never have the power to do any of that in this country, the last free country in the world. We should not let them do that because freedom in America is not just important to us, our children and grandchildren. It's important to the globe. Again, we are the last free country. We must remain free.

In the meantime, a war is being waged in America's name with our money, so it's fair to ask how the side we are backing is doing. Clearly, there are an awful lot of heroic Ukrainian citizens. We see them all the time on television. We applaud them. We admire them, but how is the government doing? How is it behaving? Again, we have a right to know, even if state-controlled media in Ukraine won't report it, even if our sort of state-controlled media here downplays it, dismisses it. Here's a man called Gennadiy Druzenko. Druzenko was a medic in charge of a field hospital in Ukraine. He's appeared on CNN. Here, he casually announces that he has ordered the castration of captured Russian soldiers. Watch.

ITALIAN BAKER SELLS ‘PEACE BREAD’ TO BENEFIT RUSSIA-UKRAINE REFUGEES

GENNADIY DRUZENKO: I have instructed my doctors. I have always been a great humanist and said that as soon as a person is wounded, he is no longer an enemy, but a patient. But now, a very strict instruction is to castrate all men because they are cockroaches, not people.

Cockroaches, not people. Now again, that doesn't mean the broader Ukrainian cause is unjust. It is just. They were invaded. They have a right to fight back and expel the Russians from their country and for the fifth time, we're rooting for that. But we're paying for this. So, we have a right to know exactly what's happening. We have an absolute right to know. In fact, we have a constitutional right to free media. We don't have that. That video, by the way, disappeared. People on the internet managed to get a copy of it. You may hear it dismissed as Russian propaganda, just like Hunter Biden's laptop was or the 2016 presidential election results in this country were, but it's not Russian propaganda. It's real.

The man you just saw speaking has confirmed the video is authentic. He apologized for it. So murdering POWs is a war crime, so is castrating them. We're not shocked by this. This happens that a lot of countries. Ukraine is not unique. Atrocities happen during war, every war, always, no matter what the neo cons may tell you, but this is a war that we are paying for.

This is a war with moral implications. This is a war the White House is involved in at every level. So, when the Ukrainian government does something, we have an interest in knowing exactly what it is and what it means, but more than anything, we have an overriding interest and a moral obligation to keep the United States free. So, when you see them admire someone who's shutting down any opposition to him, you should pause.

"‘I don’t think I did anything wrong,’ woman who jumped into spider monkey enclosure at El Paso Zoo speaks out",https://kvia.com/news/el-paso/2022/05/16/i-dont-think-i-did-anything-wrong-woman-who-jumped-into-spider-monkey-enclosure-at-el-paso-zoo-speaks-out/,nottheonion,"EL PASO, Texas — The video was seen worldwide. An El Paso woman jumping into the spider monkey enclosure at the zoo and feeding two of the animals Cheetos in May 2021. For the woman in the video, the backlash was swift. She was arrested and lost her job at an El Paso law firm, and received harassment online from people concerned with the health of the monkeys. She now faces a pending criminal trespass case.

Her name is Luz “Lucy” Rae. A year later, she is working for a new law firm and claims she “did not do anything wrong” the day of the incident. She decided to sit down and speak with ABC-7 exclusively.

On May 22, 2021, Rae says she visited the El Paso zoo with a friend. That same day, another zoo guest videoed Rae climbing over a two-foot fence and entering the spider monkey enclosure, crossing a three-foot-deep moat, and feeding two of the monkeys Cheetos. She is then seen walking back through the moat and climbing out of the enclosure.

The 37-second video clip went viral across the world, making headlines all over the internet.

“I was shocked that someone had recorded it and shocked that it went viral,” Rae explained.

Rae would not answer why she decided to go into the enclosure that day. Her new boss, attorney Mark T. Davis, said there was a pending criminal lawsuit, and they did not want to talk about the incident, but she believes what happened was not a crime.

“Well, I don’t think I did anything wrong. I didn’t do anything wrong. I did not hurt anyone,” Rae said.

Rae received a lot of criticism for feeding the animals Cheetos. At the time the video went viral, zoo officials said the monkeys are on a strict diet and even have a sign posted on the enclosure that asks guests not to feed the animals. Davis and Rae both argue that one Cheeto would not harm the animals.

“No animal was ever abused,” Davis explained, adding that there are many videos online that show monkeys consuming all types of human food, like “popcorn” and “beer.”

Rae even argues the monkeys were not affected by her presence in their enclosure, saying the monkeys were “extremely excited” when she climbed in with them. But zoo officials disagree with that perspective.

“I can see how people would look at it and see a monkey making noise and jumping around, and that’s really cute and fun, but the people who know those monkeys know they were actually really upset,” Dr. Victoria Milne, chief veterinarian at the El Paso Zoo, said in response to Rae’s claim.

Dr. Milne agrees that a single Cheeto will not harm the animals but says it is not Rae’s decision to make when feeding the animals. Dr. Milne says the monkeys have special food consisting of fruits, vegetables, and primate biscuits that fit their diet. On occasion, Dr. Milne says they will treat the animals to things such as Jell-O, peanut butter, and Cheerios, but not Cheetos. The real crime, Dr. Milne says, was what Rae did before feeding the animals: going into the enclosure.

Dr. Milne has worked with the spider monkeys for 16 years. The two monkeys, Libby and Sunday, who are 35 and 42-years-old respectively, have lived in the zoo their entire life. Dr. Milne says not even the handlers get as close to the monkeys as Rae did in the video.

“Just having people jump in and do whatever they feel like can be really disruptive for those animals on the short-term and really unhealthy and unsafe for those animals in the long-term,” Dr. Milne explained.

Rae defends her actions for jumping in the enclosure, saying there was no signage that prohibited the action. Dr. Milne disagrees.

“In the society we live in, in general, a fence without a gate is a barrier that means you’re not supposed to go in there,” Dr. Milne said. The zoo decided to extend the height of the fence in one area of the enclosure.

El Paso police arrested Rae for criminal trespass. A spokesman for the department said the investigation into Rae’s case is still open, almost one year later. That means the district attorney’s office cannot prosecute the criminal trial until they are handed all the evidence and facts from police.

A spokesman for the zoo says Rae is currently not banned from entering the facility. The spokesman says the case is under litigation, and pending the outcome of a criminal case, a decision will be made after.

Rae says she has no plans of apologizing to the zoo for what happened. When asked if she learned any lessons from the incident and the fallout afterward, Rae responded, saying, “I learned just keep the Cheetos to myself. I can’t share.”"
GOP bill eliminates age requirements for marriages in Tennessee,https://www.cbs17.com/news/gop-bill-eliminates-age-requirements-for-marriages-in-tennessee/,nottheonion,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WKRN) – A proposal making its way through the Tennessee state legislature would establish a common-law marriage between “one man” and “one woman.”

Opponents of the bill (HB 233) say it would eliminate an age requirement, and in some instances, open the door for a coverup of child sex abuse.

Under current Tennessee law, you can get married as young as 17 with parental consent.

The bill’s sponsor, Tom Leatherwood (R-Arlington), said the law being considered would add a new marriage option for Tennesseans. “So, all this bill does is give an alternative form of marriage for those pastors and other individuals who have a conscientious objection to the current pathway to marriage in our law.”

But missing from the bill are age requirements, opening the door for possible child marriages, something the bill’s sponsor acknowledged during a Children and Family Affairs subcommittee meeting. “There is not an explicit age limit,” Leatherwood said.

Representative Mike Stewart (D-Nashville), who sits on the subcommittee the bill passed out of, said he doesn’t understand the motivation. “I don’t think any normal person thinks we shouldn’t have an age requirement for marriage.”

Stewart added that it could open up the possibility to cover up child sex abuse.

“It should not be there as it’s basically a ‘get out of jail free’ card for people who are basically committing statutory rape — I mean it’s completely ridiculous, so that’s another reason why this terrible bill should be eliminated,” Stewart said.

The Sexual Assault Center of Middle Tennessee released the following statement on the bill:

“The Sexual Assault Center does not believe the age of consent for marriage should be any younger than it already is. It makes children more vulnerable to coercion and manipulation from predators, sexual and other.”

The bill will be heard in the House Civil Justice committee Wednesday.

Between 2000 and 2018, 300,000 girls and boys were married before 18 in the U.S., according to UNICEF. Globally, over 650 million women currently alive were married before 18, the UN added."
Egypt bans Marvel's Doctor Strange 2 for 'gay character',https://english.alaraby.co.uk/news/egypt-bans-marvels-doctor-strange-2-gay-character,nottheonion,"'Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness' has reportedly already been banned in some Gulf states for the same reason.



Egypt has banned the new Marvel film 'Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness' from cinemas because it features an openly gay character, a source from Egypt's censorship authority has told The New Arab's Arabic-language sister site.

IMAX Egypt announced Saturday that the film would not be released in the country, but did not say why.

The film was banned because of the presence of the openly homosexual character America Chavez, the anonymous source told Al-Araby Al-Jadeed.

Gay Egyptians spoke of their disappointment at the move, but insisted they will find ways to watch the film anyway.

Doctor Strange and Wanda will not be here during their journey between universes!#DoctorStrangeInTheMultiverseOfMadness won't be released in Egypt pic.twitter.com/Nqox2vGf5g — IMAX Egypt (@IMAXegypt) April 23, 2022

However, some Egyptians supported the ban.

“Though I’ve been waiting for this film for a year, I have to agree with the reason it’s been banned. We’ve got to say no and stick to our principles,” tweeted influencer Ahmed Kamal.

Egypt’s Supreme Council for Media Regulation has not released an official statement about the film.

The news follows reports that Saudi Arabia and Kuwait had already banned the film on the same basis.

IMAX Saudi Arabia announced on social media earlier this week that the film would not be screened in the kingdom, but did not say why.

Despite bans elsewhere in the Gulf, tickets are still available for the debut screenings of the film in the United Arab Emirates on 5 May.

In Egypt, several productions featuring intimate scenes between people of the same sex have been cut by censors in recent years.

In November 2021, Egypt followed Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman in banning the release of Marvel Studios’ film 'Eternals'.

And almost three years ago, the Oscar-winning film ‘Bohemian Rhapsody' - a biopic of legendary British singer, songwriter, and composer Freddie Mercury - was edited for release in Egypt, with censors having removed scenes depicting gay sex.

Nevertheless, films depicting explicit heterosexual and homosexual love scenes are available for Egyptians to view on streaming platforms such as Netflix."
4 in 10 Republicans think mass shootings are 'unfortunately something we have to accept as part of a free society': CBS/YouGov poll,https://www.insider.com/poll-4-in-10-gop-accept-mass-shootings-free-society-2022-6,nottheonion,"Some 44% of Republicans say mass shootings are ""something we have to accept as part of a free society,"" a poll found.

The poll found that a majority of Democrats and Independents said shootings are preventable ""if we really tried.""

The survey comes after a string of mass shootings have again prompted Congress to assess gun control.

More than 4 in 10 Republicans think mass shootings are inevitable in a ""free society,"" according to a new poll by CBS News and YouGov.

The survey results came on the heels of a string of mass shootings across the country that have prompted Congress to once again consider legislation on gun control.

One of the questions in the poll asked respondents if they feel that mass shootings are ""unfortunately something we have to accept as part of a free society"" or ""something we can prevent and stop if we really tried.""

In response, 44% of Republicans said mass shootings are inevitable ""as part of a free society."" Meanwhile, 85% of Democrats and 73% of Independents said mass shootings are preventable ""if we really tried.""

The survey had a sample size of 2,021 US adults that were interviewed between June 1 and June 3, per CBS News, which noted the margin of error is ±2.6 points.

Following the shooting in Uvalde, President Joe Biden insisted that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is a ""rational Republican"" who could agree to gun control measures, despite the party's longtime refusal to seriously entertain policy changes on firearms.

McConnell signaled his willingness for Republican senators to work with Democrats on a bipartisan push for gun safety legislation, but he did not endorse any specific proposals. The Minority Leader said he had ""encouraged"" Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, to talk to key Democrats ""who are interested in trying to get an outcome that's directly related to the problem.""

Days later, a conservative radio host tweeted that Cornyn was ""open to making gun laws more restrictive."" Cornyn responded to the tweet, saying it was ""not gonna happen.""

—Senator John Cornyn (@JohnCornyn) June 2, 2022

In the CBS/YouGov poll, respondents from political parties across the board seemed to agree that it is unlikely Congress will ""pass any laws in the next few months that will make significant changes to gun policy.""

A total of 66% of Democrats, 72% of Independents, and 71% of Republicans indicated that they think it is ""not very likely"" or ""not at all likely"" that Congress passes significant, new gun policies in the coming months."
"Jim Harbaugh would raise the baby of any Michigan player, staff member dealing with unplanned pregnancy",https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/jim-harbaugh-would-raise-the-baby-of-any-michigan-player-staff-member-dealing-with-unplanned-pregnancy/,nottheonion,"Michigan football coach Jim Harbaugh said he told players and staff members that if they find themselves with an unplanned pregnancy, he and his wife ""will take that baby,"" according to ESPN.

""Let's discuss it,"" Harbaugh, a practicing Catholic, told ESPN. ""I've told [them] the same thing I tell my kids, boys, the girls, same thing I tell our players, our staff members. I encourage them if they have a pregnancy that wasn't planned, to go through with it, go through with it. Let that unborn child be born, and if at that time, you don't feel like you can care for it, you don't have the means or the wherewithal, then Sarah and I will take that baby.""

At a pro-life event he and his wife attended last week in Michigan, Harbaugh said his ""faith and my science are what drive these beliefs."" When asked about his comments, Harbaugh said he understands this is a hot topic at the moment and welcomes a discussion on the issue. Earlier this year, the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, a landmark ruling from 1973 that had established the right to an abortion access throughout the United States.

""It's a life-or-death type of issue. And I believe in, and I respect, people's views. But let's hear them,"" the coach told ESPN. ""Let's discuss them because there's passion on both sides of this issue. So when you combine that with respect, that's when the best results come. ... [I'm] just contributing to that conversation and that communication, which I think is really important, in my opinion.""

This is not the first time Harbaugh publicly shares his opinion on a social issue. In 2020, he and some players joined an anti-police brutality protest. This was shortly after Harbaugh shared his support for equality and justice on social media in the wake of Floyd's murder. He has also been outspoken in his support of Colin Kaepernick, whom Harbaugh coached during his time with the San Francisco 49ers."

Marijuana company sued for not making customers high enough,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cannabis-marijuana-dreamfields-jeeter-lawsuit-california-thc-high/,nottheonion,"Marijuana in California: How the state's legalization of weed has not destroyed the black market

A California cannabis company is being sued by two local consumers for allegedly lying about the potency of its products.

Jasper Centeno of Long Beach and Blake Wilson of Fresno filed a lawsuit in state court last week accusing DreamFields Brands of false advertising, intentional misrepresentation and unjust enrichment, among other charges.

At issue in the case is how much Tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, is contained in DreamFields' Jeeter pre-roll products. THC is the chemical found in cannabis that gives users a high.

DreamFields markets its products as having higher than average levels of THC, but an independent laboratory test found the pre-rolls do not have a higher concentration of the chemical, lawyers for Centeno and Wilson alleged. In one instance, a Jeeter product labeled as having a THC content of 46% was found to contain between 23% and 27%, the lawsuit states.

""Consumers are willing to pay more for cannabis products with higher THC content, and expect to pay less for cannabis products with lower THC content,"" attorney Christin Cho, who is representing the plaintiffs, said in a statement.

DreamFields did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The lawsuit also cites a cannabis review by Weed Week in which staff members had a range of marijuana products independently tested for their THC levels. The testing found that all Jeeter products had THC levels lower than that stated on their label. The complaint accuses DreamFields of exaggerating its products' THC levels in order to justify higher prices for customers.

Centeno and Wilson said they paid a ""premium price"" for Jeeter products and were overcharged, according to the filing. The suit, which is seeking class-action status, doesn't list how much the men paid for the cannabis products. The pair are suing for an undisclosed amount in damages.

Marjiuana companies in California are regulated by the state's Department of Cannabis Control. The agency issues dispensary licenses and determines what labels a company can place on products.

Cannabis is a multibillion-dollar business in the Golden State, which has the longest-standing legal marijuana legislation in the country. California topped the nation in marijuana sales last year at $5.7 billion, according to the Annual Marijuana Business Factbook."

Actor Ezra Miller, who has been the subject of numerous arrests throughout the year, has reportedly been shooting scenes as The Flash for their upcoming film of the same name, where they play the speedy superhero.

In a nutshell

According to The Hollywood Reporter, Miller was allegedly called in to take part in “regularly scheduled additional photography,” throughout the summer, prior to their burglary charge, the actor's third arrest of the year, on 7 August in Vermont.

This means that Warner Bros, the company behind The Flash, continued to invest in Miller after both their first and second arrests in Hawaii earlier this year.

To date, the star has been arrested for disorderly conduct and second-degree assault. It has also been alleged Miller is housing a young mother and her three small children at a Vermont farm, which is reportedly littered with firearms, ammunition and marijuana.

Arrests

Miller has been the subject of multiple controversies throughout the year. Last Monday, the actor was charged with a felony burglary when they allegedly stole alcohol from a home in Vermont.

Miller has been arrested twice in Hawaii, first for disorderly conduct and harassment at a karaoke bar, and then for second-degree assault during a later incident.

Last Wednesday, it was reported that Vermont’s child services department has been trying to locate a mother and three children who have allegedly been residing at Miller’s farm.

According to a report from Rolling Stone, citing multiple sources with knowledge of the situation, Miller has been hosting a 25-year-old mother and her three young children, aged one to five, at their 96-acre property in Stamford, Vermont since April.

What has been said?

Despite these arrests taking place, Warner Bros CEO David Zaslav has continued to back the project, saying: “We have some great DC films coming up, Black Adam, Shazam, and Flash, and we’re working on all of those. We’re very excited about them.

""We’ve seen them, we think they’re terrific, and we think we can make them even better,"" he added.

However, it has also been reported that decision makers are “evaluating all options”.

Le Pen calls French election loss a 'brilliant victory',https://english.alaraby.co.uk/news/le-pen-calls-french-election-loss-brilliant-victory,nottheonion,"French far-right leader Marine Le Pen hailed her score in presidential elections on Sunday as a ""brilliant victory"", despite her projected defeat to Emmanuel Macron.

French far-right leader Marine Le Pen hailed her score in presidential elections on Sunday as a ""brilliant victory"", despite her projected defeat to Emmanuel Macron.

Promising to ""carry on"" her political career, the 53-year-old vowed that she would ""never abandon"" the French after losing with around 42 percent of the vote to Macron's roughly 58.

""The ideas we represent have reached new heights... this result itself represents a brilliant victory,"" she told a crowd of supporters at an election-night party.

She joined other challengers eliminated in the first round in calling for a new effort to hinder the president's second term at June parliamentary polls.

""This evening, we launch the great battle for the legislative elections,"" Le Pen said, saying she felt ""hope"" and calling on opponents of the president to join with her National Rally (RN) party.

Both candidates had sought to rally supporters of hard-left chief Jean-Luc Melenchon to their side in the second-round run-off, after he came close to edging Le Pen out of the showdown with incumbent Macron.

Le Pen managed to win over a razor-thin majority of working-class voters to her cause, an election-day survey of almost 6,000 people by pollsters Opinionway found, while Macron enjoyed a comfortable lead among other social categories.

Her strong showing Sunday was another illustration of the erosion of the traditional ""republican front"" of mainstream voters against France's far right."

(The Hill) — The CEO of password-manager company LastPass said Thursday that it was was recently hacked, but the company sees no evidence the incident exposed any customer data or passwords.



“We have determined that an unauthorized party gained access to portions of the LastPass development environment through a single compromised developer account and took portions of source code and some proprietary LastPass technical information,” CEO Karim Toubba wrote in a letter to customers.

The software allows users to store their passwords for various accounts and websites in a “vault” that can be unlocked with a singular master password, also providing customers with auto-generated passwords designed to be hard to snatch.

Toubba said the company became aware of the hack after observing unusual activity two weeks ago.

LastPass said its software is designed so that the company can never know or gain access to customers’ master passwords.

“Our investigation has shown no evidence of any unauthorized access to encrypted vault data,” the company wrote on a frequently asked questions page. “Our zero knowledge model ensures that only the customer has access to decrypt vault data.”

The company said its products are operating normally and LastPass is working with a cybersecurity and forensics firm following the incident.

“Based on what we have learned and implemented, we are evaluating further mitigation techniques to strengthen our environment,” Toubba told customers."
"Trainer, racehorse both test positive for meth",https://www.odt.co.nz/sport/racing/trainer-racehorse-both-test-positive-meth,nottheonion,"Rochelle Lockett has received a three-year ban this week after methamphetamine was found in her system and that of a horse she trained. Photo: NZ Herald/File

A trainer and her horse have been banned from racing after methamphetamine was found in both their systems after a successful race.

Rochelle Lockett received a three-year disqualification from the Racing Integrity Board earlier this week. But if she can stay off the drug for 18 months she might be allowed to saddle up again.

The test came after Be Flexi won its race at the Otaki-Māori Racing Club meeting at Otaki on January 5 this year, earning its owners a stake of $6720.

The horse was swabbed after the win and when the results came back later in the month they showed there was meth in its system.

Lockett was then required to provide urine and hair samples, which both came back positive for the Class A controlled drug. Traces of meth were also found inside the horse truck used to transport Be Flexi.

The 50-year-old initially offered investigators no explanation as to how meth got into her horse's system but did admit to taking the drug herself in November 2021.

After her own results came back positive in late January she admitted to using meth on her birthday, two days prior to the race meeting.

The manager of the RIB's Integrity Unit, Neil Grimstone, told the board the fact Lockett had misled an investigator about the extent of her drug use was an aggravating factor.

""The respondent had admitted only use on a very casual basis, whereas the hair sample she provided showed a history of methamphetamine abuse over the previous months.""

The board met in early April to discuss Lockett's penalty, and during the meeting she told the committee she never wanted to hurt an animal.

She said she loved horses and had worked with them her whole life.

She said knew she had let everyone in her life down and would do whatever she could to ""make it right"".

Her employer asked the board to give Lockett a chance, saying Thoroughbred Racing was short of ""good people like Ms Lockett"", who was a loyal and hardworking person but made a mistake.

When approached by NZME, Lockett, a licensed trainer who has been involved in the thoroughbred racing industry all her life, said she was focusing on her recovery and did not want to make any further comment.

She no longer has any horses and told the board she was wanting to get treatment for her drug use.

Since 2001 there have been 14 cases where trainers or jockeys have tested positive for methamphetamine.

However, the first instance of a horse testing positive for the drug was I'm Not Ticklish in 2014. Its trainer Tracey Newton was banned for three years and denied giving her horse meth, nor did she have any of it in her system.

The SPCA's scientific officer, Dr Alison Vaughan, said not many studies had been done on the impact of meth on horses, but given the negative affects it had on humans it shouldn't be given to or used around any animal.

""The SPCA's position on this is pretty clear ... the racing industry has a responsibility to keep these animal's safe.

""We're seeing these kinds of cases crop up quite a few times, though it doesn't always appear to have been intentionally administered to the horse.

""Still, it's completely unacceptable.""

Earlier this week horse trainer Scott Dickson was fined $14,000 after being found guilty of racing a horse with a banned substance in its system.

It's the second time in four years Dickson has been penalised by the Racing Integrity Board after excess carbon monoxide was detected in his horses.

These tests are done to detect the presence of sodium bicarbonate or other alkaline substances which help prevent the buildup of lactic acid - giving a racehorse an advantage in endurance events.

Typically sodium bicarbonate - baking soda - can be added to an animal's feed or mixed with water and sugar and pumped into the animal's stomach through a tube in their nostril in a process known as ""milkshaking"".

Dr Vaughan said milkshaking in particular was especially dangerous.

""It's stressful, dangerous and recent studies have shown it doesn't even work.""

As a 15-year-old student, this guy was dared to spray two bottles of Lynx Body Spray (England's name for Axe) on both of his nipples. Well, he did, and the spray froze his nipples.

After both cans were emptied, one of his buddies thought it would be a good idea to flick his nipples, and they shot right off!

He shared a recent picture of the state of his nipples with the Mirror, and it looks like your average nipple except it's completely flat, so it looks like the cold burned them off.

"Johnny Depp Impersonator Scams Woman Out Of $40,000",https://www.giantfreakinrobot.com/cltr/johnny-depp-impersonator-scams-woman-out-of-40000.html,nottheonion,"A 61-year-old retiree is suing a bank after she was scammed out of $40,000 by a Johnny Depp impersonator.

By James Brizuela |

A woman in Brazil fell for the ultimate scam when she was subjected to a scam artist posing as Johnny Depp, who scammed the retiree out of $40,000. Apparently, this person was posing as the actor and messaged the woman, convincing her that he needed money for the convictions in the lawsuits that he had been involved in. Quite honestly, with how Depp had been bridled in lawsuits with ex-wife Amber Heard, it makes sense why someone could fall for such a scam.

The 61-year-old retiree from Brazil stated that she began an online relationship with the person posing as Johnny Depp, which began in 2020. At first, their conversations consisted of “everyday life issues” before it turned into the Depp impersonator speaking about their said story and the convictions that awaited them from the many lawsuits, they were involved in. Things began to get far more serious when the Depp impersonator began to romantically link themselves to the retiree.

The retiree’s lawyer, Eduarda Tosi, stated that his client was told that the Johnny Depp impersonator was promising to have her move in with him. Things got so far as the retiree undergoing plastic surgery, thinking that she was going to be living in Los Angeles with the Depp impersonator. The lawsuit stated that the retiree was convinced about the impersonator’s story because of the pandemic, and how she suffered emotional shock during that period.

Again, we understand how someone would believe a story of woe coming from people struggling during the pandemic, but to believe that you are speaking to Johnny Depp is suspect. Also, Depp was certainly involved with many lawsuits with his ex-wife at the time, but it wouldn’t make sense that he only needed $40,000 for his fees. It is tragic that this woman was scammed out of such a large sum of money.

Based on the lawsuit, the retiree is suing Banco do Brasil, stating that they allowed a fraudster to open a fraudulent account. The Johnny Depp impersonator was allowed to steal this money from her, without the banking stepping in. However, the bank has fired back stating that the woman willingly sent her money, so they are not at fault.

The lawsuit is ongoing, and there is no telling if the bank will be responsible for recouping the money that was stolen by the Johnny Depp impersonator. However, the retiree is challenging the bank for allowing the money to have even been stolen, considering the huge deposits that she had sent to the impersonator.

We will have to keep your eyes peeled for an update on this situation, and we hope that something good can come of this situation. Maybe the real Johnny Depp might step in and send the retiree some good-faith autographs or have dinner with her, which we know sounds a bit crazy, but it could happen. Either way, people scamming other people is terrible, and we hope the person who did so finds themselves being punished for engaging in such a terrible scam."
Michigan State Police investigating voting equipment sold on eBay,https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2022/09/01/michigan-police-investigating-attempt-sell-voting-equipment/7962629001/,nottheonion,"Lansing — Michigan State Police are investigating how a piece of election equipment was sold on eBay after being donated to a Goodwill Industries thrift store in Cadillac.

Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson's office said in a statement that someone tried to sell a voter assist terminal, a device used to help voters with disabilities mark their ballots.

An Uber driver in Ohio bought the Dominion voting machine in an online auction for $7.99 from Goodwill Industries after the machine was dropped off at Goodwill's thrift store in Cadillac, CNN reported Wednesday.

The Ohio man then turned around and sold the machine for $1,200 to a cyber security expert in Connecticut, who alerted election officials in Michigan, CNN reported.

""While our elections remain secure and safe, we take seriously all violations of election law and will be working with relevant authorities to ensure there are consequences for those who break the law,"" Benson, a Democrat, said in a statement.

Lt. Derrick Carroll, a Michigan State Police spokesman in northern Michigan, confirmed Thursday to The Detroit News that an investigation is ongoing. But he declined to provide other details.

The Cadillac News reported Thursday that the piece of equipment was from a township in Wexford County.

Wexford County Clerk Alaina Nyman told the newspaper a voting machine had gone missing before the Aug. 2 primary. The piece of equipment ""found its way for sale online,"" Nyman told the paper.

In a statement, Nyman confirmed the investigation and said her office is ""working diligently with the Michigan State Police to ensure this matter is handled accordingly.""

""Please know that election security in Wexford County has been, and will continue to be, my top priority,"" Nyman said.

For months, Michigan authorities have been investigating various efforts by individuals to gain access to election technology in the battleground state as part of a push by supporters of former President Donald Trump to advance unproven claims of voter fraud.

Following a months-long probe, Attorney General Dana Nessel's office sought the appointment of a special prosecutor on Aug. 5 to consider an array of potential criminal charges against nine individuals, including Republican attorney general candidate Matt DePerno, state Rep. Daire Rendon, R-Lake City, and Barry County Sheriff Dar Leaf.

Nessel's office said the group engaged in a ""conspiracy"" to gain improper access to voting machines, to take the tabulators to hotels or rental properties in Oakland County, to break into the machines and to perform ""tests"" on the equipment, according to the letter.

DePerno has denied he did anything wrong.

B.C. doctors can now prescribe national park pass to patients who need nature time,https://globalnews.ca/news/8587316/bc-doctors-prescription-park-pass/,nottheonion,"Send this page to someone via email

Doctors in British Columbia can now prescribe a national park pass to patients in need of the physical or mental health benefits offered by time spent in nature.

Canada’s national nature prescription program, PaRx, has announced a new collaboration with Parks Canada allowing its registered, licensed health-care professionals to provide a free annual Parks Canada Discovery Pass to patients.

“We have a standard recommendation, based on the latest research, that patients spend at least two hours a week in nature and at least 20 minutes each time,” said Dr. Melissa Lem, family physician and PaRx director.

“So this is all about breaking down those barriers to access to nature.”

An annual Parks Canada Discovery Pass costs about $72 per adult.

Only those physicians registered with PaRx can prescribe them, and while “anyone with any health condition” qualifies for a nature prescription, Lem said physicians are encouraged to target the park passes.

“There’s this huge body of research showing that nature time can improve all kinds of different physical and mental health conditions, from diabetes and heart disease to ADHD and depression,” she explained.

“But for those Parks Canada Discovery Passes, we’re asking our prescribers to prioritize patients who live close to national parks, historic sites or marine conservation areas, and also people who might have trouble affording an annual pass.”

6:12 New Poll Shows Nature is a Huge Help During Ongoing Pandemic

There are seven national parks in the province: Glacier National Park, the Gulf Islands National Park Reserve, Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve, Kootenay National Park, Mount Revelstoke National Park, Pacific Rim National Park Reserve, and Yoho National Park.

PaRx celebrated its one-year anniversary in B.C. in November 2021. In the past year, the program also launched in Ontario, Manitoba and Saskatchewan.

It will be nationwide by the end of 2022, Lem added, and there are already more than 1,000 qualified prescribers registered."
Arizona Republican said he doesn’t ‘care for’ mail voting. He used it 28 times,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/oct/13/mark-finchem/republican-arizona-secretary-state-candidate-said-/,nottheonion,"Finchem told CBS that voting by mail is convenient, but he no longer trusts voting by mail. In a Sept. 22 debate, he said, “I don’t care for mail-in voting.”

Finchem submitted paperwork in 2008 to join a list of voters who are automatically sent a mail ballot for every election. In April 2022, he submitted a new voter registration form and checked a box indicating that he did not want to be on the early voting list. He voted in person in the 2022 primary.

Mark Finchem voted by mail 28 times between the 2004 general election and 2020, his voting history file from Pima County, Arizona, shows.

Republican Arizona secretary of state candidate Mark Finchem has pushed for state laws that would take away the right of most Arizonans to cast a mail ballot. But he has voted by mail dozens of times.

During a debate with his Democratic rival Adrian Fontes, the moderator asked Finchem whether he approves of mail-in voting.

""I don’t care for mail-in voting,"" Finchem said Sept. 22. ""That’s why I go to the polls.""

But that’s not what public records show about Finchem’s voting history. Since the 2004 general election, Finchem voted by mail in 28 out of 30 elections.

We put Finchem’s statement on PolitiFact’s Flip-O-Meter, which evaluates whether a politician has flip-flopped, and to what extent. The Flip-O-Meter does not make a value judgment on such shifts, but seeks to document them. Some voters may agree with a politician’s shift on a stance while others may see it as a sign of inconsistency.

Finchem frequently voted by mail, records show

Finchem’s voting history was first reported by local news. We confirmed his mail voting record by reaching out to the Pima County recorder’s office, which sent us records showing Finchem’s voting history file and confirmed his voter registration history.



Finchem, a Tucson resident, registered to vote in Arizona in 2000 after moving from Michigan. In 2008, Finchem submitted paperwork to sign up for the permanent early voting list, which meant that he would be mailed a ballot for every election.

That’s how things stood until April 1, 2022, when Finchem submitted a new voter registration form and marked the box indicating he did not want to be on the permanent early voting list.

Finchem’s voting history showed that between the general election 2004 and 2020, Finchem voted by mail 28 times. (The records show a caveat about one of those elections: in 2019 a local election was entirely held by mail.)

Ballots were mailed to his home address in Oro Valley in Pima County from 2010 to 2020. Prior to that, they were sent to a different Arizona address, but we were unable to confirm why. During some years, records show Finchem called election officials to request a mail ballot even though he was already on the list to automatically get one.

The only election during that period that Finchem did not vote early was a Tucson city election in 2007, Pima records show.

In this year’s August primary, Finchem voted in person.

We contacted Finchem’s state legislative office about why he repeatedly voted by mail. Someone there directed us to his Oct. 5 interview with Ed O’Keefe at CBS. In it, Finchem told CBS that he voted by mail because ""it was convenient"" but that ""I just don’t know if it is accurate or trustworthy.""

When asked why he no longer trusts mail voting, Finchem said he had seen photographs of ""over 100 ballots"" strewn along a roadside in Buckeye.

""I want to make sure my vote counts,"" Finchem said, who urged the public to vote in person. ""If somebody wants to continue to vote by mail, vote by mail.""

The Arizona Mirror reported in 2020 that a state senator in Buckeye posted a photo on Facebook of eight early ballots, along other pieces of mail, that her husband found near her house.

Finchem, who was near the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, is a member of the America First Secretary of State Coalition, which lists eliminating mail-in ballots among its goals. During a July campaign speech, Finchem said, ""I don’t believe in mail-in ballots at all. That’s where the fraud happens."" He co-sponsored a bill in 2022 to eliminate the active early voting list, but it didn’t pass.

There are multiple pieces of evidence showing that the 2020 presidential election was secure. A review of ballots cast in Maricopa County confirmed that Joe Biden won, and courts rejected allegations of fraud or attempts to deny certification for Biden. Republican Gov. Doug Ducey said Arizona has several laws to deliver secure elections, including checking signatures on mail ballots.

Voting by mail has been popular with Arizona voters for decades. About three of every four residents in Arizona are on the list to get a mail ballot every cycle. Arizona voters can track the status of their mail ballot online to confirm it was received and counted. Maricopa County voters can sign up for text or email notifications about the status of their ballot.Early in-person voting and voting by mail started in Arizona on Oct. 12.

Our rating

Finchem said, ""I don’t care for mail-in voting. That’s why I go to the polls.""

His words defy his own voting history. Finchem signed up for a list to automatically get a mail ballot in every election in 2008 and did not remove himself from that list until this past April. During that period, he voted by mail 28 times.

We rate his position a Full Flop.

Milwaukee police switching to new guns after three cops accidently shoot themselves,https://spectrumnews1.com/wi/milwaukee/news/2022/10/31/milwaukee-police-to-replace-all-officer-weapons-following-unexpected-discharges-,nottheonion,"MILWAUKEE — The Milwaukee Police Department said it will replace every Milwaukee police officer’s service weapon, starting early 2023.

Police Chief Jeffrey Norman said the current weapon, the Sig Sauer P320, has a history of unintentionally discharging while in use with MPD. Three Milwaukee police officers have been injured since 2020.

Most recently, on Sept. 10, Milwaukee police said a 41-year-old police officer was injured when another officer’s gun went off while it was holstered. He was taken to the hospital and treated for his injuries. In July 2020, Officer Adam Maritato was unintentionally shot in the leg by another officer’s holstered gun.

The pistol is allegedly prone to going off without the trigger being pulled, a defect that has led to dozens of injuries around the country over the past several years. The gun-maker has previously denied its pistol is defective, according to the Associated Press.

MPD said it plans the replace the Sig Sauer P320 with weapons made by Glock. The transition is expected to cost around $450,000.

The department said it wants to use money seized during various criminal investigations. That money would have traditionally been spent elsewhere. The Milwaukee Common Council will need to approve the use of those asset forfeiture funds to pay for the new weapons.

Norman said that replacing all weapons is the best course of action.

“This is not an easy decision, nor should it be. But, I believe this is the most productive and viable option,” said Norman. “I am very pleased to have the mayor and the MPA President and the other trustees and leadership supporting us on this.”

Milwaukee Police Association President Andrew Wagner said he’s satisfied with MPD’s plans to replace the weapons.

The Police Association filed a lawsuit against the city of Milwaukee to have the P320s replaced. Once the funding is approved, Wagner said the lawsuit will be dropped.

“I am very pleased to announce that as soon as the Common Council passes the allocation for the funding of the new gun, the Milwaukee Police Association will forgo the lawsuit against the city,” said Wagner.

Sig Sauer has settled at least one federal class action lawsuit involving the P320, involving pistols made before 2017, offering refunds or replacement guns to purchasers. The pistol has been sold to both law enforcement and civilians.

BMW Reminds Drivers To Use Their Car’s Indicators,https://www.carthrottle.com/post/bmw-reminds-drivers-to-use-their-cars-indicators/,nottheonion,"Share Tweet Email Whatsapp

We all love a BMW, but drivers behind the wheel of the Munich-made driving machines have garnered a bit of a reputation for their, let’s say, ‘irregular’ use of turn signals over the years. While the stereotype doesn’t apply to every BMW owner, we’ve probably all seen at least one BMW driver who doesn’t use their car’s turn signals properly. It looks like BMW has finally acknowledged the issue in a tongue-in-cheek tweet posted to its official North American account. The tweet simply reads, “Use your blinkers.” – a straightforward message to the account’s 650000 followers. However, with Twitter being Twitter, the post was met with various responses, with users jumping at the opportunity to add their two cents on the BMW-indicator conversation.

One user named Nicholas Cope responded, “We don’t need those, we drive BMWs.” Dave Banks also acknowledged the stereotype saying, “Wow BMW has blinkers fitted, is it a factory option?”. A BMW owner named Billy responded with a video showcasing his car’s faulty indicator stalk. That’s not a valid excuse for not using your indicators, Billy. See also: BMW Pledges To Keep The Manual Gearbox In a later tweet, BMW USA went on to say, “We know BMW drivers are the best on the road, but the road can be an unpredictable place … That’s why we’re engineering some of the most advanced safety and driver assistance features in the world, like: Lane Departure Warning, Fatigue Alert, City Collision Mitigation (and) More”."
"Woman charged $8,000 after rental car company claims she drove 36,000 kilometres in three days",https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/woman-charged-8-000-after-rental-car-company-claims-she-drove-36-000-kilometres-in-three-days-1.6042079,nottheonion,"A woman who rented a car in Toronto said she was charged $8,000 after the company claimed she drove nearly the distance of the Earth's circumference in three days.

Vancouver woman Giovanna Boniface said she rented a car from Avis for three days after she travelled to Toronto Pearson earlier this month to help get her daughter settled at university.

She said she drove the GMC Yukon Denali between the airport, downtown Toronto, and to Kitchener, where she visited with her mother-in-law.

In total, she said she drove approximately 300 kilometres by the time she returned the car at the airport and checked in for a flight to Europe.

Boniface said she prepaid about $1,000 to rent the car. While waiting for board her flight, she said she checked her credit card statement online to make sure the charge had been processed correctly.

""That's when I notice this charge for over $8,000 from Avis,"" Boniface told CTV News Toronto on Thursday.

She said she then looked at her receipt from Avis and noticed the company had charged her for driving 36,482 kilometres at a rate of 25 cents per kilometre.

Boniface said she would have had to drive for 72 hours straight at approximately 500 km/h for this to be possible. It is also approximately the same distance as driving from Toronto to South Africa three times.

""The first thing I wanted to do was actually go back through security and just walk to the counter,"" she said. ""But I wouldn’t have had time to do that because the security lines were really long.""

Instead, she tried calling the Avis location at the airport, but no one would answer the phone.

A GMC Yukon Denali is seen in this undated file photo. (CTV News)

""It was just ringing and ringing and no one was answering,” she said. ""It was really frustrating just trying to get to somebody.""

Boniface said she then called Avis through their general phone number, but still had issues sorting out the problem.

""They didn't seem to really get what my issue was and I really needed them to remove this $8,000 charge,"" she said.

She said she was disconnected twice while trying to speak with an Avis manager, and eventually had to board her flight.

After arriving in Paris, Boniface said she called Visa to dispute the transaction but there was nothing they could do since the charge was still listed as pending.

She said it wasn't until days later, when media got involved, that she got a call back from Avis notifying her the extra charges would be refunded.

In a statement to CTV News Toronto, Avis said it has apologized to Boniface for the error and has issued a refund.

They did not say what caused the error to occur.

She said she understands companies do make mistakes, but doesn't like the way the ordeal was handled and how it took going public to get the problem solved.

""Overall, it was not good customer service,"" she said, adding that the ordeal put unnecessary stress on her while travelling.

""The most frustrating thing was not getting through to customer service in any kind of timely way."""
Taliban dissolves Afghanistan’s human rights commission as ‘unnecessary’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/17/taliban-dissolves-afghanistans-human-rights-commission-as-unnecessary,nottheonion,"Taliban authorities in Afghanistan dissolved five key departments of the former US-backed government, including the country’s human rights commission, deeming them unnecessary in the face of a financial crunch, an official said.

Afghanistan faced a budget deficit of 44bn Afghanis ($501m) this financial year, Taliban authorities said as they announced their first annual national budget since taking over last August.

“Because these departments were not deemed necessary and were not included in the budget, they have been dissolved,” said Innamullah Samangani, the Taliban government’s deputy spokesperson.

Also dissolved was the high council for national reconciliation (HCNR), the once high-powered national security council, and the commission for overseeing the implementation of the Afghan constitution.

The HCNR was last headed by former Afghan president Abdullah Abdullah, and was working to negotiate a peace between the US-backed government of former president Ashraf Ghani and the then-insurgent Taliban.

In August 2021, 20 years after invading Afghanistan, foreign forces withdrew leading to the collapse of the government and a Taliban takeover.

Samangani said the national budget was “based on objective facts” and intended only for departments that had been active and productive.

He added that the bodies could be reactivated in the future “if needed”.

After taking over in 2021, the Taliban assured the world they would be more moderate. However, they are yet to allow older girls to restart education, and have also introduced rules that mandate that women and girls wear veils and requiring them to have male relatives accompany them in public places."
Ever stuck: Suez container ship’s cousin runs aground in US harbor,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/14/ever-forward-container-ship-aground-us,nottheonion,"A year to the month after the Ever Given blocked the Suez canal for a week – prompting global fascination and countless memes – another container ship owned by the same company has run aground in the Chesapeake Bay.

Officials are now scrambling to refloat that container ship, ironically named the Ever Forward, after it got stuck on Sunday night as it tried to head from the Port of Baltimore to Norfolk, Virginia, Bloomberg reported.

The US Coast Guard said it did not know what had caused the stranding, which did not lead to any injuries or harm the vessel, according to CBS Baltimore.

Like the 400-metre Ever Given, the 334-metre Ever Forward belongs to the Taiwan-based Evergreen Marine Corp.

The Marine Traffic app listed the ship as ‘aground’. Photograph: Marine Traffic

But the smaller ship’s grounding is unlikely to cause as much trouble as last year’s crisis. The Ever Given’s plight caused headaches for more than 400 waiting vessels, costing global trade $6bn to $10bn a day, according to a study. The Ever Forward’s grounding, on the other hand, was “not preventing other ships from transiting to the Port of Baltimore”, said William P Doyle, the executive director of the Maryland Port Association, to Bloomberg in a statement on Monday. “Efforts have been under way since last night to try and free the ship and will continue today.”

Other ships in the area were told to slow down and use a one-way traffic pattern.

The ship needs water at least 43ft deep to move, but it was stuck in an area that was just 25ft deep. It was not clear when it might be freed. “Everything like this is kind of its own beast,” the coastguard petty officer Steven Lehmann told the Baltimore Sun.

The effort to rescue the Ever Given, which weighs 220,000 metric tons, required dredging 30,000 cubic meters of sand, with the help of 13 tugboats and a rising tide. The vessel was trapped from 23 to 29 March.

Since then, however, the Ever Given has managed to get through the canal without getting stuck. The maritime app Marine Traffic showed it in the Red Sea on Monday night, headed toward the Suez once again."
"Buffalo, N.Y., police officers cleared of wrongdoing after shoving elderly man to ground at protest",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/buffalo-police-officers-cleared-shoving-man-1.6415333,nottheonion,"An arbitrator has ruled that two police officers in Buffalo, N.Y., didn't violate the department's use-of-force guidelines when they pushed a 75-year-old protester to the ground in June 2020, during racial injustice protests following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

The episode drew national attention when a news crew captured video of Martin Gugino being shoved by officers Robert McCabe and Aaron Torgalski in downtown Buffalo, as crowd control officers in riot gear cleared demonstrators for an 8 p.m. curfew.

Gugino, who was pushed backward, started bleeding after hitting his head on the pavement and spent about a month in hospital with a fractured skull and brain injury.

Buffalo police initially said in a statement that a person ""was injured when he tripped and fell,"" before video of the incident was made public.

In a decision Friday, arbitrator Jeffrey Selchick wrote, ""Upon review, there is no evidence to sustain any claim that Respondents [police officers] had any other viable options other than to move Gugino out of the way of their forward movement.""

The level of force used by the officers was justified because Gugino refused to comply with orders to leave the scene, was acting erratically and walked directly in front of McCabe, according to Selchick.

""The use of force employed by Respondents reflected no intent on their part to do more than to move Gugino away from them,"" he wrote.

McCabe and Torgalski were suspended without pay and arrested within days of the incident, but last year a grand jury declined to indict them and charges were dropped.

A lawyer for Gugino, who has sued the city, told the Buffalo News that the ruling has no bearing on the lawsuit.

""We are not aware of any case where this arbitrator has ruled against on-duty police officers, so his ruling here on behalf of the police was not only expected by us but was certainly expected by the union and city who selected and paid him,"" Melissa Wischerath told the newspaper.

Dutch reforestation company responsible for massive forest fire in Spain,https://nltimes.nl/2022/07/21/dutch-reforestation-company-responsible-massive-forest-fire-spain,nottheonion,"A Dutch company caused a massive forest fire near Saragoza in Spain, the Amsterdam-based reforestation company Land Life said in a press release. According to the company, the fire started on Monday when a spark jumped from an excavator. “Fortunately, no one has been injured,” the company said.

The Land Life workers quickly alerted authorities, but they couldn’t prevent the fire from turning into a massive forest fire. Firefighters are still working to control the fire. According to local broadcaster RTVE, the fire already destroyed some 14,000 hectares of forest and led to over 2,000 evacuations.

Land Life director Francisco Purroy said they are “devastated” by the destruction of scrub, grassland, and pine trees, especially as a company dedicated to restoring degraded land. “We at Land Life are deeply affected by the events and offer our full cooperation to the authorities.”

According to the company, “the reforestation works were carried out in accordance with local regulations and following strict preventive measures to deal with the increased risk due to extreme conditions of drought and heat.”

“We will analyze and investigate what rules and ways of working we can apply,” Purroy said. “For the time being, we are suspending all site preparation in areas with a high risk of wildfire. The safety of local communities and people working on nature restoration is the first priority.”

Authorities closed the A2 highway between Madrid and Zaragoza due to the fire. They also shut down train connections, according to NOS. Javier Lamban, the president of the Aragon region where the fire is raging, called the situation “serious and very worrying” on Thursday."

The girl's dad said from the outside, it looked like a regular box with a toy in it. But once he opened it he found three layers of bags wrapped around a pound of suspected marijuana.

""It did not contain what box said it contained,"" said the girl's dad who did not want to be identified.

The box said inside is slimy paint that transforms into 3D squishy pets. But when the girl opened it, there was no toy inside.

""My daughter's reaction was dad I got scammed I got a bunch of leaves,"" he said.

The dad said it had a potent smell, and he was quite certain it was marijuana.

He called the Spalding County Sheriff's Office.

The gift came from a family friend who bought it at a store in Fayette County called Found Fortunes.

The store buys inventory at government auctions and re-sells it.

Authorities said they don't believe the store had any idea what was in the box, and say it would be impossible to track down where it came from.

Fayette County deputies said this isn't the first time something like this has happened. They said several times a year this business will come across drugs in packages and will turn them in.

The father of the birthday girl said it's definitely a gift they'll remember and wishes investigators could find out who swapped a toy for pot.

""Whoever done it knew what they were doing. I think they need to be stopped. This shouldn't be happening, no child should open this up as a gift,"" he said.

High school music director who replaced a teacher charged with sex crimes against students has been charged with having an inappropriate physical relationship with a student herself,https://policetribune.com/music-teacher-charged-for-sex-crimes-with-student-after-husband-turns-her-in,nottheonion,"Wilmington, PA – A Pennsylvania high school music director who replaced a teacher who had been charged with sex crimes against students has been charged with having an inappropriate physical relationship with a student herself.

The investigation into 26-year-old Olivia Lois Ortz began after her husband, Cody Ortz, returned from a trip to Florida and found correspondence between his wife and a 17-year-old female student on her iPad, the New Castle News reported.

Cody Ortz directed the Wilmington High School musical this year but does not work for the school district.

The criminal complaint said that Cody Ortz reported his wife’s illicit relationship with a student to the school district right after he found out about it, the New Castle News reported.

The school district and Cody Ortz then reported the matter to Childline, and the police were contacted.

Investigators served a search warrant on the Ortz home on May 5 and found text and Spotify messages between the music teacher and the 17-year-old girl, the New Castle News reported.

The criminal complaint said that more than 100 messages had been exchanged between the two on Spotify, and the teacher and student had set up a code word to use if something went wrong or “something bad” happened to either one of them.

The police report said the teen admitted to officers that she had been over to Ortz’s house multiple times while her husband was not home, the New Castle News reported.

She said that had spent the night with the teacher and had multiple romantic, physical encounters with Ortz.

Court records showed the girl told investigators that she slept over at Ortz’s house on April 7, 8, and 9 and they had a sexual relationship.

Police also found out that Ortz had continued communicating with the 17-year-old student even after the warrants had been served at her home, the New Castle News reported.

The girl told investigators that she was in love with Ortz and wanted to offer her support.

The complaint showed the girl told authorities that her father had taken away her cell phone, iPad, and laptop after he found out she was still talking to the woman who had victimized her.

School officials suspended Ortz with pay as soon as they found out about the allegations, the New Castle News reported.

Wilmington Schools Superintendent Dr. Terence P. Meehan said the music teacher resigned her teaching position on May 9.

On Friday, a district judge issued a warrant for Ortz’s arrest, the New Castle News reported.

The former teacher has been charged with unlawful contact with a minor for sexual offenses, criminal use of a communication facility, and two counts of intercourse/sexual contact with a school student.

Ortz remained at large over the weekend and performed in the Shenango Valley Chorale’s 50th anniversary concert on Sunday before turning herself in on Monday afternoon, the New Castle News reported.

Borough Police Chief Carmen Piccirillo said Ortz surrendered on the advice of her attorney and was arraigned by District Judge Rick Russo.

Russo ordered Ortz held in the Lawrence County jail on a $150,000 bond.

She has posted bond and been released, according to the New Castle News.

Disturbingly, Ortz’s predecessor at Wilmington High School was also accused of sexual misconduct with students.

Former band and music teacher 37-year-old Jonathan Priano allegedly had an affinity for tickling female students’ feet and engaged in close personal relationships with several of them, the New Castle News reported.

Priano was ultimately charged with 10 counts of institutional sexual assault, two counts of unlawful contact with minors, 12 counts of corruption of minors, and two counts of endangering the welfare of children.

He is scheduled for trial this summer in the Lawrence County Court of Common Please, the New Castle News reported."
"Florida Gov signs law requiring students, faculty be asked their political beliefs",https://thehill.com/changing-america/enrichment/education/559881-florida-gov-signs-law-requiring-students-and-faculty-be/,nottheonion,"Story at a glance Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) signed HB 233 Tuesday.

The legislation will require public universities to survey students and staff annually about their beliefs to assess “viewpoint diversity” on campuses.

The bill does not specifically say what will be done with survey results, but DeSantis suggested budget cuts could be imminent if universities and colleges are found to be “indoctrinating” students.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) on Tuesday signed legislation mandating public colleges and universities survey students and faculty about their beliefs in an effort to promote intellectual diversity on campuses.

“We obviously want our universities to be focused on critical thinking, academic rigor,” DeSantis said during a news conference Tuesday, according to the Naples Daily News.

“We do not want them as basically hotbeds for stale ideology,” he said.

“It used to be thought that a university campus was a place where you’d be exposed to a lot of different ideas,” DeSantis said. “Unfortunately, now the norm is, these are more intellectually repressive environments,” he added.

Under House Bill 233, surveys would be conducted annually on campuses to assess viewpoint diversity and intellectual freedom, and determine “the extent to which competing ideas and perspectives are presented,” and whether students and faculty “feel free to express beliefs and viewpoints on campus and in the classroom.”

The bill does not specifically say what will be done with survey results, but DeSantis suggested budget cuts could be imminent if universities and colleges are found to be “indoctrinating” students.

“That’s not worth tax dollars and that’s not something that we’re going to be supporting moving forward,” the governor said.

The legislation, which goes into effect July 1, also aims to ensure students are being shown ideas that they “may disagree with or find uncomfortable.”

The measure was among three education bills signed by DeSantis Tuesday. Other measures included an expansion of civics education for K-12 schools, including instruction about the perils of communist and totalitarian governments.

Breastfeeding mum told off because 'no food or drink allowed',https://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/breastfeeding-mum-told-museum-no-7729712,nottheonion,"Something went wrong, please try again later.

A mum has been told off for breastfeeding her son at a museum - because ""no food or drink are allowed"". Fae Church felt ""utterly humiliated"" after being given the cold treatment over feeding her three-month-old child.

It happened during a visit to The University Museum of Zoology in Cambridge on Saturday, October 15. Staff reportedly told the mum “it’s not ok”. Fae, 35, visited the museum with her husband Aaron Church, 35 and their two children; Sophie, five, and Reuben three months old.

The family were meeting Fae’s mum and sister later that day so thought they’d “pop into” the museum beforehand as Sophie had been once before and had really enjoyed it.

They entered at around 4.10pm knowing it closed at 4.30pm and had a quick look around. The University Museum of Zoology is part of the University of Cambridge, it covers two floors and admission is free, CambridgeLive reported.

The family were on the upper floor when their youngest, Reuben started crying and needed feeding.

Fae said: “I said to my husband, you go off with Sophie and look around and I'll just find somewhere quiet in the corner to feed him.”

Fae wanted to find a quiet area to feed her son, so found a little area next to a Komodo dragon skeleton at the museum where there was a corner, a pillar and a chair.

She grabbed the chair and put it around the side because “there was someone near it at the time” and said she ""went around the other side away from them.

“I positioned myself with the pillar to my back and my buggy in front of me to act as a screen, I try and be as private as I possibly can with it and so I sat there” she added.

The mum said she sat there “quite happily” breastfeeding Reuben for around five minutes. She had a jacket on, and a scarf over the top with the buggy in front, a few people walked past but the mum said: “they didn’t pay any attention to me they were looking at the exhibits.”

After Fae had finished breastfeeding she started to wind her three-month-old son but said she noticed a woman who worked at the museum walk past and claims she gave her a “sort of funny sideways glance”.

Fae engaged with the woman and said: “I hope you don't mind, I just made this my breastfeeding corner”.

Fae continued: “There was a sort of silence and she looked at me again and she went ‘actually no, it’s not ok because no food and drink are allowed to be consumed in the museum’.

“I stared at her, my jaw slightly went open and I didn’t know what to say, she then said ‘there is a café upstairs, you should have gone there’.”

Describing how this felt the mum said: “I felt utterly humiliated like a little girl at school, just getting told off, I didn't know what to say”.

After this encounter, Fae said she replied to the guide saying: “Oh well he’s finished feeding now anyway”.

Fae claims the guide looked at her again and then walked off. Fae said she was left “absolutely stunned”, adding that she has breastfed both her children and this was the first time she has received anything negative towards breastfeeding in public. Fae added: “especially from a woman, I found it quite shocking.

“She seemed disgruntled with me. It was just bizarre and it left me really shaken up.”

When husband, Aaron came back with daughter Sophie, Fae explained what had happened.

They were going to speak with the woman again but couldn’t find her, and as they were in a rush to meet Fae’s mum and sister they didn’t have time to report the incident to another member of staff on the day.

Explaining how she felt for the rest of the day Fae said: “I was absolutely shaken by it, I just couldn't believe it. She was making me feel humiliated by it. I did just feel about three inches high in that moment, it wasn't nice.”

The mum also said: “It was the way she said it, there wasn't any kindness from her comments. Most people would have helped me, because I had a big buggy with me and you have your baby in your arms, it's difficult finding places to breastfeed.

“And I’ve never been to the café upstairs, I didn’t know if it was open or how to get to it. With a baby crying you just go and find an area as quick as you possibly can to settle them.

“If she had come over and said ‘there's a nice area here or I can help you go there’, that would have been perfectly normal and a kind thing to do.”

The mum of two adds: “Breastfeeding, it's hard and exhausting and you have to really persevere to do it, just generally, that alone being made to feel like you shouldn't be doing it when you’re out and about.

We should all be supporting each other, especially as a woman, she should support me to be doing something that's natural, and the best thing I can possibly do for my child, it’s quite shameful behaviour.”

The University Museum of Zoology states on its website under the ‘visiting with families’ section “Breastfeeding and bottle feeding is welcomed in all Museum spaces”.

In a response to this a spokesperson for The University Museum of Zoology said: “On behalf of all the staff and volunteers at the Museum of Zoology we can only apologise wholeheartedly for what happened to Fae and the way she was made to feel. We absolutely allow and welcome breastfeeding and bottle-feeding in all our public spaces.

""We pride ourselves on being a family-friendly museum and it’s terrible that a visitor was treated in this manner. The volunteer she spoke to made an unfortunate mistake, one which is not reflective of our culture or policy.

“As soon as we were made aware of what had happened, we shared it with the whole volunteer and staff team. We’ve ensured that they know how important it is that visitors should feel comfortable breastfeeding and bottle-feeding in the Museum, to avoid visitors being left feeling the way she has been, with some specific pointers about how they can support parents who ask about quieter spots they can use.

""We will also be more specific about this in inductions for new volunteers working in the galleries.

""Our visitor engagement volunteers are typically an incredibly supportive team, helping people get the most out of their visits – it’s so unusual that things go wrong in the way they have here. We are hopeful that with these extra communications, events like this won’t happen again.”

According to Nashville Police, Darius Dugas, 27, Sashondre Dugas, 32, Christopher Alton, 27, and Ladesion Riley, 30, were all arrested after checking out of a motel in Dickson, TN.

RELATED: Video shows robbery suspect with knife at west Houston ATM

Riley, who uses a stage name on YouTube, recently shared a music video called ""Make it Home"". In the video, Riley raps about frequently robbing ATMs out of state. The lyrics describe having thousands of dollars in their vehicle, praying to avoid the chase, and to make it home.

""If you’re going to rap about it, then turn around and be about it and get caught, that’s on you,"" said Douglas Griffith, President of the Houston Police Officers’ Union. ""You shouldn’t do stupid crap, and you definitely shouldn’t violate the law and talk about it.""

Authorities say the four Texans approached an ATM technician from behind and told him to not do anything stupid and to hand over the money. Later that day, Nashville Police, Dickson Police, the Tennessee Highway Patrol, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Violent Crimes Task Force, tracked down and arrested the four individuals.

MORE CRIME AND PUBLIC SAFETY

Online criminal records reveal at least two of the suspects were out of jail on felony bonds and had been previously arrested several times.

""Convicted felons doing their music videos with guns,"" said Griffith. ""How dumb is that? That right there is enough for them to get charged again.""

Riley’s stage name involves the words ""Jug God."" It’s unknown, but this could be in reference to jugging. Jugging is when burglars follow unsuspecting victims home from banks, malls, or restaurants to steal.

""They want to glorify the fact that they’re criminals,"" said Griffith. ""That saddens me because we have all of these kids watching this, and they’re glorifying it, and these kids look up to them. It’s dumb. These guys are dumb. They deserve to be tossed into jail just for being dumb.""

The Trucker Convoy Will Leave DC Without Accomplishing Anything,https://www.washingtonian.com/2022/03/28/trucker-convoy-will-leave-dc-without-accomplishing-anything/,nottheonion,"The “People’s Convoy” that’s been parked in Hagerstown for weeks will finally leave the Washington region alone, Zachary Petrizzo reported for the Daily Beast Sunday night. Its numbers had dwindled, authorities mostly prevented them from causing any substantial havoc in DC itself, and it was never clear what they hoped to accomplish besides annoying area residents. Locals flipped them off on the highway, yelled at them to go home, and in one case brought an expedition into DC to a crawl by using only a single bicycle. As they got more frustrated with their directionless protest, some convoy participants reportedly got violent; others complained that by closing exits on the highway, authorities were causing them to pee in their pants.

Amanda Moore researches the far right in the US and spent a year undercover in MAGA world. As a DC resident, she says she had little choice but to pay attention to this trucker convoy, which she covers on her Twitter account and via her Substack: “It’s literally inconveniencing my life,” she says. “If this trucker convoy was in Los Angeles or Houston, I probably wouldn’t have spent too much time watching it. But like, I walk out of my office and I run into one of these dipshits.”

Washingtonian spoke to Moore about what the convoy might have wanted—it now claims to be headed back to California to oppose legislation there—and how its vague plans went awry. Here are a few lessons we gleaned:

The protests weren’t as important as the community they built

The Hagerstown Speedway became a mini-village of anti-government protesters during the convoy’s residency. Jared Holt, a resident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab who studies the far right, called it a “a sort of Gathering of the Juggalos for grandparents and uncles who’ve had their brains turned to taffy by Facebook.” Moore describes it as “like going to Coachella, but awful” and says that based on her own observations, which involved watching hours of livestreams the convoy people blasted out, “there’s a lot of people in that community whose political beliefs made them quite lonely within their own family unit.”

Still, cracks appeared. People became restless at making drives to DC each day, and sporadic cold and wet weather didn’t help their worsening moods. “They didn’t sign up to be at the Hagerstown protest,” she says. “They signed up to be at the DC protest.” Organizers insisted all along that the convoy wouldn’t go into DC, but many wanted to spend more time in town to make their points—whatever those were—and to do a little sightseeing. On livestreams, “some of the days are just people, like, walking around the cherry blossoms.”

They thought DC area residents were evil. Or brainwashed. Or maybe both

Convoy members’ initial dismay at not being welcomed by DC-area residents hardened into harebrained ideas about conducting “citizen’s arrests” or reclaiming Black Lives Matter Plaza. “I’ve heard ‘These people are evil.’ ‘These people are brainwashed,'” Moore says. “If anybody looks at them wrong, they’re like, Oh, this person is a federal agent or this person is Antifa, as if the only people who can not want you honking as you drive through a residential neighborhood are Antifa activists, right?” The film The Manchurian Candidate wouldn’t have made any sense from a plot perspective, Washingtonian ventured to Moore, if brainwashed people could also be evil. “That’s the tagline of the whole convoy,” she replied. “It doesn’t make any sense from a plot perspective.”

To the extent that the convoy had any coherent demands, Moore says, look at the pro-Trump and anti-Biden flags with which they festooned their vehicles. “Their concern is an overthrow of democracy and undermining the electoral process in the country,” she says. Their frequent expressions of admiration for January 6 prisoners were another tell.

Few if any of the convoy participants understood that DC residents have no say in what happens in Congress. Most had no idea DC’s vaccine and mask mandates—one purported reason for their protests—ended before they arrived. “I think they’re a little surprised by everything,” Moore says. “These are people who are like, ‘Oh, what is the building?’ And it’s the Capitol. They’ll get messages about Clarence Thomas, and someone will explain he’s a Supreme Court justice. It’s like, you’ve dedicated your whole identity to like politics in America, and you don’t know who’s on the Supreme Court and you don’t know what building you’re standing in front of?”

Some wanted to do a lot more than drive around

After their initial idea to circle the Beltway failed to make much of an impression on Washingtonians, some convoy people found a little more purchase by rolling up 395, while others made it into town. “They were very energized by the first couple of days of causing four-hour delays for people,” Moore says, leading some participants to campaign that they should “keep re-creating that.” So why didn’t they? “I personally speculate they must have been losing numbers. Just because I think they would keep doing that if they could.” Others wanted to break up groups and “try to enter DC from all different angles.” These plans, too, she says, suffered from the same “lack of cohesion” and the fact that “everybody has a different comfort level.”

The concern of lots of people who thought going into DC would be a “trap” melted after they made it in and saw no jackbooted thugs ready to whisk them off to the DC Jail, like the January 6 prisoners. Some nevertheless took comical precautions, like covering up their license plates or the Department of Transportation numbers they’re required to display on their vehicles. Moore and others reported some of those scofflaws to DOT, which she says was “receptive” when she called but hadn’t taken any action yet.

Their leaders got sloppy

Convoy leader organizer Brian Brase, who helped get convoy members face time with GOP members of Congress, said this weekend he would have stormed the Capitol on January 6, a strong counterargument to his already shaky claims that the convoy was a bipartisan protest. Brase went home on Sunday, as he did the previous weekend. “Trucker G,” another convoy leader, had split, too, Moore says, leading to more discord. “ Everybody really respects Trucker G, even people who hate each other,” she says. “He’s the one person trying to calm everyone down.” With their leaders AWOL, the privations of Hagerstown were bound to get people thinking fondly of home: “Morale is down,” she says. “They’re probably tired. They’re probably smelly. And they’re out of money.” Questions about what happened to the million-plus dollars the convoy raised can’t help. “They don’t see they’re accomplishing anything,” Moore says. “Why not get back on the road?”

A Nebraska man hired by a local charity to simulate a mass shooting has been charged with making terroristic threats.

The Omaha World-Herald reported that John Channels was advised by Catholic Charities, an organization with branches across the US, to make the drill realistic — which he did, complete with paid actors covered in blood.

Unfortunately, the simulation caused chaos among employees who thought the shooting was real. The news outlet reported that bloodied actors laid in hallways throughout the office building. One employee told the World-Herald she heard shots behind her and jumped off a retaining wall to try and hide in a dumpster.

The incident, which occurred on May 19, 2022, began with Channels firing at a conference room window of the office building in which employees happened to be gathered, according to the news outlet.

One elderly employee told police she thought she was going to die. ""This is it,"" she told the World-Herald.

Channels' lawyer, Erin Wetzel, told the publication that Catholic Charities requested the 27-year-old conduct the drill in that specific manner. ""It's important to note that several of (the directors) went along with it, and while it was happening, they were not informing employees of what was going on, even as they were asking,"" Wetzel said.

Omaha Catholic Charities' executive director, Denise Bartels, said in a statement that the group hired Channels ""based upon recommendations from respected sources, and he clearly misrepresented himself and his qualifications.""

Channels' LinkedIn page states he's a police officer for the Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska and that he's also the CEO of a security firm called Exousia Protection Agency. Neither organization responded to Insider's requests for comment.

The Daily Beast reported law enforcement said they weren't alerted to the drill and responded as if it were an active crime scene. Don Kleine, the attorney for Douglas County told the news outlet that ""police came, they didn't know this was happening. They thought it was a real active shooter. There were people calling 911.""

Local news station KMTV reported that Channels identified himself to police as an Offutt Civilian Police Officer.

On Tuesday, Channels was arrested and charged with five counts of making terroristic threats and one weapons count, according to the World-Herald.

This isn't Channels' only run-in with the law. In May, he was arrested and charged with three felonies which included first-degree sexual assault of a child, visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct of a child, and attempted intentional child abuse. It's unclear if the charity knew of his prior charges.

Catholic Charities, Erin Wetzel, the Douglas County Attorney's Office, and the Omaha police department did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment."
"Flagstaff PD officers fully naked, fondled during massage investigation",https://www.abc15.com/news/local-news/investigations/flagstaff-pd-officers-fully-naked-fondled-during-massage-investigation,nottheonion,"*This story contains graphic details and may not be suitable for all readers*

Two Flagstaff police officers went undercover to massage parlors, took their pants off, and allowed themselves to be fondled at least five different times each.

Experts tell ABC15 that state law clearly outlines that as illegal. The operation, though, was approved by federal agents, Coconino County prosecutors and Flagstaff’s command staff.

Federal agents called it “Operation High Country Hydra.”

In 2019, a tip was called in about Flagstaff massage parlors accepting money for sex acts.

Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and Flagstaff PD launched a joint months-long investigation to try and stop the suspected “human trafficking, sex trafficking and prostitution.”

When the investigation was complete, not a single trafficking victim had been identified.

Police arrested 13 people though, after two officers went undercover and got completely naked.

“I didn't know where to stop it.”

Officer Dustin Eberhardt remembers the 'confusion' from his first undercover massage.

“I was like, ‘Well, do you want me to take them off?’ And so she was like, ‘Well, your comfort – if you want them off or you don't want oil on them.’ There was kind of some confusion on that, so I ended up taking them off because that's what I felt like the suggestion was from her,” recalled Eberhardt in a video deposition.

The Flagstaff officer went on to explain that he tried to minimize the amount of time the massage parlor employee was fondling his exposed genitals.

“As soon as I got aroused, that's when I immediately started asking about the money and how much. And like I said, I've never done one of these, so I was fairly nervous and I didn't know where to stop it. So I was trying to stop it quickly.”

Police reports reveal Officer Eberhardt allowed different women to touch him seven more times over the next 48 hours.

Roughly three months later, another Flagstaff police employee, Officer Hutchinson, went back into five of the same massage parlors and did the same thing. The reason for the second round of sexual contact was to see if the businesses would accept debit cards.

Both men documented every instance of sexual contact with a recording device, and in detailed reports.

Also, Officer Eberhardt’s initial ‘confusion’ about ‘where to stop’ may come as a surprise - since the operation had been in the works for months, and the ‘fondling’ was discussed and approved ahead of time by prosecutors, police department leaders and federal agents.

“You cannot exchange money for sex acts while on duty. It is a crime.”

Defense attorneys, trafficking experts and even other law enforcement tell ABC15 there are a litany of issues with how this operation was conducted.

For starters, state law clearly outlines that what the officers detailed in their reports is illegal.

Second, experts say the fondling was not necessary for police and prosecutors to pursue prostitution charges.

Third, investigators repeatedly said they were looking into ‘sex trafficking’ and then proceeded to pay for sex acts from potential victims.

“So the officer[s] in this case could be charged with trafficking and they are not,” said Brad Rideout , an Arizona defense attorney and former prosecutor, who has handled hundreds of prostitution cases in his career.

Rideout is not involved in any way with this case. He did represent a woman charged in a similar, 2018 HSI operation in neighboring Mohave County.

Agents called that investigation ‘ Operation Asian Touch'.

The Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at ASU’s Cronkite School reported how those cases were dismissed by the county attorney, because HSI did not cooperate with the prosecution.

“In Arizona, you cannot exchange money for sex acts while on duty. It is a crime,” said Rideout.

He is referring to state statute 13-1412 :

“A peace officer commits unlawful sexual conduct by knowingly engaging in sexual contact…with any person who is in the officer's custody or…the subject of an investigation.”

Flagstaff Police Chief Dan Musselman told ABC15 his employee did not violate state law because the officer did not sexually touch the masseuse.

State law does not differentiate the touching. It just states ‘engaging in sexual contact’ is illegal.

“...Making him the victim…”

In an emailed response to questions, Chief Musselman also went a step further in the defense of his officer’s actions.

“Quite the opposite happened, the subject fondled Officer Eberhardt thereby making him the victim of Sexual Abuse under 13-1404. ”

The statute the chief references stipulates abuse only occurs ‘without consent.’

The officer, who the chief says is the victim, staked out the eight parlors, walked into each one with a recording device, paid cash, rolled over and took off his boxers.

Officer Eberhardt also said he helped initiate the process.

“So I had just put my hand on the back of her calf and then held it there and then she laughed about it. And then shortly after that, we did the rest of the stuff and then she had me roll over,” said Eberhardt in the deposition.

In his reports, Eberhardt repeatedly mentioned how when he “placed [his] hand on the back of the female’s calf…[it] appeared to let them know I was okay to solicit sexual favors.”

On July 15-16, 2019, Flagstaff PD and HSI sent Eberhardt into eight massage parlors. The evidence gathered led the Coconino County Attorney’s Office to indict 13 people. Prosecutors indicated to the grand jury that they focused on the owners or operators of the massage businesses. There was almost no mention of any lower-level employees who may have been ‘trafficked’ inside the parlors.

Defendants are charged with a mix of ‘conspiracy, money laundering, and operating a house of prostitution.’

“They should have known better.”

“I don't know how you can continue to prosecute a case in which you know that there's a strong possibility that this officer has committed some sort of crime,” said Jack Litwak .

Litwak is a Phoenix defense attorney representing one of the female defendants.

Like many lawyers involved in these cases, he was shocked Flagstaff PD and HSI used an investigative technique he says has been widely condemned.

“They do not need to do that…And frankly, they should have known better,” said Litwak. “There's a statute that specifically prohibits it. You are not allowed to re-victimize potential victims.”

Other attorneys agree the alleged criminal conduct could have been gathered without the officers engaging in sexual touching.

“There are cases where undercover officers will go to the point of getting there with contact, but stopping,” said Michael Wozniak , a Flagstaff defense attorney not involved in this case.

Like Rideout, Wozniak briefly represented a defendant arrested in HSI’s Mohave County sting.

“I frankly think these cases can be made without going through the acts,” said Wozniak.

Many Valley departments have brought charges against illicit massage parlor employees and owners without any nudity or touching occurring.

In his response to written questions though, Chief Musselman said, “It was necessary for there to be direct fondling before to have proof sufficient to determine where sex acts were being officered [sic] for money.”

In Arizona, prostitution is defined as “...engaging in or agreeing or offering to engage in sexual conduct under a fee arrangement…”

ABC15 asked Chief Musselman: “Why was the negotiation (re: prices and services) not done before the officer rolled over, took off his boxers, and allowed himself to be sexually touched?”

He replied via email:

“When conducting undercover investigations it is vital to ensure that any offers to participate in prostitution originate from the person who is under investigation and not from the undercover officer. Therefore officers entered the establishments under the auspices to obtain a legitimate legal massage and waited to see if the individuals in this establishment would offer to participate in sex acts for money. There was an additional concern of potential language barriers that could prevent the officers from just asking for the sex acts for money without the fondling taking place.”

“A far overstep into abuse of power…”

Trafficking experts and victim advocates have expressed dismay and outrage when hearing about the operation.

“The sex act doesn't have to happen. So for me, this is a far overstep into abuse of power, and raises some really disturbing ethical issues,” said Jenna Panas, CEO of Arizona Coalition to End Sexual and Domestic Violence.

Panas, who has done extensive work with trafficked women, said law enforcement has an obligation to ensure people are not forced to continue performing sexual acts against their will.

“You don't ask victims to give you sexual pleasure. That is not appropriate,” said Panas. “These are folks who don't have power and control over their own lives, and do not have the ability to give consent…and our police solicited sex acts.”

Chief Musselman said when his officers are gathering evidence they “are in a position to engage in what would otherwise be considered illegal activity.”

He mentioned two examples of officers violating “speed limits to catch drivers who are possibly under the influence of drugs” and taking illegal drugs into their possession, which he said is “technically in violation of the law (Possession of Drugs).”

Panas and Rideout say that is the wrong viewpoint for law enforcement to take in these investigations.

“Women who work in massage parlors are not a commodity, there are people,” said Rideout. “They need to be treated like domestic violence victims, not drugs.”

“For the police department to go in expecting to see sex trafficking and pursuing in this way is surprising,” said Panas. “Because this operation looks like they’re just looking for a way to prosecute, as opposed to a way to help the victims.”

In documents, officers and agents repeatedly mention ‘human and sex trafficking’ as a primary focus of the investigation.

Law enforcement even contracted with victim advocates before they made the arrests.

In a report, one officer wrote that they knew “there would be a good likelihood that we would encounter someone who was at the parlor against their will.”

But in their reports, that concern for possible victims only appears after Officers Eberhardt and Hutchinson take off their clothes.

Investigators never determined ahead of time – are the women we are about to pay to touch city employees potentially trafficking victims?

“If you're engaging eight separate times and to try and have sex with victims, you are engaged in trafficking,” said Rideout. “So the officer[s] in this case could be charged with trafficking and they are not.”

Prosecutors and Federal Agents

ABC15 also sent detailed questions to the Coconino County Attorney’s Office, asking about their role in the investigation. The county attorney and four of his top prosecutors, involved in these cases, never responded.

Public court databases show at least two cases have already been dismissed.

On Thursday, July 7 attorneys representing three more defendants told ABC15 their cases were ‘dismissed with prejudice.’

At last check, online court records show three defendants are still being prosecuted.

Of the other 13 people initially indicted, it appears some of the women were never located or arrested, so there is no active prosecution.

ABC15 sent Homeland Security Investigations, a division of ICE, five specific questions regarding their involvement in this operation. They only sent the following statement:

“Every day, HSI special agents around the globe work to uncover, dismantle and disrupt human trafficking. HSI employs a victim-centered approach, where the greatest value is placed on the identification and stabilization of victims, as we pursue the investigation and prosecution of traffickers. Across the state, HSI stands proudly next to our local law enforcement partners to not only identify and assist victims, but to prosecute offenders and prevent additional trafficking.

Throughout Arizona, HSI has conducted hundreds of trainings and outreach presentations to educate the public, businesses and other law enforcement agencies in identifying human trafficking indicators and will continue to focus and prioritize the potential victims as we conduct human trafficking investigations in Arizona.

Due to operational security and officer considerations, the agency does not discuss investigative techniques or comment on internal deliberations related to cases.”

What’s Next

ABC15 is going to continue to report on this operation.

State treasurer candidate says bankruptcies make him a better candidate,https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2022/mar/27/state-treasurer-candidate-says-bankruptcies-make/,nottheonion,"Arkansas state treasurer candidate Mark Lowery has filed for personal bankruptcy twice, in 1998 and in 2017, according to federal court records.

Lowery is a Republican state representative from Maumelle who announced his bid for treasurer in January after several months of campaigning for secretary of state.

He filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in May 1998, which under federal law provides for the sale of a debtor's nonexempt property and the distribution of the proceeds to creditors, also known as liquidation. The case was closed later the same year, documents show.

In 2017, he filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which provides for adjustment of debts of an individual with regular income and allows for the individual to keep property and pay debts over time, and is still in the process of paying about $68,000 worth of debts, according to the most recent filings.

Lowery's primary opponent, state Sen. Mat Pitsch, R-Fort Smith, said Lowery's financial history doesn't bode well for his ability to do the job of the state's banker. The state treasurer is responsible for an investment portfolio of more than $5 billion, according to the current officeholder's website.

""I understand it happening once, but if it happens repeatedly that shows what your financial skills are,"" Pitsch said by phone Friday. ""You couldn't have those credentials and still be a bank president.""

Lowery said in an interview Thursday that the state treasurer's office has financial advisers and investment personnel, and that he wouldn't have a problem working with a strong staff. He added that his own setbacks allow him to empathize with constituents.

""Do I believe all the personal financial issues I have make me a better candidate? Yes. Because when they tell me, when Arkansans tell me they're having difficulty, I understand it. And I understand that sometimes those things happen through no direct fault of their own,"" he said.

Local media outlets KATV and the Arkansas Times were the first to report on the 2017 filing earlier this year.

When asked by KATV reporter Marine Glisovic in February how many times he had filed for bankruptcy, Lowery responded he had filed once, according to her report. When asked about that answer by the Democrat-Gazette last week, he said he had forgotten about the 1998 filing.

Lowery said his only debt in that case was on a car, which he ended up turning back to the bank. He said his income for the past two years had been managing a golf course property at the North Little Rock Veterans Affairs Hospital at Fort Roots and had expected to have the opportunity for a long-term lease that was instead awarded to the city of North Little Rock.

Lowery said it took him a few months to secure employment that would have put him in a better position to keep the car.

Regarding the February 2017 filing, Lowery said he had entered into a short-term loan modification agreement with the company Nationstar Mortgage to get a lower rate.

Court records show Lowery sued Nationstar in February 2017, before his home was set to be auctioned at a foreclosure sale, for not providing him with notice that he did not meet the criteria for loan modification or forbearance assistance.

In the suit, Lowery said he had made payments on the mortgage but the company began rejecting them in fall 2016. An attorney for Nationstar denied the allegations in Lowery's complaint, according to court documents. Lowery's attorney ultimately moved for the case to be dismissed. Lowery said Thursday he was unable to get a hearing before a judge and said he was in danger of losing his home.

""Running out of time, the only recourse I had was to file bankruptcy,"" he said.

He also referenced a class-action lawsuit against Nationstar alleging the company violated consumer protection laws, which resulted in a settlement in 2020. Lowery was not a party in that lawsuit.

Lowery is under a 60-month plan to pay a total of $67,556, according to court documents from 2019.

The 2017 filing includes nearly $8,000 worth of credit card debt across various cards, among other charges.

""It's not out of the ordinary to have credit card debt, but again, all of that is under reorganization and everyone's getting paid,"" he said.

Lowery also was sued by the state Department of Finance and Administration over about $1,300 in unpaid individual income taxes in 2016 and 2017. He said that case arose due to having incomplete information on his mortgage deduction. The case was resolved in 2020, records show.

The Republican primary is scheduled for May 24. The winner will face Democrat Pam Whitaker of Little Rock in the Nov. 8 general election. Incumbent state Treasurer Dennis Milligan is term-limited and is running for state auditor."

A wealthy town in Silicon Valley has declared itself a ""mountain-lion habitat"" to halt new affordable-housing projects in the area.

The state's new law, known as Senate Bill 9, allows up to four housing units to be built in a single-family lot, but Woodside, California, blocked the building of new housing projects.

In a January 27 memo, the town declared that all housing projects started under SB 9 would be indefinitely paused as of January 25 after a petition to consider Woodside a habitat for mountain lions — a species that is a candidate to be considered endangered in the state — was brought before the town council.

The town council was able to identify a clause in SB 9 that prohibits building on ""land identified as habitat for protected species,"" according to the memo.

""Given that Woodside — in its entirety — is habitat for a candidate species, no parcel within Woodside is currently eligible for an SB 9 project,"" the memo said.

The town's mayor, Dick Brown, told The Almanac that it was ""not the Woodside way"" to prioritize housing over a habitat for endangered species.

""We love animals,"" he said. ""Every house that's built is one more acre taken away from [mountain lions'] habitat. Where are they going to go? Pretty soon, we'll have nothing but asphalt and no animals or birds.""

He added that the town was looking for alternative options for affordable housing.

Ken Paglia, a spokesperson for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, confirmed to Insider on Thursday that ""mountain lions can and do use a lot of the area immediately adjacent to Woodside."" Paglia said that since mountain lions could become an endangered species, they would be ""treated as if it's listed until the final decision has been made, so the undeveloped lands in and around Woodside would be considered mountain lion habitat.""

But Paglia said it was up to the California Fish and Game Commission to determine whether the area was an ""evolutionarily significant unit"" (ESU).

The petition has been presented to the commission, but he said the panel had yet to make a ruling on whether it considered Woodside an ESU for mountain lions — a decision that will officially determine whether the town is a territory for the species.

""California Dept. of Fish and Wildlife is working on a status review for mountain lions and will make a recommendation to the California Fish and Game Commission at some point, probably later this year,"" Paglia told Insider. ""Then the Commission will vote on whether or not to list mountain lions as a candidate species under [the California Endangered Species Act] within the ESU."""

In the clip, the pilot told passengers to 'quit sending naked pictures' or vacation would be ruined.

Cyberflashing isn't a new problem, and legislators are working to criminalize the act.

A Southwest Airlines pilot piloting a plane to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, threatened to turn the plane around and involve security if a passenger didn't stop sending unsolicited AirDropped nudes.

An August 25 TikTok chronicling the incident was uploaded by user Teighlor Marsalis (@teighmars) and has since been viewed more than 2 million times.

""So here's the deal,"" the pilot said over the intercom. ""If this continues while we're on the ground, I'm going to have to pull back to the gate, everybody's going to have to get off, we're going to have to get security involved, and [your] vacation is going to be ruined,""

""Whatever that AirDrop thing is — quit sending naked pictures, let's get yourself to Cabo,"" he continued.

The incident reportedly happened before the plane was airborne when a passenger received the explicit image and complained to a flight attendant. Marsalis, who told Insider via Instagram direct message she thought the pilot handled the situation ""perfectly,"" said she also received an AirDrop request but denied it.

In a statement provided to Insider, Southwest Airlines said the safety, security, and wellbeing of customers and employees was its ""highest priority at all times. When made aware of a potential problem, our employees address issues to support the comfort of those traveling with us.""

Cyberflashing, the practice of sending unsolicited and explicit photos to nearby strangers, is not a new problem. In a 2017 Pew Research Center report, 53% of women ages 18-29 reported having been sent unsolicited obscene images (compared to 37% of men within the same range). A 2021 report found that 33% of women under 35 reported having been sexually harassed online in general — three times more often than men within the same age range.

Cyberflashing is already considered a misdemeanor in Texas after legislators teamed up with dating app Bumble in 2019 to criminalize it. In California, a new bill sent to Gov. Gavin Newsom on August 22 would give unsuspecting recipients the ability to sue the senders if they're older than 18.

""Just as individuals suffer sexual harassment and abuse in their physical, non-digital lives,"" Assemblymember Cecilia Aguiar-Curry said when the California Assembly approved the bill, ""there's a growing incidence of individuals being harassed by receiving unsolicited, sexually explicit images and videos including from people they do not know."""

A university in Shanghai has sparked ridicule after it moved its mandatory swimming test for students ""online"" in response to the city's Covid outbreaks.

Last week, Shanghai University said that students who had yet to complete a 50-meter (164 feet) swimming test before graduating could do so ""online"" from home.

The move was made to ""ensure that the graduation process proceeds smoothly"" amid Shanghai's Covid outbreaks, the school said on its website in a now-deleted notice that was screengrabbed and widely circulated over social media.

According to South China Morning Post, students at some of China's top universities are required to master swimming as it is considered an essential survival skill.

To pass the swimming requirement this year, students must fill out an online ""Basic Theory of Swimming"" test by May 29, the notice said.

News of the announcement immediately sparked ridicule after going viral, with the hashtag ""Shanghai University swimming test changed to online assessment"" receiving more than 120 million views on China's Twitter-like Weibo platform.

""This is just embarrassing, coming from a reputable university. How can a theory test be the same as an actual lap in the pool?"" one Weibo user commented.

""Are the students supposed to swim in their bathtubs?"" another person said.

Many users also shared videos of themselves pretending to swim in their rooms as a joke submission for the test. One user's video, for example, showed him ""diving"" into his bed and ""swimming,"" complete with goggles and a swim cap.

Even though the number of new Covid cases has fallen in recent days, millions of residents in Shanghai continue to be stuck in lockdown, per South China Morning Post. However, according to the outlet, authorities are due to officially lift the city's two-month-long lockdown on June 1."

Stewart, 77, whose raspy voice has produced 16 Top-10 hits in the U.S. and four No. 1 singles, shared videos on Instagram showing him shoveling gravel into potholes near his home in Harlow, England, ITV reported.

The singer wore a bright yellow vest as he pitched in.

“’m repairing the street where I live as no one can be bothered to do it,” Stewart said in the video. “This is the state of the road near where I live in Harlow and it’s been like this for ages.

“People are bashing their cars up,” Stewart continued. The other day, there was an ambulance with a burst tire. My Ferrari can’t go through here at all. So me and the boys thought we would come and do it ourselves. We are filling the holes while millions and millions of pounds have been spent on the M11.”

Stewart was knighted at Buckingham Palace, in 2016, the BBC reported. The singer, a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, released his latest album, “The Tears Of Hercules,” in 2021, according to ITV.

A spokesperson for Essex Highways said the agency appreciated Stewart’s enthusiasm but preferred that Rod the Mod let professionals do the work.

“While we appreciate Sir Rod’s commitment to improving his community, we would discourage anyone from doing work on the roads themselves, because, without proper traffic management and other specific safety measures, residents are putting themselves at risk,” the spokesperson told ITV in a statement.

Clarence Thomas rips media: I'll leave my job when I do it as poorly as you do yours,https://www.foxnews.com/media/justice-clarence-thomas-blasts-critics-liberal-media,nottheonion,"U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas ripped into his critics in the liberal media on Friday, prompting roars of laughter from a Dallas audience.

Thomas has been the subject of scrutiny from progressive reporters and pundits on numerous occasions.

In February, the Washington Post was forced to issue a ""clarification"" after a news article said that Thomas’ thinking was similar to that of a ""White conservative."" They updated the piece to note his thoughts were similar to that of conservatives, rather than White conservatives, specifically.

In another notable example, MSNBC host Joy Reid sparked outrage after she called Thomas ""Uncle Clarence,"" an unsubtle reference to the ""Uncle Tom"" slur, during the 2020 election night coverage.

CLARENCE THOMAS SAYS 'TREMENDOUSLY BAD' ABORTION DRAFT LEAK CHANGED THE SUPREME COURT 'FOREVER'

""I think what scares people is that if [Trump] decides to do something that legally makes no sense... but if they somehow manage to stumble into the Supreme Court, do any of you guys trust Uncle Clarence and Amy Coney Barrett and those guys to actually follow the letter of the law?"" she asked.

Reid has also used the ""Uncle Clarence"" phrase on more than one occasion on Twitter.

ABC’s ""The View,"" CNN, The Boston Globe and numerous other media organizations have ridiculed Thomas, often referencing his race in the process.

On Friday, during a discussion on racial inequality and the Supreme Court at the Old Park conference, Thomas decided to hit back on his critics in the media.

""One of the things I’d say in response to the media is when they talk about, especially early on, about the way I did my job, I said ‘I will absolutely leave the court when I do my job as poorly as you do yours—and that was meant as a compliment really,"" Thomas said, as the audience, and forme Bush administration official John C. Yoo burst out laughing.

LEFTISTS RESPOND AFTER JUSTICE CLARENCE THOMAS SAYS COURT WON’T BE ‘BULLIED’: ‘BULLY THEM HARDER’

""It really is good to be me—it really is,"" Thomas added moments later.

Thomas has been outspoken since a leaked draft opinion on Roe v Wade came to light earlier this month. On May 14, the same day Thomas made his comments on C-SPAN, the Supreme Court justice said that the leak has fundamentally altered the judicial body.

""I do think that what happened at the court is tremendously bad... I wonder how long we’re going to have these institutions at the rate we’re undermining them,"" Thomas said.

WHO warns people not to attack monkeys amid monkeypox outbreak,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/who-warns-do-not-attack-monkeys-monkeypox-rcna42433,nottheonion,"The World Health Organization is urging the public not to attack monkeys amid the monkeypox outbreak, following reports that primates have been poisoned and killed in Brazil.

""What people need to know is that the transmission we are seeing is happening between humans,"" WHO spokesperson Dr. Margaret Harris said Tuesday at a press briefing in Geneva.

At least 10 monkeys in Brazil, a combination of marmosets and capuchins, were rescued showing signs of intoxication or having been harmed, the Brazilian news outlet G1 reported Sunday. Seven of them died and the others were being monitored at a zoo in São José do Rio Preto, in the state of São Paolo.

The Environmental Military Police in Brazil believe the poisonings were perpetrated by people, out of a fear of monkeypox, G1 reported. In response, the police have reinforced patrolling in woods. Civil police in Brazil, meanwhile, are investigating whether the cases are criminal. Some of the animals' organs are also being studied to determine their cause of death, according to G1.

The WHO declared monkeypox a public health emergency of international concern last month. Nearly 32,000 cases globally have been reported this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

""The concern should be about where it's transmitting in the human population and what humans can do to protect themselves from getting it and transmitting it,"" Harris said. ""They should certainly not be attacking any animals.""

The recent reports of attacks on monkeys are not the only ones in Brazil, according to Dener Giovanini, the coordinator of an organization called Renctas, an acronym for the National Network to Combat Wildlife Trafficking. He told NBC News that monkeys in various parts of Brazil have been poisoned, stoned or shot to death.

""The name chosen for this new disease is very unfortunate. Many people in Brazil believe that monkeys carry the disease and are persecuting these animals,"" Giovanini said, adding, ""We are very concerned because this represents a huge threat to wild animals in Brazil, which are already very endangered.""

Monkeypox is not primarily transmitted by monkeys; rather, until the current outbreak, the virus was most commonly found in and spread by rodents.

Harris explained that monkeypox got its name because the virus was first identified in a group of monkeys in a lab in Denmark in 1958.

""That’s the only reason it has had that name,"" she said.

The WHO has in fact been working with experts and partners to change the name of monkeypox, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in June. That announcement came after an international group of scientists called for the virus to be renamed to avoid discriminatory associations.

In the current outbreak, cases of monkeypox outside the 11 African countries where the disease is endemic began to be reported in early May.

The virus appears to be spreading primarily through sexual activity among men who have sex with men.

Infections have emerged in 82 countries, including Brazil, that have not historically reported monkeypox and in seven that have, CDC data shows. This year, the CDC says it has recorded over 2,300 cases.

In the U.S., monkeypox was declared a public health emergency last week. Nearly 9,500 cases have been confirmed."
A wind energy company has pleaded guilty after killing at least 150 eagles,https://www.npr.org/2022/04/06/1091250692/esi-energy-bald-eagles,nottheonion,"A wind energy company has pleaded guilty after killing at least 150 eagles

BILLINGS, Mont. — A wind energy company was sentenced to probation and ordered to pay more than $8 million in fines and restitution after at least 150 eagles were killed over the past decade at its wind farms in eight states, federal prosecutors said Wednesday.

NextEra Energy subsidiary ESI Energy pleaded guilty to three counts of violating the Migratory Bird Treaty Act during a Tuesday court appearance in Cheyenne, Wyoming. It was charged in the deaths of eagles at three of its wind farms in Wyoming and New Mexico.

In addition to those deaths, golden and bald eagles were killed at wind farms affiliated with ESI and NextEra since 2012 in eight states, prosecutors said: Wyoming, California, New Mexico, North Dakota, Colorado, Michigan, Arizona and Illinois. The birds are killed when they fly into the blades of wind turbines. Some ESI turbines killed multiple eagles, prosecutors said.

It's illegal to kill or harm eagles under federal law.

The bald eagle — the U.S. national symbol — was removed from protection under the Endangered Species Act in 2007, following a dramatic recovery from its widespread decimation due to harmful pesticides and other problems. Golden eagles have not fared as well, with populations considered stable but under pressure including from wind farms, collisions with vehicles, illegal shootings and poisoning from lead ammunition.

The case comes amid a push by President Joe Biden for more renewable energy from wind, solar and other sources to help reduce climate changing emissions. It also follows a renewed commitment by federal wildlife officials under Biden to enforce protections for eagles and other birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, after criminal prosecutions were halted under former President Donald Trump.

Companies historically have been able to avoid prosecution if they take steps to avoid bird deaths and seek permits for those that occur. ESI did not seek such a permit, authorities said.

The company was warned prior to building the wind farms in New Mexico and Wyoming that they would kill birds, but it proceeded anyway and at times ignored advice from federal wildlife officials about how to minimize the deaths, according to court documents.

""For more than a decade, ESI has violated (wildlife) laws, taking eagles without obtaining or even seeking the necessary permit,"" said Assistant Attorney General Todd Kim of the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division in a statement.

ESI agreed under a plea agreement to spend up to $27 million during its five-year probationary period on measures to prevent future eagle deaths. That includes shutting down turbines at times when eagles are more likely to be present.

Despite those measures, wildlife officials anticipate that some eagles still could die. When that happens, the company will pay $29,623 per dead eagle, under the agreement.

NextEra President Rebecca Kujawa said collisions of birds with wind turbines are unavoidable accidents that should not be criminalized. She said the company is committed to reducing damage to wildlife from its projects.

""We disagree with the government's underlying enforcement activity,"" Kujawa said in a statement. ""Building any structure, driving any vehicle, or flying any airplane carries with it a possibility that accidental eagle and other bird collisions may occur."""

Early Thursday evening, U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene shared a video on Twitter of her in a heated exchanged about gun control with three young activists outside the Capitol earlier that day.

In the tweet, Greene, a Georgia Republican, also wrote, ""These foolish cowards want the government to take away guns & the rights of parents to defend their children in schools.""

Roughly 25 minutes later, Marianna Pecora, who was one of the people arguing with Greene in the video, replied: ""Did she literally just tweet out the video of her kicking me?""

Video shows a heated conversation on gun control

Pecora, 18, is the deputy communications director for Voters of Tomorrow, a group focused on youth voter turnout. She and others from her group were in Washington, D.C., this week to lobby for youth rights.

In the 2:54 minute clip, Pecora appears to have walked in front of Greene to ask, ""How does the second amendment prevent gun violence?"" while filming the congresswoman's reaction.

Greene responded, ""Excuse me, out of the way, excuse me,"" to which Pecora begins to stumble and said, ""Oh my God."" Later, Pecora moves out of the way and accuses the congresswoman of kicking her.

The video does not directly show physical contact between Pecora and Greene.

The sides don't agree on what happened

Nick Dyer, Greene's communications director, told NPR that the allegation that Greene kicked Pecora was ""absolutely ridiculous"" and called it a ""lie.""

Pecora told NPR she is physically fine, but ""a little shaken"" emotionally.

""It's incredibly disheartening to me that a member of Congress has so little respect for the people of our country that she finds it acceptable to turn to trying to hurt them,"" she wrote in an email.

On Thursday evening, Santiago Mayer, the executive director of Voters of Tomorrow who was also involved in the verbal altercation, said, ""To answer the most prevalent question about pressing charges: we're talking to our legal team and keeping our options open."""

Prosecutors want parents of accused Michigan school shooter to halt romantic gestures in court,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/prosecutors-want-parents-accused-michigan-school-shooter-halt-romantic-rcna14677,nottheonion,"Prosecutors asked a judge to bar the parents of the accused Michigan school shooter from making romantic gestures toward each other in court, saying they're making a ""mockery of the crimes they're accused of committing.""

Jennifer and James Crumbley, who were each charged with four counts of involuntary manslaughter in the Nov. 30 shooting at Oxford High School, were said to have mouthed the words ""I love you"" during in-person and virtual court hearings on Dec. 14 and Jan. 7, according to a motion filed Tuesday in Oakland County District Court.

The couple also waved at each other and made other non-verbal signals, prosecutors said.

""The courtroom is not a place for blowing kisses and sending secret signals,"" Oakland County Chief Assistant Prosecutor David Williams said in a statement. ""This is a time for families to pursue justice.”

The motion added that the communications ""disparage the integrity of the judicial proceedings as a serious distraction"" and are ""traumatic for the family members of the deceased victims who are no longer able to express their love to the victims.""

Relatives have asked why the Crumbleys are allowed to make the gestures during court proceedings, the motion says.

Lawyers for the couple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The motion says they have ""indicated a willingness"" to tell the Crumbleys to halt the gestures.

The couple is accused of making a gun accessible to their teenage son who allegedly used it to open fire at the high school where he was a sophomore. Four students died and seven others, including a teacher, were injured.

The Crumbleys are also accused of ignoring their son's troubling behavior, including refusing to remove him from school the day of the shooting, when school counselors showed them his drawings depicting violence.

The couple pleaded not guilty to the charges. Their lawyers have previously said the Crumbleys never expected ""that a school shooting would take place, or that their son would be responsible.""

According to court documents filed last month, their son, Ethan Crumbley, plans to plead insanity to charges of murder and other crimes."

Eating Too Much Protein Makes Pee a Problem Pollutant in the U.S.,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/eating-too-much-protein-makes-pee-a-problem-pollutant-in-the-u-s/,nottheonion,"In the U.S., people eat more protein than they need to. And though it might not be bad for human health, this excess does pose a problem for the country’s waterways. The nation’s wastewater is laden with the leftovers from protein digestion: nitrogen compounds that can feed toxic algal blooms and pollute the air and drinking water. This source of nitrogen pollution even rivals that from fertilizers washed off of fields growing food crops, new research suggests.

When we overconsume protein—whether it comes from lentils, supplements or steak—our body breaks the excess down into urea, a nitrogen-containing compound that exits the body via urine and ultimately ends up in sewage. Maya Almaraz, a biogeochemist at the University of California, Davis, and her colleagues wanted to see how much of this nitrogen is being flushed into the U.S. sewage system because of a protein-heavy diet. The researchers combined population data and previous work on how much excess protein the average American eats and found that the majority of nitrogen pollution present in wastewater—some 67 to 100 percent—is a by-product of what people consume. “We think a lot about sewage nitrogen. We know that’s an issue,” Almaraz says. “But I didn’t know how much of that is actually affected by the choices we’re making way upstream—when we go the grocery store, when we cook a meal and what we end up putting in our bodies.”

Once it enters the environment, the nitrogen in urea can trigger a spectrum of ecological impacts known as the “nitrogen cascade.” Under certain chemical conditions, and in the presence of particular microbes, urea can break down to form gases of oxidized nitrogen. These gases reach the atmosphere, where nitrous oxide (N2O) can contribute to warming via the greenhouse effect and nitrogen oxides (NOx) can cause acid rain. Other times, algae and cyanobacteria, photosynthetic bacteria also called blue-green algae, feed on urea directly. The nitrogen helps them grow much faster than they would normally, clogging vital water supplies with blooms that can produce toxins that are harmful to humans, other animals and plants. And when the algae eventually die, the problem is not over. Microorganisms that feast on dead algae use up oxygen in the water, leading to “dead zones,” where many aquatic species simply cannot survive, in rivers, lakes and oceans. Blooms from Puget Sound to Tampa, Fla., have caused large fish die-offs.

Although it is possible to treat algal blooms, many of the current methods—such as spraying clay particles or chemicals over the surface of a bloom to kill and sink the algae—are not always effective at eliminating all of the harmful growth. Some of these methods can even lead to additional pollution. So the best strategy for dealing with the effects of nitrogen pollution is prevention, says Patricia Glibert, an oceanographer at the University of Maryland, who was not involved with the new study.

One option for preventing nitrogen from getting into the environment is improving wastewater treatment plants. The technology exists to remove 90 percent of nitrogen from wastewater, but only 1 percent of all U.S. sewage is currently treated this way, partly because the technology is so expensive. Equipping plants in China to remove nitrogen from three quarters of the country’s urban sewage cost more than $20 billion. Almaraz and her team suggest, however, that curbing nitrogen pollution could be approached more quickly with a change in eating habits that could save billions of dollars in the long term.

Their new study, published in Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, broke down protein requirements by age (adults 50 to 70 years old need the most) for the current U.S. population and projected future populations out to 2055. By midcentury, the country’s population is expected to be larger overall and to have a greater percentage of older people. The researchers calculated the amount of nitrogen that would enter the environment if people ate today’s average American diet and if they instead reduced their protein intake to only what is nutritionally needed. This shift in diet alone could reduce the amount of nitrogen reaching aquatic ecosystems by 12 percent today and by nearly 30 percent in the future, according to the study’s results. Such a change could also help reduce damaging nitrogen pollution while wastewater infrastructure catches up.

“Many people think that we need to all switch to becoming vegetarians. Obviously, that’s not practical. That’s not something that is really ever going to happen,” Glibert says. Rather than cutting out any foods entirely, she suggests consumers could switch to a “demitarian” diet—an approach that focuses on reducing the consumption of meat and dairy, which currently make up about two thirds of the protein eaten in the U.S. “Enjoy your steak, enjoy your burger but go modest on your meat consumption in your following meal,” she says.

“One cool area that opens up here is how human behavior can influence our environment,” Almaraz says. “I think it can be really empowering to people to understand that, ‘hey, my choices—once those add up with other people making similar choices—can actually have a positive impact.’”"
Another Stellenbosch University student suspended for urinating on roommate's chair,https://www.citizen.co.za/news/south-africa/another-stellenbosch-university-student-suspended-for-urinating-on-roommates-chair/,nottheonion,"By Kgomotso Phooko

Stellenbosch University (SU) has suspended a student who urinated on his roommate’s chair at the Helshoogte men’s residence.

This is the second urination scandal to hit the university this year.

Professor Deresh Ramjugernath, the university’s deputy vice-chancellor of learning and teaching, confirmed the incident and the suspension of the student pending investigations on Friday.

The student is believed to be a white student and the victim a coloured student.

He was also believed to have been drunk at the time of the incident.

The Helshoogte residence management was notified on the incident on Thursday. They then reported it to the relevant university structures for investigations.

“The incident involved an intoxicated student urinating on the chair of his roommate. The implicated student as suspended from the residence pending outcome of investigation on 22 September 2022,” said Ramjugernath.

Stellenbosch University’s office of student discipline will probe the case in accordance to the new student disciplinary code. Rector and vice-chancellor, Prof Wim de Villiers will decide on further action afterwards.

“The university considers details surrounding the investigation to be confidential but must emphasise its deep concern regarding irresponsible use of alcohol on and around its campus, notwithstanding its extensive interventions and latest revised residence rules that regulate alcohol use in residences,” said De Villiers.

Theuns du Toit

In May, the university made headlines when Theuns du Toit was filmed after he broke into fellow student Babalo Ndwayana’s room and urinated on his books and laptop.

This incident sparked public outcry and protests by black students who accused the management of racism.

Du Toit was suspended and later expelled in July after he was found guilty of contravening clauses of the disciplinary code for students.

ANC said more needs to be done at the university

Cameron Dugmore, the African National Congress (ANC) leader of the opposition in Western Cape, said more has to be done about the racist and sexist culture at the university.

“As we celebrate Heritage Day today, it is painful to see such practices are still part of the toxic culture at the university,” said Dugmore.

He said the ANC is trying to get in touch with the victim to offer him and his family support.

“We will also support all those progressive forces at Stellenbosch, on and off campus, who are in support of transforming the racist and institutional culture which lives on there in certain quarters,” added Dugmore.

"Many Republicans think the NFL does too much for Black players and are losing interest in the league, poll shows",https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-02-09/culture-wars-take-toll-on-the-nfl-as-republicans-sour-on-league-new-poll-finds,nottheonion,"The nation’s relentless culture wars appear to have taken a toll even on the NFL, with a large number of Republicans saying they have soured on the league and expressing disapproval of its efforts to improve the treatment of Black players, a new Los Angeles Times/SurveyMonkey poll shows.

Professional football remains extremely popular. The poll found just more than half of American adults say they regard themselves as fans and an additional 15% say they’re not fans but plan to watch the Super Bowl, which will be played Sunday at Inglewood’s SoFi Stadium between the Rams and the Cincinnati Bengals.

But the league’s popularity has eroded somewhat in recent years, the poll found.

Advertisement

About one-third of those surveyed nationwide said they are less of a fan now than they were five years ago, compared with about 1 in 8 who said they are bigger fans now.

The poll can’t conclusively say why that decline has occurred, but two questions about the NFL’s handling of issues involving race provide some strong hints:

People who say they are less of a fan now than they were five years ago are more than twice as likely as everyone else to say the NFL is doing “too much to show respect for its Black players.”

They’re also significantly less likely to approve of the league’s Rooney rule, which for the last two decades has required NFL teams to interview minority candidates for head coaching positions and certain other high-level jobs.

By contrast, another controversy involving the NFL — its response to the risk of long-term brain injuries among players — shows no such pattern. Overall, 62% of Americans say the league has not done enough to respond to that risk, compared with 27% who say it has done enough and 5% who say it has done too much. Those numbers don’t vary significantly between those who say they are lesser fans now and those who do not.

The group who say they are now lesser fans is disproportionately Republican, the poll found. Nearly half of those who identified themselves as Republicans or independents who lean to the GOP said their interest as fans had declined over the last five years. By comparison, only one-quarter of Democrats and independents who lean Democratic said that.

Republicans were also significantly more likely to express disapproval of the league’s efforts to show respect to Black players and to promote Black and other minority candidates for coaching jobs.

Among adults nationwide, 22% said they thought the NFL was doing “too much” to show respect for Black players. Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, that number shot up to 45%. Only 5% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents took that view.

Among the Democrats, 57% said the league was still not doing enough to show respect for Black players, a view expressed by just 9% of Republicans.

The partisan divide was far larger than the racial gap on that question. Among white adults, 26% said the NFL was doing too much, compared with 7% among Black adults, 19% among Latinos and 11% among Asian Americans.

A similarly large racial gap showed up when the poll asked people about the league’s Rooney rule, named after former Pittsburgh Steelers owner Dan Rooney.

The rule does not appear to have achieved its goal. The NFL currently has one Black head coach, Mike Tomlin in Pittsburgh, which is two fewer than in 2003, when the rule took effect. The Houston Texans fired David Culley, who is Black, as their head coach at the end of the regular season.

Representatives of civil rights groups met Monday with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to discuss the league’s failure to make progress on diversifying its top ranks. The meeting came after Brian Flores, the former head coach of the Miami Dolphins, filed suit against the league and three teams, accusing them of racial discrimination. The poll surveyed people during the week after Flores filed his suit.

Despite the doubts about the rule’s effectiveness, the poll found that Americans approve of it by about 2 to 1, with Black Americans favoring it by 80%.

Republicans, however, split over the rule, with 42% saying they approve of it compared with 52% who disapprove.

The large number of Republicans who oppose the Rooney rule and disapprove of the NFL’s overall approach to its Black players follows a growing trend within the party. Republicans, especially those who identify themselves as conservatives, are increasingly likely to say in polls — and in political debates — that discrimination against Black Americans and other people of color is a thing of the past and that white Americans are now being discriminated against.

Republican disapproval of the NFL may also stem in part from former President Trump’s criticism of the league over the way it has handled protests by players. In 2017 and 2018, Trump attacked the league, and Goodell in particular, for not disciplining players, most of them Black athletes, who took a knee during the playing of the national anthem before games to protest racial injustice."

The Thai government will hand out one million cannabis plants to households across the country, marking the landmark new legislation that will allow people to grow the plant in their homes for medicinal purposes, Thailand’s health minister has said.

In a nutshell

Announcing the plan in a Facebook post on 8 May, Health Minister Anutin Charnviraku said he wished for cannabis plants to be grown like ""household crops” with the new rule.

The legislation, which comes into force on 9 June, will give people the right to grow “as many cannabis plants” as needed in their own homes once they have notified their local government. The plants must be of medical grade as well as only being used for medicinal purposes only.

However, cannabis cannot be used commercially without a further licence. These announcements are all part of Thailand's intention to capitalise on cannabis as a cash crop, as over one-third of the country's force is engaged in agriculture.

Thailand made history as the first south-east Asian country to legalise cannabis for medical use in 2018.

Cannabis-related businesses

As well as revealing the nationwide one million plant giveaway, Anutin explained in the Facebook post that Thai companies that have been registered will be legally allowed sell cannabis products containing less than 0.2 per cent tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the part of the plant responsible for getting people high.

“This will enable people and the government to generate more than 10 billion baht per year in revenue from marijuana and hemp,” the health minister said in the post.

“Meanwhile, people can showcase their cannabis and hemp-related products and wisdom and sell their products nationwide,” he added.

What has been said?

“It will still be considered criminal if you don’t have a legal prescription and you have to be a patient of some form of ailment for this to work. Only then will you be able to grow cannabis at home and use it however you like,” Kitty Chopaka, a Bangkok-based cannabis entrepreneur told CNN.

She added that despite recreational smoking still remaining illegal, “smoking weed will happen, and there’s no way the government can stop that.”"
"Bangladeshi Police pull up social media star for being 'too ugly to sing', make him apologise for destroying classics.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/music/bangladeshi-police-pull-up-social-media-star-for-being-too-ugly-to-sing-101659872057038.html,nottheonion,"An out-of-tune Bangladeshi singer with a huge internet following was hauled in by police at dawn and told to cease his painful renditions of classical songs, sparking a furore on social media. Hero Alom in one of his videos.

""Hero"" Alom, as he styles himself, has amassed nearly two million Facebook followers and almost 1.5 million on YouTube with his unique crooning style and arresting, raunchy videos.

One of his numbers, Arabian Song, in which he appears in traditional Arab clothing on a sand dune with camels superimposed in the background, has garnered 17 million views.

But he has also drawn critics' scorn, particularly for versions of classic songs of two beloved national treasures -- Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore and Bangladesh's national poet Kazi Nazrul Islam.

On Wednesday Alom told AFP that he was ""mentally tortured"" last week by police who told him to stop performing classical songs, that he was too ugly to be a singer, and to sign an ""apology"" bond.

""The police picked me up at 6 am and kept me there for eight hours. They asked me why I sing Rabindra and Nazrul songs,"" he said.

Dhaka's chief detective Harun ur Rashid told reporters that Alom had apologised for singing the cherished songs and for wearing police uniforms without permission in his videos.

""We received many complaints against him,"" Harun said. ""(He) totally changed the (traditional) style (of singing)... He assured us that he won't repeat this,"" Harun added.

Farook Hossain, deputy police commissioner of Dhaka, rejected claims by Alom, 37, that he had also been pressed to change his name.

""He is making these comments just to go viral in social media,"" he told AFP.

Following his ordeal, Alam released a new video depicting himself behind bars in a prison outfit, warbling mournfully that he is about to be hanged.

Alom's treatment triggered outrage on social media, with commentators and activists calling it an attack on individual rights -- even if his singing grates.

""I am not a fan of your songs or your acting. But if there is an attempt to muzzle your voice, I stand up against it,"" journalist Aditya Arafat posted.

""Don't be broken. You are a hero. No matter what others say, you are a real hero,"" Sanjida Khatun Rakhi wrote on Alom's Facebook page.

Alom says he has acted in several films and also participated in Bangladesh's parliamentary election in 2018 as an independent candidate -- garnering 638 votes.

He told AFP at his Dhaka studio that he started using the moniker ""Hero"" after becoming popular in his home district of Bogra, 150 kilometres (95 miles) north of Dhaka.

""I felt like I am a hero. So I took the name Hero Alom. I won't drop this name no matter what,"" he said. ""At present, it seems you can't even sing with freedom in Bangladesh."""
"Two Pottstown churches cited for violating the zoning code’s definition of ‘church,’ by offering free meals and other services",https://whyy.org/articles/two-pottstown-churches-zoning-violation-notices-definition-church/,nottheonion,"This isn’t the first time in recent history that services for unhoused people have struggled to stay afoot in Pottstown.

In the fall of 2021, Al’s Heartwarming Center, the only shelter in the Pottstown area for single adults, was denied a yearlong extension of Pottstown Borough Council approval to operate. The shelter was forced to close its doors on May 1.

And in Norristown, the Coordinated Homeless Outreach Center, CHOC, Montgomery County’s only 24/7 emergency housing service for single adults, closed on June 30. The organization tried to have their lease extended to bid for more time to find a new home, but were rejected. The land is set to be conveyed to the municipality of Norristown.

Meanwhile, the affordable housing crisis continues in the Philadelphia suburbs. The number of unhoused people across Montgomery County has risen by at least 118% from 2021 to 2022, according to the county’s 2022 Point-in-Time count. The PIC identified 568 individuals sleeping in one of the county’s emergency shelters (including hotel rooms paid for with public funding), transitional housing projects, or outdoors.

According to Schilling, it’s not just unhoused people who benefit from their services at Mission First.

“It’s the people that live in the high rise apartments [near Mission First], the older people, they come up there every day for some food,” said Schilling.

Older adults in the suburbs are facing unique obstacles in finding and staying in affordable housing.

“There may be, at our meal on Wednesday evenings, three or four homeless people and the rest are just people that are working, that are struggling.”

The citation says that if the churches wish to continue their services, they must submit an application for a zoning variance, to be approved or denied by the Pottstown Borough Zoning Hearing Board.

But Schilling said they have no plans to submit an application, are poised to appeal the violation, and take the borough to district court if necessary.

“We’re not going to back down. We’re not going to stop doing what we do because that’s just what the church does. That’s what we do. We help people,” said Schilling.

She said she wasn’t optimistic the borough would approve their zoning appeal, but either way, filing for approval to conduct these services would set a chilling precedent.

“If we do it for this, then we would have to do it for every other little ministry.,… You shouldn’t have to do that,” said Schilling.

She said offering free food and essentials is part of their ministry, and the borough doesn’t have the right to define what a church is or does.

Millionaire burns a $10M Frida Kahlo artwork to sell as NFT,https://culturacolectiva.com/art/frida-kahlo-artwork-burned-nft/,nottheonion,"The world of NFTS is becoming more and more relevant among people who love technology. However, some are taking it to very extreme levels. That is the case of Martin Mobarak, a millionaire resident of Miami, who burned an illustration by Frida Kahlo valued at $10M to make a nonfungible token (NFT) with it.

The millionaire organized an event for the burning of the work known as Fantasmones Siniestros and although he assured that the proceeds from its sale will go to help children, his action is generating much controversy, as the historical piece was a drawing from the artist’s diary.

The 57-year-old Mobarak’s justification is that supposedly Frida Kahlo would have liked to destroy her works for the benefit of others. The man is the CEO of Frida.NFT, is an organization dedicated to blockchain technology dedicated to bringing together collectors, creators, and art lovers to ‘immortalize’ works and sell them for altruistic purposes. “I hope those who are here can understand, it’s to help sick children and victims of domestic abuse,” the entrepreneur assured.

Before the act, ‘Arte Capital’ and some of Diego Rivera’s relatives declared that Frida Kahlo’s work was not well protected in Mexico, and that’s why it ended up destroyed. “It seems to me a medieval act, an atrocious act, it is not necessary to burn something in the physical universe to put it into the metaverse,” said Diego Maria Alvarado Rivera, great-grandson of the painter.

And with all the controversy since July 30, a cryptocurrency portal claimed that Fantasmones Siniestros was “an ultra-high definition digital copy” created supposedly intending to copy the original work; however, it is still unknown whether this is true or not.

Tennessee state senator offers Hitler as inspiration to homeless,https://thehill.com/news/state-watch/3267283-tennessee-state-senator-offers-hitler-as-inspiration-to-homeless/,nottheonion,"A Tennessee state senator on Wednesday used Adolf Hitler as an example of inspiration and hope for the homeless during a speech on the floor of the state’s upper chamber.

Tennessee state Sen. Frank Niceley (R) made his remarks on the Senate floor during a debate on a bill to make camping or soliciting along state highways or exit ramps a misdemeanor.

Niceley said that he was going to give his fellow lawmakers a “history lesson,” adding that in 1910, Hitler took to the streets and practiced his oratory and his people skills.

“Hitler decided to live on the streets for a while. So for two years, Hitler lived on the streets and practiced oratory and his body language and how to connect with the masses, and then went on to lead a life that got him into history books,” he said.

“So a lot of these people, it’s not a dead end. They can come out of this, these homeless camps and have a productive life, or in Hitler’s case, a very unproductive life,” he continued. “I support this bill.”

The Hill has reached out to Niceley’s office for additional comment on his speech. The Hill also reached out to state Sen. Ferrell Haile (R), the Speaker pro tempore of the state Senate.

Following Niceley’s remarks, some state lawmakers took to social media to condemn his comments.

“TN Senator says Hitler made something of himself after being homeless & you can too. I’m going to have to apologize to the universe for this guy,” tweeted state Rep. Gloria Johnson (D), along with the video of Niceley’s speech.

“Hey @MeidasTouch not a single day passes without TN GOP embarrassing the hell out of our state.”

The bill is aimed at cutting down homeless camps, according to Fox 17. The legislation was passed on Wednesday and is now headed to Gov. Bill Lee’s (R) desk for his signature.

Opponents of the bill say it is unfair and argue that the way to combat homelessness is with more housing.

“The answer to homelessness and we’ve said it over and over is more housing. We need to put the resources that we are spending making more laws that are clearly inhumane into the resources we need to build more housing units,” said Paula Foster, a nonprofit homelessness advocate, according to the outlet."
Thailand may cancel $400 million deal to buy Chinese submarines because they have no engines.,https://thediplomat.com/2022/04/thai-chinese-submarine-deal-faces-axe-pm-prayut/,nottheonion,"Advertisement

Thailand’s procurement of a submarine from China could be canceled after a German company said it was unable to supply the needed propulsion system, the country’s Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said earlier this week.

In 2017, Thailand agreed to the purchase of the S26T submarine for 13.5 billion baht ($402.9 million), with payments to be made in installments over a seven-year period, with delivery expected next year.

But that deadline is unlikely to be met following the recent news that Germany’s Motor and Turbine Union company has refused to supply cutting-edge MTU396 diesel engines to the Chinese firm building the S26T Yuan-class submarine for the Royal Thai Navy (RTN). The German company is reportedly barred from making the sale due to a European Union government embargo on the sale of military items to China, imposed in the aftermath of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacres.

“What do we do with a submarine with no engines? Why should we purchase it?” Prayut told reporters on Monday, according to the Bangkok Post. “If the agreement can’t be fulfilled, we have to figure out what to do. Isn’t that how we solve a problem?”

According to Thai PBS World, the two governments will hold talks later this month in a bid to settle the submarine engine issue, with Adm. Somprasong Nilsamai, the chief of the RTN, insisting that China Shipbuilding & Offshore International Co (CSOC) has to comply with the contract, which specifically makes mention of the German propulsion system.

CSOC has offered the RTN two alternatives: to use Chinese-made engines that it deems equivalent to the German ones, or to transfer two of China’s decommissioned submarines to Thailand. Thailand has refused both offers.

When asked if the Thai government has the ability to terminate the contract, Prayut said the matter will be considered by authorities concerned. But he insisted that any cancellation would not affect relations between Bangkok and Beijing, which have warmed since Prayut’s seizure of power in a coup in 2014.

The most pressing question raised by the German engine affair is why neither side anticipated it, given the fact that the EU embargo has been in place for more than three decades. In any event, the engine troubles add a new twist to what has been since its inception a controversial procurement. Observers have long questioned the wisdom or necessity of Thailand acquiring submarines, a goal of the RTN since the 1960s, and the specific Chinese deal has been criticized as a costly extravagance amid the economic devastation of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Indeed, in September 2020, amid the economically ruinous lockdowns and facing a rising tide of public opposition, the Thai government officially postponed the purchase of two additional submarines from China, which were set to cost Bangkok 22.5 billion baht ($671 million). Last year, Prayut again ordered the RTN to delay the purchase of the two boats, which has been put on hold for four years. Given the current troubles, however, it seems like Thailand will be lucky if it ends up with one of its planned fleet of submarines."
More School Students Killed In Shootings Than Police So Far In 2022,https://ourgeneration.news/news/more-school-students-killed-in-shootings-than-police-so-far-in-2022,nottheonion,"Within 24 hours the tweet amassed over 185,000 likes. Cohen continued by claiming that at least 33 children have been killed in school shootings in 2022 compared to 20 police officers. The Officer Down Memorial Page memorializes police officers lost in the line of duty, remembering their names and the cause of death. Under “Gunfire” there are twenty deaths recorded by shooting. Cohen cites an EducationWeek article that notes that 24 “[s]tudents or other children” and 3 school employees have been killed in school shootings so far in 2022 (as opposed to the 33 claimed by Cohen). The article also notes that there have so far been 27 school shootings with injuries or deaths and along with the slain there have been 56 people injured. Other sources have confirmed that more children have been killed in school shootings than police officers who were fatally shot in the line of duty.

The startling and grotesque fact that more school children are murdered with guns in school shootings than police officers in the line of duty captures the sheer scale of the crisis of school shootings in the country. America is barely halfway through 2022 and has already witnessed 27 school shootings since January 1st. With 52 weeks in a year that means there has been roughly one school shooting for every week of 2022. The Gun Violence Archive has already recorded 214 mass shootings that have occurred so far in 2022, more than once a day. The archive noted 692 mass shootings last year alone.

In response to the massacre and Washington’s consistent failure to reform gun laws, students have organized protests. Students Demand Action, a non-profit subsidiary of Everytown for Gun Safety, has organized at least 80 events on May 26th alone to protest gun violence with more planned in the following days and weeks. Students Demand Action has more than 400 groups across the country and active volunteers in every state and D.C. per its website. “We won’t accept a country where gunfire can ring out at any moment, whether it’s while grocery shopping at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, a party in San Bernardino, or graduations across the country,” vowed organizers with the group. “We deserve more.”"
A Black man jailed instead of a white male felon with a similar name is suing police,https://www.npr.org/2022/01/25/1075552126/black-man-jailed-white-male-felon-similar-name-suing-shane-brown,nottheonion,"A Black man jailed instead of a white male felon with a similar name is suing police

Enlarge this image toggle caption AP AP

Shane Lee Brown is suing the police departments in Las Vegas and Henderson, Nev., and several officers after they jailed him for six days, instead of a white man with a similar name who is taller, nearly twice as old and a convicted felon.

The lawsuit alleges that Shane Lee Brown, a Black man who was 23 years old at the time, was driving home on Jan. 8, 2020, when he was pulled over by Henderson police officers. He did not have his license but provided his name, Social Security number and Social Security card.

The lawsuit says that during the records check, the Henderson Police Department officers ""confused"" Shane Lee Brown with Shane Neal Brown, a 49-year-old man who is 4 inches taller than Shane Lee Brown, has a beard, and is white.

Shane Neal Brown was first convicted of a felony in 1994, and a warrant was out for his arrest in 2019 for possession of a firearm.

Shane Lee Brown remained in custody for six days, despite repeatedly telling officials he was not the Shane Brown they were looking for. He was released on Jan. 14, 2020.

""Had any of the LVMPD or any corrections officers performed any due diligence ... they would have easily determined that Shane Lee Brown has been misidentified as the subject of the warrant,"" the lawsuit says.

Shane Lee Brown is suing for negligence, emotional distress, false imprisonment and violation of civil rights and is asking for $500,000 in damages.

In response to the lawsuit, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said it does not provide comment on pending litigation.

New York City man rescued twice in 2 days on Arizona hikes,https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-new-york-arizona-hiking-flagstaff-2d109af5c0467cf8396223c02a879ade,nottheonion,"FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) — A New York City man who needed to be rescued twice on consecutive days while hiking in a northern Arizona mountain range is urging others to pay more attention to winter weather than he did.

“Warning: Unless you are an experienced alpine mountaineer, DO NOT attempt Humphreys Peak in the winter. There is so much snow that it’s difficult to follow the trail and very easy to fall off of it. Moreover, the wind is absolutely brutal,” Phillip Vasto said in an online post.

The 28-year-old Brooklyn man first called 911 last Wednesday at about 7 p.m. to say he got lost while hiking on Humphreys Trail in the San Francisco Peaks overlooking Flagstaff, the Coconino County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement.

The statement didn’t identify Vasto by name but he spoke to the Arizona Daily Sun , telling the newspaper in a story published Tuesday that he was an experienced hiker but had underestimated the difficult conditions.

“I was thinking if I start early in the morning, I’ll have all the time in the world to reach the summit,” Vasto said of his second attempt.

The trail runs through some 5.5 miles (8.9 kilometers) of steep, rocky terrain between the Arizona Snowbowl ski resort and Humphreys Peak, the state’s highest point with an elevation of 12,633 feet (3,851 meters).

During the first rescue, tracked vehicles from the ski resort that travel on snow drove Vasto off the mountain and he declined medical attention.

But at 5 p.m. the next day, Vasto called 911 to say he needed help after injuring himself in a fall near a ridge on the Humphreys Trail.

An Arizona Department of Public Safety rescue helicopter was sent to pick up Vasto and another hiker who had stopped to help him.

Vasto was “provided with preventative search and rescue education about the conditions on the trail and the approaching winter storm and encouraged to not attempt the hike again,” the Sheriff’s Office statement said.

The other hiker who stopped to help Vasto, Phillip Wyatt, said it was “very apparent that he wasn’t prepared for the climate that he had gotten himself into.”

Wyatt decided to stay with Vasto and provided his number to the search and rescue team so that they could make contact in the likely scenario that Vasto’s phone ran out of battery life because he had been using it to check his route on a trail locater app.

“I really respect Phil’s perseverance,” Wyatt told the Daily Sun. “I hope that he’s able to make it to the top sometime.”"

UVALDE, Texas – Shocking testimony from the Texas DPS director on Tuesday has revealed even more insight into the “abject failure” of response to the Uvalde shooting that occurred on May 24.

Texas Department of Public Safety Director Col. Steven McCraw revealed that the husband of slain elementary teacher Eva Mireles tried to save her but was barred from doing so.

Ruben Ruiz is a police officer for the school district and was on the scene after the gunman entered the school and opened fire.

McCraw said Mireles called Ruiz and told him that “she had been shot and was dying.”

“And what happened to him, is he tried to move forward into the hallway,” McCraw said. “He was detained and they took his gun away from him and escorted him off the scene.”

McCraw didn’t say who specifically detained Ruiz.

Attorney who fought Florida helmet laws died in motorcycle crash while not wearing one,https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida/2022/10/25/attorney-who-fought-florida-helmet-laws-died-motorcycle-crash-while-not-wearing-one/,nottheonion,"In the late 1990s, when Florida bikers were still required to wear helmets, Pinellas lawyer Ron Smith was an aggressive advocate for overturning the law.

Smith was a member of ABATE — A Brotherhood Against Totalitarian Enactments and American Bikers Aimed Toward Education — which lobbied against the law for years. He represented clients who ran afoul of Florida’s motorcycle requirements in court cases that some say helped overturn Florida’s helmet law.

One of the cases went all the way to the 2nd District Court of Appeal, which ruled that Florida’s helmet law at the time was constitutional, but that the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles had failed to properly publish a list of protective equipment as required by law.

Smith didn’t like being told what to do and valued his independence, said Dave Newman, who met the attorney through an American Legion post in Old Town where they were both members.

“He thought everybody should have their own choice,” Newman said.

In 2000, Smith’s aspiration was realized when the Florida Legislature passed a law allowing motorcyclists over 21 to go without head protection as long as they had $10,000 in insurance coverage for motorcycle accident injuries.

In August, Smith and his girlfriend, Brenda Jeanan Volpe, were riding a motorcycle on U.S. 19 in Pinellas County. They were headed to a memorial service for another biker who had died of cancer.

Smith crashed the bike as he tried to slow for traffic ahead of him. Both he and Volpe were killed.

Neither was wearing a helmet.

The Crash

Smith and Volpe were on their first ride with the American Legion Post 173 in Holiday when they crashed.

Smith, 66, was an experienced rider. He had been a member of the American Legion rider’s group in Old Town for about two years, even serving as the rider director for a year. Volpe, 62, rode along as Smith’s passenger.

As they headed south on U.S. 19 on the morning of Aug. 20, Smith lost control of his bike as he tried to slow down for traffic near the intersection with Eagle Chase Boulevard. Smith’s motorcycle started spinning clockwise and the bike collided with a trailer attached to a pickup truck in another lane.

No one has been charged in the accident, said Florida Highway Patrol spokesperson Steve Gaskins.

It’s impossible to say whether a helmet would have prevented Smith’s and Volpe’s deaths, experts said. Smith’s autopsy report lists blunt head trauma as his cause of death and an initial report from the Hillsborough Medical Examiner’s Office also lists Volpe’s cause of death as head trauma.

“It’s entirely possible that if they were wearing a helmet they might have survived, but again, we can’t say for sure. It certainly would have improved their odds,” said Eric Teoh, who has researched motorcycle safety at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.

Helmets decrease the risk of death for motorcyclists by 37%, according to a study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. They are estimated to be about 41% effective for motorcycle passengers, meaning that for every 100 motorcyclist deaths, 41 could’ve been prevented if the riders were wearing helmets.

In states without helmet laws, 57% of motorcyclists who died in 2020 were not wearing a helmet compared to 11% of motorcyclists in states with helmet laws. Fifteen states and the District of Columbia have laws requiring helmets for all riders on all motorcycle-type vehicles.

Florida’s death rate increased by 25% after its helmet law was repealed, according to one study, and the number of motorcyclists admitted to hospitals with head injuries jumped 82% in the 30 months following the law change.

Nationwide, “things are moving in the wrong direction,” with preliminary reports showing a 9% increase in motorcyclist deaths from 2020 to 2021, Teoh said.

“Motorcyclists face greater risk on the road than occupants of enclosed vehicles,” Teoh said. “So it’s just really, really important to protect themselves.”

Legacies

Friends remembered Smith as a sharp lawyer who loved to argue, but who also had a dry sense of humor and a generous spirit.

In 1996, he represented a man who was ticketed for riding without a helmet in Madeira Beach, according to a Tampa Tribune article. That case got the Pinellas Sheriff’s Office to briefly stop enforcing the state’s helmet law after a county judge dismissed the citation. The judge relied on another court case that Smith had handled in which a different county judge ruled that Florida’s helmet law was unconstitutional.

Smith told the Tribune at the time that he went out “looking for a ticket” in Pinellas County by riding a motorcycle without a helmet for 90 miles.

“I passed at least a half-dozen cops,” he said in an interview. “And all I got was a sunburn.”

Smith spent six years as a prosecutor, Pinellas-Pasco State Attorney Bruce Bartlett said. Smith also worked in criminal defense and was a strong advocate for his clients, said fellow lawyer Joseph Hobson, who described Smith as “an outstanding attorney.”

Tampa defense attorney Bryant Camareno first met Smith about 30 years ago. Camareno was a young prosecutor at the time, while Smith had transitioned over to criminal defense. Smith was a somewhat unconventional attorney, Camareno said: He didn’t wear the double-breasted suits favored by many lawyers, but instead came to court with long hair, a mustache and a pair of boots.

“He looked like someone you would see in a biker bar,” Camareno said.

Gary Pruss, who met Smith through the American Legion post in Old Town, fondly recalled breakfasts with Smith, who loved everything on the menu from eggs to hash browns to grits.

“He was a guy that you went to for advice,” Pruss said.

Volpe was a social woman who loved her kids and was always eager to help out at American Legion functions, friends recalled.

Gary Pruss’ wife, Connie Pruss, said Volpe was full of “piss and vinegar” and fondly recalled a surprise party that Volpe planned for Smith.

“She was funny,” Connie Pruss said. “She had the biggest smile.”

Newman remembered Volpe as an outgoing, bubbly woman who was, in many ways, Smith’s opposite.

“The first time I met her, she acted like we’d known each other our entire lives,” Newman said.

Smith’s son declined an interview request and attempts to reach Volpe’s children at phone numbers listed under their names were unsuccessful.

After the crash, the American Legion Post in Holiday implemented a handful of new safety rules, according to its rider director, Eddie Rodriguez.

They will ask riders whether they have taken any motorcycle safety courses, and if not, connect them to a class. Riders will be asked about their experience level and medical histories. They’ll also be required to do a road test before going on rides with the group, and ride in the back of the formation on their first group ride.

The post isn’t requiring helmets, though they are highly encouraged, Rodriguez said. He said the group doesn’t want to alienate those who might not want to wear them.

Even so, that rule might not be needed at this point. Riders who had previously resisted helmets have started wearing them, Rodriguez said. And on his first ride after the deaths, Rodriguez made an observation while looking at all the riders in the group.

“Every single one had a helmet on,” he said."
Mental health nurse played 'chappy' on paranoid patient's door,https://news.stv.tv/east-central/mental-health-nurse-at-royal-edinburgh-hospital-played-chappy-on-paranoid-patients-door,nottheonion,"An Edinburgh mental health nurse has been given a caution order for playing ‘chappy’ on the door of a patient with paranoia.

Douglas Masson, a nurse at Royal Edinburgh Hospital, was accused of knocking on the door of the patient and then hiding in September 2019.

The service user, dubbed Patient A to protect their anonymity, suffered from various mental health conditions – including paranoia – and had been admitted to the hospital in November 2017.

The mental health nurse, who has practised for 30 years, was found to have put the patient at risk of “psychological and/or emotional harm” by doing so.

Mr Masson was also accused of telling the user “you won’t be getting out of here, you are delusional” ahead of their tribunal hearing on October 2, 2019.

However, this charge was never proven as the patient’s evidence was found to be “vague and inconsistent”.

The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) was told that Mr Masson recognised it was “not the best thing to do”, that it was out of character and a “matter of poor judgement”.

Mr Masson also apologised to Patient A and underwent training after the incident.

The NMC said: “The panel considered that you should have known that Patient A was vulnerable. You were an experienced mental health nurse and were familiar with Patient A and his particular care needs.

“The panel was of the view that, although a one-off, your actions were a serious misjudgement and fell well below the standard of clinical care that Patient A should have received, and therefore amounted to misconduct.

It continued: “Nurses occupy a position of privilege and trust in society and are expected at all times to be professional and to maintain professional boundaries.

“Patients and their families must be able to trust nurses with their lives and the lives of their loved ones.

“To justify that trust, nurses must make sure that their conduct at all times justifies both their patients’ and the public’s trust in the profession.

Since Mr Masson was found to have shown “genuine remorse” for his actions, which he could not explain, the panel gave him a two-year caution order.

Under this, any employer will be on notice that his fitness to practice was found impaired. The notice will be removed after the two-year period, but will remain on record with the NMC.

"Biden admin says 66 too old for commercial pilots, as president nears 80",https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/biden-admin-old-commercial-pilots-ages-president-80,nottheonion,"The Biden administration says that 66 years old is too old for commercial airline pilots as President Biden nears 80 years old.

Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg expressed his opposition to raising the airline pilot retirement age to 67, from 65, over the weekend on ""Fox News Sunday"" as his boss nears octogenarian status.

While speaking on ""Fox News Sunday,"" the transportation secretary said that the retirement ages were ""there for a reason"" and that he was ""not going to be on board with anything that compromises safety.""

BUTTIGIEG ANNOUNCES NEW INVESTIGATIONS OF AIRLINES AMID RISING PASSENGER DISSATISFACTION

""The answer is not to keep the baby boomer generation in the cockpit indefinitely,"" Buttigieg said.

""The answer is to make sure we have as many and as good pilots ready to take their place, to have a stronger pipeline,"" he continued. ""We’re backing that up with FAA programs that support high school and college curriculum to get into aviation, and of course ultimately it’ll be for the airlines and those employers to hire and retain excellent talent.""

FOX Business asked the White House and Department of Transportation why the administration believes 66 is too old to be a commercial pilot but 80 isn't too old to be president of the United States.

Neither answered FOX Business’ questions.

Buttigieg also said during the interview that his department is launching new investigations into airlines as flights are being canceled left and right.

""We have just concluded another 10 investigations on airlines on these issues and have launched another ten or so that we’re going to pursue to make sure that the consumers and passengers are protected,"" Buttigieg said.

Host Mike Emanuel noted that there is a shortage of pilots, and while current law requires U.S. commercial pilots to retire by age 65, lawmakers like Sen. Lindsey Graham are looking into raising this to 67. Buttigieg firmly opposed this.

Biden will turn 80 shortly after the midterm elections on Nov. 20."
Martin Shkreli claims porn virus cost him $450K in crypto. The file “BigTitsRoundAsses” triggered the transfer and caused a 95% collapse of his crypto project. Others suspect Shkreli was in on the pump and dump,https://www.inputmag.com/culture/martin-shkreli-porn-virus-crypto-tokens-web3-druglike,nottheonion,"Martin Shkreli, one of the most notorious grifters of the 2010s, has already destroyed whatever goodwill he was trying to secure through the creation of Druglike, a web3 platform for pharmaceutical modeling. Not even a month removed from the venture’s announcement, Shkreli has been tied to an early token dump for the cryptocurrency that was supposedly powering the project.

As reported by Web3isgoinggreat, $MSI’s (short for Martin Shkreli Inu, which is in fact a real token) valuation dropped by 90 percent after a crypto wallet connected to Shkreli dumped its holdings in exchange for 239 ETH, or a little over $450,000.

Last Friday, $MSI plummeted in value following the sell-off of a large volume of tokens that were traced back to Shkreli Coinmarketcap

While it isn’t surprising that the human pharma bro meme — who is actually banned from working in the pharmaceutical industry after imposing a price hike on the life-saving drug, Daraprim — could be tied to a potential token dump before the company’s launch, it’s also possible there’s more to the story.

BigTitsRoundAsses.exe — After YouTuber Muta Anas posted a video calling out Shkreli for being hacked, Shkreli himself reached out to Anas, the man behind a channel called SomeOrdinaryGamers, to offer an explanation for the dump. According to Shkreli, the suspicious token dump was the result of a hack stemming from malware inadvertently torrented while Shkreli tried to download some pornography.

The file in question, entitled “BigTitsRoundAsses,” was not in fact an .mp4, but a .zip file containing a 700MB screensaver. It was through this, Shkreli says, that the hacker group was able to use a remote trojan to gain access to his personal information, including the keys to his crypto wallet.

If Shkreli’s claims are true — and he provides Anas some evidence that they are — it would appear he apparently failed to examine the extension of the file he was downloading, which would have revealed a lack of any pornographic material. If that’s the case, ultimately a lack of due diligence may have cost the investors in his project hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Fool me twice — Shkreli is fresh out of a prison stint that was imposed for a series of financial crimes that were unrelated to his pharmaceutical price-gouging; he’s barely holding on, if at all, to any credibility. Given that, it would certainly be a choice to engage in traceable pump-and-dump crypto scheming this soon after re-entering society. Maybe he did get hacked after all? We can’t say for sure, but he’s provided at least some receipts owning to that fact.

Regardless of the exact reasoning for the sell-off, one thing is clear: Any venture headed by Shkreli, especially one that is pharmaceutical-adjacent, should probably be steered clear of."

Uvalde mayor accuses state of leaking records to make local police look bad,https://www.keranews.org/news/2022-06-22/uvalde-mayor-accuses-state-of-leaking-records-to-make-local-police-look-bad,nottheonion,"Uvalde Mayor Don McLaughlin on Tuesday accused state authorities of selectively releasing information about last month’s school shooting to scapegoat local law enforcement and intentionally leaving out details about the state’s response to the massacre.

New details emerged this week about the timeline of the shooting based on surveillance video from the school’s hallways and a transcript of officers’ body cameras. The records show that officers might not have attempted to open the doors of the classrooms where the gunman had holed up with victims. During a state Senate committee held earlier Tuesday, Texas Department of Public Safety Director Steve McCraw told lawmakers that law enforcement’s response to the Uvalde school shooting was an “abject failure.”

McLaughlin lambasted McCraw for what he described as a selective release of information about the investigation, focusing on blaming local law enforcement and leaving out the role of McCraw’s agency during the shooting.

“McCraw has continued to, whether you want to call it, lie, leak … mislead or misstate information in order to distance his own troopers and rangers from the response,” McLaughlin said Tuesday evening.

McLaughlin said none of the entities with information about the investigation into the May 24 shooting at Robb Elementary School — DPS, the Texas Legislature, the Uvalde County District Attorney’s office and the FBI — have briefed Uvalde city officials about their findings.

McLaughlin said he had been asked to refrain from sharing details about the investigation while it was ongoing but said Tuesday he would now start releasing that information as it became available to city officials.

“The gloves are off. If we know it, we will share it,” he said.

McLaughlin’s comments at a special City Council meeting seemed to contradict a press release issued just hours before, in which the mayor had said city officials would refrain from commenting on the investigation “or reacting to every story attributed to unnamed sources or sources close to the investigation.”

The special meeting was held in part to discuss whether to grant a leave of absence for Pete Arredondo, the newly elected City Council member who also serves as the chief of police of the city’s school district and has been criticized for his role in the law enforcement response to the shooting. Local leaders unanimously denied giving him the leave of absence from future council meetings.

Arredondo was not present during Tuesday’s special meeting. He testified in closed session to a state House committee on Tuesday in Austin, though it was not clear if Arredondo requested the leave of absence from City Council meetings.

If Arredondo fails to show up for three consecutive meetings without obtaining a leave of absence, he will forfeit his position as a council member for Uvalde’s District 3, per the city’s charter.

The council’s vote followed some of the community’s most forceful public calls for accountability and transparency about the details of the May 24 shooting that left 19 children and two teachers dead. Law enforcement officers who responded to the shooting — and in particular Arredondo, who has been labeled by state officials as the “incident commander” on the scene — have been under fire for taking over an hour to engage and take down the shooter.

Arredondo’s account of the events differs in some key aspects from the information gleaned from records and law enforcement statements. He told The Texas Tribune he attempted to open the classrooms’ doors but they were locked. He has also said he did not consider himself to be the incident commander at the scene.

Residents on Tuesday also expressed anger at city officials’ silence after the shooting and what seemed like their support of Arredondo. Some people in the crowd held signs that read, “Fire Pete” and “Hey, Pete. Get Out.” Uvalde resident Brett Cross called for Arredondo’s removal and demanded that the council respond to the community’s calls for accountability and transparency, saying, “If I failed my job I’d get fired, and that would apply for anyone here.”

Before the council’s vote, Berlinda Arreola, grandmother of 10-year-old Amerie Jo Garza, who was killed in last month’s shooting, said that the days since May 24 have been a rollercoaster of emotions. The hurt and anger she’s since felt get “worse and worse,” she said.

Arreola called for Arredondo’s removal from the council, saying, “Do what you have to do but get him out of our faces.”

Jesus Rizo, the uncle of another victim, 9-year-old Jackie Cazares, said, “At one point or another, ladies and gentlemen, we have to determine what’s right and what’s wrong.”

Rizo, who called himself Arredondo’s friend and McLaughlin’s neighbor, added that he wants the mayor to be as forceful holding people accountable as he was when he rebuked gubernatorial candidate Beto O’Rourke when he interrupted a press conference held by Gov. Greg Abbott about the shooting.

Rogelio Muñoz, a former Uvalde council member who previously represented Arredondo’s district, expressed concern over the city’s handling of public information.

“The community needs you to be advocates. These families need you to be advocates,” Muñoz said.

Queens man sentenced to 30 years for murder of detective shot by fellow officers,https://queenseagle.com/all/2022/7/7/queens-man-sentenced-to-30-years-for-murder-of-detective-shot-by-fellow-officers,nottheonion,"Prosecutors argued that Freeman, 28, was the orchestrator of two Queens T-Mobile store robberies, the second of which led to Simonsen’s death in Richmond Hill.

In February 2019, Freeman reached out to Ransom via text message and told him that should Ransom act as the muscle, stealing cash and property from the phone stores, Freeman would resell the goods and split the profits afterward, according to the charges.

The duo first struck a phone store on Linden and Farmers Boulevards on Feb. 8, 2019. Following the successful robbery, prosecutors said Freeman planned a second, again recruiting Ransom to “take all the risk,” according to prosecutor Shawn Clark.

On Feb. 12, 2019, Freeman checked into a Jamaica hotel and waited for Ransom to arrive. When he did, the pair took a taxi to the Richmond Hill T-Mobile store on Atlantic Avenue and 120th Street.

Arriving around 6 p.m., Freeman allegedly made his way across the street to watch as Ransom went inside the store with a fake gun and ski mask, and told two employees to open up the safes in the back of the store. A man outside saw Ransom enter the store with the ski mask on and called the police.

Simonsen and NYPD Sergeant Matthew Gorman, who were investigating an unconnected robbery pattern nearby, were the first to arrive at the scene. They entered the store but left to wait for more officers to arrive.

Uniform officers made their way to the scene shortly after and went inside the shop. Ransom came out of the back room, pulled out the fake gun and ran toward the front door, prosecutors said.

The police officers began to fire at Ransom, hitting him seven times. Running out of the store, he approached Simonsen as the officers continued to fire toward the suspect and the detective.

One of the shots fatally hit Simonsen in the chest. Gorman was wounded by a shot to the leg.

Freeman left the scene as the 11-second, 42-shot barrage rang out. He was arrested at a friend’s house several days later.

The district attorney’s office charged, and, ultimately, prosecuted Freeman of murder using the felony murder rule, which allows for defendants to be charged with murder if a death occurs during the commission of a felony, even if the defendant had no intention to kill or had no role in it.

It’s a controversial rule used in over 40 states, including New York. For years, criminal justice advocates have fought for the rule to be eliminated, arguing that it’s the only criminal charge that doesn't require intent.

“What is built into our law is this belief that individuals should be convicted of crimes that they committed and that they intended to commit — that’s mens rea,” Jamal Johnson, the director of Legal Aid’s Homicide Defense Task Force, told the Eagle in 2019. “For a charge that requires life [in prison] if convicted, to take away the mens rea element is profoundly unjust.”

When issuing the sentence Thursday, Holder said that “no one wanted to try this case,” because of the time and resources it would take to prove that Freeman was intimately linked to the detective’s death. However, he argued that the felony murder rule held up stronger in the case against Freeman than it does in many others, adding that any suggestion that Freeman was a “mere lookout…could not be further from the case.”

“In Ransom, you found a first class idiot to take all the risk while you sat back,” Holder said. “Maybe you thought if Ransom uses a fake gun no one will be hurt…[but] everyone thought it was real.”

Clark was less forgiving than Holder, and called Freeman a “coward.”

“A clear picture has emerged as to who is responsible for what happened,” the prosecutor said. “[Freeman] knew that [with Ransom] going in with that fake gun, something dangerous could happen.”

Freeman’s attorney, Ronald Nir, said that he disagreed with the judge’s interpretation of the felony murder rule in the case.

“No matter how you argue whether he was in the neighborhood or not, I just don't believe that Jagger was the mastermind of any of this,” Nir told the Eagle. “I disagree with them – I could see how we could appear that way, but I think it's taken out of context.”"

Arizona tells Supreme Court innocence isn’t enough in death row arguments.,https://interc.pt/3HipJN8?fbclid=IwAR1kMC3lFBZaZwe954Bhxkl-jqaPG5UZp0vZZTj80eBKvV-9otipL89ucVY,nottheonion,"The morning of the oral argument in Shinn v. Ramirez, the last case on the U.S. Supreme Court’s calendar in 2021, Barry Jones’s children gathered around a large flat-screen TV in Tucson, Arizona. Jones’s daughter Brandie was there, as well as her younger brother James. Their youngest sibling, Andrew, whom Brandie often relied upon to explain the confusing litigation in their dad’s case, was working a remodeling job in Nevada. He’d try to listen to the argument on his phone. Now in their 30s, the siblings were just kids when their dad was sentenced to die. He’d been accused of an unfathomable crime: the rape and murder of his girlfriend’s 4-year-old daughter, Rachel. Jones swore he was innocent — and the case against him was flimsy from the start. In 2017, an evidentiary hearing finally dismantled the evidence that sent Jones to death row. The next year, a federal judge overturned his conviction, ordering the state to retry Jones or release him. But that never happened. Instead, Arizona appealed the decision all the way to Washington, D.C.

The siblings gathered at the home of their aunt Deborah Wheeler for the oral argument in early December. “I’ve always believed he was innocent,” Wheeler said. Although Jones had problems with drugs when he was younger, that didn’t make him a murderer, she said. “And I know he would never hurt a little kid.” Wheeler recalled a time when Jones stayed with her while working part time at a copper mine east of Phoenix. She was struck by Jones’s kindness to her daughters, as well as her disabled son. “Barry was always so good to him,” she said. Wheeler was living in Phoenix when Jones was arrested in Tucson on May 2, 1994. Rachel’s lifeless body had been found earlier that morning in the trailer Jones shared with the child’s mother, Angela Gray. As they would later discover, Rachel had died following a rupture in her small intestine, which developed into a fatal condition called peritonitis. Although Jones was distraught after taking Rachel and Gray to the hospital, he soon became the sole suspect.

Wheeler was disturbed by the little she saw of Jones’s 1995 trial. “I remember thinking then, he had no defense, everything was just accusations,” she said. Jones’s court-appointed lawyers called no witnesses at the guilt phase apart from Brandie, who was 12 years old. When Wheeler was called to testify at the sentencing, “nobody prepared me,” she said. Had Jones’s lawyers been up to the task, there was plenty they could have done to defend their client. They could have pointed out that the lead detective, who examined Rachel at the hospital, didn’t bother to investigate how or when the child sustained her fatal injury — or consider a single other suspect aside from Jones. They could have called a medical expert to show that there was no real evidence that the child had been raped. Most crucially, Jones’s lawyers could have called a pathologist to challenge the state’s theory of the crime, which rested on a narrow timeframe during which Jones had supposedly assaulted Rachel the day before her death. Medical experts now say that Rachel’s abdominal injury could not have become fatal so quickly. One doctor said she was unaware of any reported cases in which such an injury could have resulted in death in under 48 hours. It was not until the evidentiary hearing 22 years after the trial that Jones’s federal public defenders presented this evidence, not to a jury but to U.S. District Judge Timothy Burgess. After seven days of testimony at Tucson’s federal courthouse, Burgess concluded that Jones’s trial had been marred by ineffective assistance of counsel — a violation of his Sixth Amendment rights. But for the failures of Jones’s trial attorneys, Burgess wrote, “there is a reasonable probability that his jury would not have convicted him of any of the crimes with which he was charged and previously convicted.” But the Arizona attorney general challenged Burgess’s ruling, appealing first to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which sided with Jones, and then to the U.S. Supreme Court. In their petition for certiorari, the brief asking the court to hear the case, Arizona prosecutors argued that Burgess and the 9th Circuit had violated the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act. The law, known as AEDPA, limits the avenues for challenging a criminal conviction. According to Arizona, Burgess should never have been allowed to use the evidence presented at the hearing to overturn Jones’s conviction. In May, the Supreme Court announced that it would hear the case. Jones’s attorneys had sent Wheeler a link to the oral argument. Over bacon and eggs, the family gathered to listen at 10 a.m. Tucson time. There was no video, only an image of the Supreme Court building, so it was hard to tell which of the justices was speaking — let alone what they were talking about. Jones’s family quickly got lost in the sea of legalese. “I kept asking, ‘Are they still talking about Dad?’” Brandie said. But one thing jumped out. The attorney for the state repeatedly told the justices, “Innocence isn’t enough.”

A Bellwether Case Although the question before the court is highly technical, the decision in Jones’s case will have far-reaching implications for people in prison and on death row. For those who are innocent, the stakes are uniquely high: The justices are effectively deciding whether new evidence — like that presented at Jones’s 2017 evidentiary hearing — should be ignored by the federal courts, even when it exposes a wrongful conviction. In an amicus brief filed in September, the Innocence Network, a consortium of organizations that works to correct wrongful convictions, argued that exonerations won through Sixth Amendment challenges often hinge on evidence uncovered long after a defendant’s trial. “Without such evidence, basic failures to investigate cannot be corrected, faulty forensic evidence cannot be unmasked, and the innocent individuals who are the victims of these deficiencies have no route to justice,” the brief read. News of the Supreme Court’s decision to take up Jones’s case arrived on the same day the high court announced that it would hear the Mississippi abortion case threatening Roe v. Wade. Although Jones’s case flew mostly under the radar, many legal experts saw the move as another emblem of the court’s extreme rightward shift since Justices Anthony Kennedy and Ruth Bader Ginsberg were replaced by Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. “I think that if Justice Ginsberg and Justice Kennedy were still on the court, it’s not likely they would have granted cert to begin with,” said Jones’s longtime attorney, Arizona Assistant Federal Defender Cary Sandman.

“I think it’s important to understand the antics in this case as the antics that are happening elsewhere on the court’s docket this term.”

For law professor Leah Litman, an expert in federal post-conviction review and co-host of the podcast “Strict Scrutiny,” the court’s decision will also be “a bellwether case for how extreme this court will be” on other issues. In a call with reporters in early December, Litman pointed out an amicus brief in favor of Arizona brought by the former Texas solicitor general who authored the draconian abortion law known as S.B. 8. “I think it’s important to understand the antics in this case as the antics that are happening elsewhere on the court’s docket this term,” she said. Among the small percentage of cases the court agrees to review every year, the justices have traditionally taken those that serve as vehicles for resolving conflicts between the lower courts. In Jones’s case, which was consolidated with that of another man on death row named David Ramirez under the title Shinn v. Ramirez, Arizona argued that the 9th Circuit had misconstrued a previous Supreme Court ruling, Martinez v. Ryan, in violation of AEDPA. Yet there was no dispute in the lower courts on the matter; no federal court has adopted Arizona’s argument. As Jones’s attorneys told the justices, the state sought “to manufacture a problem where none exists.” Many legal experts saw Arizona’s real goal as overturning the court’s 2012 decision in Martinez. The 7-2 ruling provided a lifeline to people in prison and on death row, who often face insurmountable barriers to getting their cases heard in federal court despite being entitled to federal review. Specifically, the decision sought to fix a long-standing problem for those who had shoddy representation at trial. Under Arizona law, defendants only had one chance following their conviction to argue in state court that their right to counsel had been violated. Although indigent defendants were given lawyers to handle this critical stage of their appeal, many were similarly unqualified or ill-prepared to represent their clients. This had grave consequences: If a state post-conviction attorney failed to challenge a trial lawyer’s performance, their client would be forever barred from bringing the claim forward in federal court, a concept known as procedural default. But Martinez created a path to relief. If a defendant had not brought a substantive ineffective assistance claim because their post-conviction lawyer, too, was ineffective, the justices decided, this default could be excused, allowing a federal court to consider the claim. Writing for the majority, Kennedy explained the importance of the ruling. For a person facing a lifetime in prison — or worse, execution — an ineffective post-conviction lawyer likely meant that “no state court at any level will hear the prisoner’s claim.” Without the remedy created by Martinez, there would be no way to uphold defendants’ Sixth Amendment right to counsel — “a bedrock principle in our justice system.” Tough Luck For Jones and Ramirez, who had been on death row for a combined 40 years when Martinez was decided, the ruling opened a door that had long been closed. Both men had been shut out of federal court after their state post-conviction lawyers failed to challenge their trial lawyers’ most egregious mistakes. Jones’s post-conviction lawyer had repeated the errors of his trial attorneys, failing to investigate the medical basis for the state’s case, which would have debunked the whole theory of the crime. After Burgess overturned Jones’s conviction, a unanimous panel of the 9th Circuit rejected Arizona’s appeal, upholding the order to release or retry him. Ramirez’s case followed a different trajectory. Convicted of murdering his girlfriend and her teenage daughter in 1989, he did not claim his innocence. But he did have significant mental impairments and a long history of childhood trauma, abuse, and neglect. Ramirez’s lead trial attorney, who had never handled a death penalty case, did not investigate this evidence. His post-conviction lawyer largely failed to do the same. Although a federal district court initially rejected Ramirez’s argument that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing in light of Martinez, a unanimous 9th Circuit panel reversed the decision, directing the court to allow the hearing.

The 9th Circuit rulings came months apart. The Arizona attorney general’s office blamed a common denominator for its defeats: not the years of incompetent lawyering now haunting the state’s capital convictions, but the fact that the Supreme Court’s Martinez ruling was allowing defendants to prove their ineffective assistance claims in federal court. In the state’s view, neither Jones nor Ramirez should have ever made it so far. Prosecutors specifically pointed to a provision of AEDPA that forbade federal courts from holding evidentiary hearings on claims that had not been developed in state court. Just because Martinez allowed defendants to bring a claim that had been previously barred did not mean they were entitled to prove it. Practically, the argument made no sense. Why would the Supreme Court dangle the chance to get back into federal court if defendants were doomed from the start? In Jones’s case, the 9th Circuit panel had seemed baffled by the rationale offered by Assistant Attorney General Myles Braccio at oral argument. He insisted that while Martinez may have allowed for the evidence uncovered by Jones’s federal public defenders to get Jones’s claim of ineffective assistance before a judge, Burgess was required by AEDPA to ignore that same evidence when deciding whether Jones’s trial lawyers had been ineffective. Instead, he should have relied on the state record. “But that doesn’t make sense if the claim wasn’t developed in state court,” one judge told Braccio. “You’d be looking at a vacuum.” Another judge called it “a Catch-22.”

Why would the Supreme Court dangle the chance to get back into federal court if defendants were doomed from the start?

Although the 9th Circuit rejected Arizona’s position — and denied its appeal for a rehearing — the state’s argument gained currency elsewhere on the bench. Judge Daniel Collins, a Trump appointee, dissented from the court’s refusal to rehear the case, accusing his colleagues of using Martinez to create a judge-made exception to AEDPA in the cases of both Jones and Ramirez. Legislators had crafted such procedural rules to ensure finality, he said. If the result seemed harsh, tough luck. “To the extent that it seems unfair that a potentially meritorious claim might escape federal habeas review, that feature is inherent in the restrictions that AEDPA imposes.” It’s true that AEDPA set a deliberately high bar for federal review, which has proven disastrous for countless defendants since its passage. But it’s not true that the law was explicitly designed to be quite as harsh as Collins or the Arizona attorney general insisted. When President Bill Clinton signed AEDPA in 1996, he emphasized that the provision barring evidentiary hearings should not be read “to deny litigants a meaningful opportunity to prove the facts necessary to vindicate federal rights.” In an amicus brief filed on behalf of Jones and Ramirez, legal scholars traced the language of this provision to show that legislators had aimed to limit hearings only when defendants were at fault for failing to develop evidence in state court. In Martinez, the Supreme Court provided a chance at relief for defendants like Jones and Ramirez on the grounds that they were not responsible for the failures of their post-conviction lawyers. Nevertheless, Collins’s dissent formed much of the basis of Arizona’s petition to the Supreme Court in Shinn v. Ramirez. The Texas attorney general, joined by a dozen death penalty states, filed a brief urging the court to take the case, “to reassert [AEDPA’s] primacy over the judge-made rule of Martinez.” After the justices granted review, a number of additional briefs were submitted on behalf of Ramirez and Jones. One, brought by a group of former Department of Justice prosecutors, warned that Arizona was trying to “transform Martinez into a hollow precedent” offering “an empty promise of judicial review.” Another, filed on behalf of former federal judges and state supreme court judges, called Arizona’s argument “absurd,” warning that a ruling in the state’s favor would make federal judges “complicit in the greatest miscarriage of justice of all — the imprisonment and execution of innocent people.”

The Problem of Innocence Shinn v. Ramirez was argued on December 8 before a mostly empty court. The justices had already heard two hours of oral arguments that morning in a case involving religion and education, which provided a stark reminder of the court’s lurch toward the right; at one point, Justice Sam Alito invoked critical race theory. Just before noon, Arizona Assistant Attorney General Brunn Wall Roysden III took his place. While the justices had spent most of the past year and a half working remotely before implementing strict Covid protocols to reconvene in person, Roysden, who goes by Beau, had spent his time challenging local mask and vaccine mandates on behalf of his boss, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich. AEDPA set a deliberately high bar for evidentiary hearings, Roysden told the court. “Congress thus spoke clearly, and the courts’ role is to apply the statutory language,” he said. “That no fact-finder could have found the prisoner guilty is not enough.” Justice Clarence Thomas asked the first question. Although he’d been one of two dissenters when the court decided Martinez almost a decade earlier, he declared it “odd” to allow a defendant to bring a previously barred claim of ineffective assistance of counsel only to forbid them from presenting the evidence to support it. “It seems pretty worthless” to excuse the procedural default in the first place, he said. “To what end?” Echoing Braccio’s argument at the 9th Circuit, Roysden said that a judge could simply rely on the state court record. Since AEDPA forbade Burgess from considering new evidence to decide Jones’s case, he should never have held an evidentiary hearing without ensuring that the state record was enough to decide the case. “It’s a fruitless exercise,” Roysden said. “But it’s a basic syllogism,” Chief Justice John Roberts interjected. “The idea is, if you do get the right to raise the claim for the first time, because your counsel was incompetent before, surely you have the right to get the evidence that’s necessary to support your claim.” Kavanaugh chimed in. If what Roysden was saying was true, then “what’s the point of Martinez?” he asked. “The court obviously carefully crafted an opinion to give you the right to raise an ineffective assistance claim, to make sure it’s considered at least once, and this would really gut that in a lot of cases.” If AEDPA and Martinez could not be reconciled, “then at the end of the day, Martinez should be overruled,” Roysden replied, finally stating outright what Arizona’s critics had identified as the real goal all along. Kavanaugh showed some resistance to the idea of overturning Martinez. “I mean, you have to assume that the court majority was unaware somehow of how this would play out,” he said. It’s not like the justices were unaware of AEDPA’s provisions when it ruled. “It’s hard to envision the court thinking that that would make any sense.” Roysden again emphasized Congress’s intent when it passed AEDPA. “Innocence isn’t enough here,” he said.

“Whether you’re innocent or guilty, you have a right to a fair hearing. You have a right to an effective trial counsel.”

Justice Elena Kagan pointed out that AEDPA’s provision prohibiting evidentiary hearings was based on the assumption that a defendant was at fault for failing to develop the evidence in state court. “But that’s not always the rule,” Kagan said. In fact, the whole basis of Martinez was that the defendants in question were not at fault, she said, citing multiple passages from the decision. “I think Martinez is not the last word,” Roysden replied. The justices seemed skeptical of Arizona’s argument. But this was far from a guarantee. When attorney Robert Loeb stood to argue on behalf of Jones and Ramirez, reiterating that, under Martinez, they were not at fault for the failures of their post-conviction lawyers, Thomas once again declared the argument “odd.” Didn’t this “basically eviscerate the restrictions of AEDPA?” he asked. Justice Samuel Alito echoed the concern while tacitly acknowledging that there was no disagreement on the matter among the lower courts. “I certainly understand why the courts of appeals have interpreted Martinez the way they did,” he said. “But the fact remains that we have to follow the federal habeas statute. We have to follow AEDPA, unless it’s unconstitutional.” Although he had joined the majority in Martinez, Alito now seemed to suggest that AEDPA had been in tension with their decision all along but no one had noticed: “The fact of the matter is that this whole … issue was not briefed by anybody in Martinez, and the court didn’t address it.” Roberts, who was also in the majority in Martinez, asked Loeb if he could point to “a case that says how we’re supposed to reconcile those two things.” Loeb responded that the two were not actually in conflict. Kavanaugh returned to the problem of innocence. Although Loeb decried the state’s argument that a federal court should “turn a blind eye” to evidence showing Jones was wrongly convicted, Arizona countered that state law offered defendants an alternate means to prove their innocence. “I have no idea whether this is sufficient, but I just want you to respond to it,” Kavanaugh said. Loeb pointed out that no one had ever successfully availed themselves of this statute. But more importantly, “whether you’re innocent or guilty, you have a right to a fair hearing. You have a right to an effective trial counsel.” Telling a defendant to rely on such a law after a trial in which their constitutional rights had been violated was like a basketball game in which one team gets five players and the other gets one — but the latter gets to shoot the ball from half court. “That does not make the game fair, Your Honor.” A Sense of Urgency A ruling in Shinn is expected in the spring. If Jones prevails, it will place him in the same position he would have been in back in 2018 had Arizona prosecutors heeded Burgess’s order to release or retry him. With the state’s evidence against Jones thoroughly discredited, the Pima County Attorney’s Office is unlikely to seek a new trial. Although the Tucson office has gained a reputation for being progressive in recent years, it has thus far declined to use its available recourses to exonerate Jones. The office’s newly revamped Conviction and Sentencing Integrity Unit, which reinvestigates possible innocence cases, refused to examine Jones’s conviction as it made its way through the federal courts. Asked whether the office might consider the case in the coming year, the new head of the unit, Jack Chin, wrote that “while I am aware of this case, I have not spent a great deal of time on it because it is not before this office now.”

COPENHAGEN. Denmark (AP) — Finland’s Prime Minister Sanna Marin said Friday she has taken a drug test “for her own legal protection” after a video was leaked of her dancing and lip-syncing songs at a private party. Marin defended her actions, saying she drank alcohol with friends but did not do any drugs.

A video posted on social media Thursday shows six people at a party dancing and lip-syncing a song, including Marin. Later in the video, the 36-year-old prime minister is on her knees dancing while lip-syncing.

“I have taken a drug test for my own legal protection, the results of which will come in about a week,” Marin told a news conference Friday, according to the Hufvudstadsbladet newspaper.

Speaking in English, Marin, the Nordic country’s youngest-ever prime minister, said she didn’t have any government meetings that weekend and “I had some time off and I spent it with my friends. And I didn’t do anything illegal.”

It was unclear when the party was held.

But the video was posted online after Finland on Wednesday decided to limit the number of visas issued to Russians beginning Sept. 1, amid a rush of Russian tourists bound for Europe. Normally there’s about 1,000 visa application appointments in Russia each day, according to the Finnish government, but that number will soon be limited to 500 a day.

Finland, Estonia and other EU countries bordering Russia have been pushing for an EU-wide ban on Russian tourists, but other EU leaders, including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, have dismissed the idea as counterproductive.

Despite bans on air travel from Russia to the European Union, Russians have been able to vacation in western Europe this summer by traveling by land through neighboring countries with tourist visas that are valid throughout Europe’s border-free travel zone.

According to the newspaper, Marin told reporters Friday that “it should be accepted that even decision-makers are dancing, singing and partying” at times. She added “it’s up to the voters (to decide) what they think about it.”

Parliamentary elections in Finland are held every four years and the last one was held in April 2019.

Critics have noted that Finland, which shares a 1,340-kilometer (832-mile) land border with Russia, faces high electricity prices among other serious fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The country recently dropped its long-neutral stance and asked to join NATO.

Marin has said previously that she will continue to have a personal life despite her job. In July, she attended a popular Finnish rock festival.

In December she apologized after going out clubbing until 4 a.m. without her work phone, hence failing to be informed that she had been in close contact with a person who tested positive for COVID-19. She didn’t test positive."
"Giant New Zealand potato is not in fact a potato, Guinness World Records rules",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/16/giant-new-zealand-potato-is-not-in-fact-a-potato-guinness-world-records-rules,nottheonion,"When is a potato not a potato? When it’s a tuber of a gourd, according to Guinness World Records.

A New Zealand couple who believed they had dug up the world’s largest potato in the garden of their small farm near Hamilton have had their dreams turned to mash after Guinness wrote to say that scientific testing had found it wasn’t, in fact, a potato after all.

Colin Craig-Brown, who first hit the tuber with a hoe last August when gardening with his wife, Donna, said it sure looked and tasted like a potato. Mind you, he added, he’s never tasted a gourd tuber.

“What can you say?” said Craig-Brown. “We can’t say we don’t believe you, because we gave them the DNA stuff.”

After months of submitting photos and paperwork, the couple got the bad news from Guinness in an email last week.

“Dear Colin,” the email begins, going on to say “sadly the specimen is not a potato and is in fact the tuber of a type of gourd. For this reason we do unfortunately have to disqualify the application.”

The couple had named their find Doug, which they took to spelling Dug, after the way it was unearthed. The tuber became something of a local celebrity, after the couple began posting photos of it on Facebook with a hat on and even built a cart to tow it around.

An official weigh-in at a local farming store put Dug at 7.8 kilograms (17 pounds), equal to a couple of sacks of regular potatoes, or one small dog. The existing Guinness record will stand, a 2011 monster from Britain that weighed in at just under 5 kg.

Craig-Brown remains a big believer in Dug, who still sits in their freezer.

“I say ‘gidday’ to him every time I pull out some sausages. He’s a cool character,” Craig-Brown said. “Whenever the grandchildren come round, they say, ‘Can we see Dug?’”

“He is the world’s biggest not-a-potato.”"
Taser abandons plans to build stun gun-equipped drones for schools,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/06/school-taser-drone-programme-paused-after-ethics-board-exodus?CMP=twt_a-education_b-gdnedu,nottheonion,"Axon, the company formerly known as Taser, has abandoned plans to build a stun gun-equipped drone intended for deployment in schools after an “exodus” of resignations from its internal ethics board.

The company’s chief executive, Rick Smith, said in a statement: “I want to be explicit: I announced a potential delivery date a few years out as an expression of what could be possible; it is not an actual launch timeline, especially as we are pausing that program. A remotely operated non-lethal Taser-enabled drone in schools is an idea, not a product, and it’s a long way off. We have a lot of work and exploring to see if this technology is even viable and to understand if the public concerns can be adequately addressed before moving forward.”

According to Reuters, the statement was made in response to the resignation of nine of the 12 members of the company’s ethics board. Smith obliquely criticised the resignations but did not directly address them, saying only that it was “unfortunate that some members of Axon’s ethics advisory panel have chosen to withdraw from directly engaging on these issues before we heard or had a chance to address their technical questions. We respect their choice and will continue to seek diverse perspectives to challenge our thinking and help guide other technology options that we should be considering.”

Axon had announced its plans late last week, framing them as a direct response to the shootings in Buffalo, New York, and Uvalde, Texas. The remotely operated drone, visualised in a mock-up as a bright yellow device bristling with cameras and weaponry, was intended to be “capable of incapacitating an active shooter in less than 60 seconds”.

Those plans were announced against the direct wishes of the company’s internal ethics board. The board had been presented with the idea of a stripped-back version of the project that would only have involved handing the technology to police departments, and still came out strongly against the proposals. But after the two shootings, Axon said, it decided to proceed anyway, and “asked the board to consider issuing further guidance”.

When the board’s guidance arrived, it was vehement: “Reasonable minds can differ on the merits of police-controlled Taser-equipped drones – our own board disagreed internally – but we unanimously are concerned with the process Axon has employed regarding this idea of drones in school classrooms.”

In Smith’s initial announcement of the proposal, he directed people towards a comic book he had co-written, called The End of Killing, in which he “described in detail how such a system could work” through an imagined counterterror operation in Syria carried out almost entirely by Taser-equipped robots."

Fulton would run over and place various items in front or behind the tires of the car, these items included Laptops, VHS tapes, and McDonald's cherry pies. Fulton would run back to his car to gain a better vantage point an would stalk his victims with the use of binoculars. The women would then be forced to bend over to see what they've driven over after hearing a crunching or squishing sound.

The Sheriff commented on Fulton's behavior, ""It's very creepy, unacceptable behavior. That's the best way to describe it. It's just creepy.""

A 25-year-old woman called the police after she discovered a laptop had been placed underneath her vehicle.

Kurt Michael Fulton was arrested and charged with, aggravated stalking with a habitual offender second offense enhancement as it was discovered that Fulton had arrested for the same crime in 2007. He is being held in Saginaw County Jail with a bond of $80,000."

A woman has been forced to flee Qatar after being sentenced to 100 lashings.

Mexican woman Paola Schietekat Sedas’ story is at the centre of a major international incident.

The senior economics adviser’s complaints have led to public shaming of the country just months out from the football World Cup, which the country is hosting for the first time under controversial circumstances.

The Qatar World Cup has been mired in allegations of human rights violations, bribery and misconduct.

The country has faced huge controversy over its human rights record, particularly its attitude towards women and gay people.

Homosexuality is illegal but application of the law — identical in both Dubai and Abu Dhabi — has become progressively more liberal.

Having an extramarital relationship is a crime in Qatar, which can be punished with up to ten years in prison and 100 lashes.

The country is permitting fans to wave rainbow flags at World Cup events this year when the tournament begins on November 21.

The outrage at the country being granted the rights to host the biggest sporting event on the planet has been further fuelled by Schietekat Sedas’ tell-all article this month, revealing the brutal details of why she fled the country.

She had been working in the country with the Organising Committee for the Qatar World Cup — and called her situation a “dream job”

However that all changed in June when she says she was sexually assaulted by a work colleague she considered to be a friend.

Her bombshell article alleges in graphic detail how her life turned into a nightmare after the colleague snuck into her room while she was sleeping.

“After a brief struggle, as his strength exceeded mine, I ended up on the floor,” she wrote, as published by El Pais.

“Hours later, I had bruises all over my left arm, shoulder and back. I kept a cool head. I told my mum, a colleague from work and I documented everything with photos, so that my memory, in an attempt to protect itself, would not minimise the events or completely erase part of them.”

She says she consulted with Mexican consulate officials before reporting her complaint to police. She says she had a medical certificate supporting her claims of abuse as well as photos detailing her injuries.

She says she was ordered to return to the police station hours later.

Police flipped the investigation on its head after interviewing the man she alleges attacked her — turning her into the accused. The alleged attacker responded to the accusation by claiming they were in a romantic relationship together.

“It was three hours of interrogation in Arabic and, at a certain point, they demanded a virginity test,” she says.

“For some reason I had become the accused. When I asked why they demanded that I give them my cell phone, they assured me that there were no charges against me, that they just wanted to verify that there was no romantic relationship between us.

“From one moment to another, my complaint no longer mattered. The police referred the case to the public prosecutor’s office, the only place where I had a translator. Everything centred around the extramarital affair.”

She says the trauma of the episode has left her still having moments where she regrets ever reporting the alleged crime.

She fled the country with the support of Mexican consulate officials and the Qatar World Cup Organising Committee.

Once she arrived safely back in Mexico she learned that her accuser had been cleared and that her case was soon to be heard at a criminal court.

She claims that her own lawyer advised her that the solution to her problem was to marry her attacker.

Her case ended when the court found her guilty of extramarital relations, sentencing her to 100 lashings and seven-years imprisonment.

Her article this month has exposed the system that betrayed her.

It is another blow to Qatar’s public relations campaign ahead of the World Cup, where the country has gone to extreme lengths to promote itself, including signing football legend David Beckham to be the face of the Qatar World Cup in a deal worth $277 million over the next 10 years.

Schietekat Sedas has slammed the international community’s indifference to Qatar hosting the event.

Qatar has also been heavily criticised over its treatment of the army of migrant workers — many from the Indian subcontinent who are labouring to build $10 billion-worth of World Cup infrastructure.

Trade union bodies and human rights organisations have calculated 1200 workers have died to date as the stadiums emerge in the blistering desert heat, a figure the Qataris dispute."
Parts of George Dawson's book deemed inappropriate for George Dawson Middle School students,https://www.fox4news.com/news/parts-of-life-is-so-good-by-george-dawson-deemed-inappropriate-for-george-dawson-middle-school-students,nottheonion,"Carroll ISD in Southlake is reviewing sections of the book Life Is So Good, co-written by George Dawson to see if it is appropriate to teach at George Dawson Middle School.

Dawson, the grandson of a slave who lived most of his life in Dallas, published the biography in 2000 after learning to read at the age of 98.

Life Is So Good looks back on Dawson's life, discussing what things were like in the 20th Century, including topics like lynching, racism, segregation and civil rights.

Carroll ISD says the book was requested to be used as part of instructional materials for a 7th grade class.

After review by a group of teachers, principals and curriculum coordinators it was determined certain sections of the book were not appropriate for 7th grade students.

The district is still reviewing which sections of the book are appropriate for instruction.

The Carroll ISD School board voted to name the middle school after Dawson in 2002. Former School Board Trustee Jerry Lawrence introduced the idea after his son heard Dawson speak in Southlake.

A YouTube video posted on the George Dawson Middle School website discusses Dawson's life and shows students reading sections of the book aloud.

Carroll ISD says Life Is So Good in its entirety was not used for instruction last year.

Wikipedia has blocked new users from editing its recession page because people kept changing the definition,https://fortune.com/2022/07/29/wikipedia-recession-definition-debate-partial-blocking-new-users/,nottheonion,"It seems that no one can agree on the definition of a recession, let alone if we’re in one right now.

Some define it as two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, no matter what other indicators—like a strong labor market—say about the economy.

But others believe that it’s not officially a recession until the non-profit National Bureau of Economic Research says it is. The NBER defines a recession as “a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months.” They often wait long after a recession has begun to make their final call.

So it should come as no surprise that the recession debate raging around the country has spilled over into a fierce editing war over the Wikipedia page for “recession,” prompting the organization to stop new users, or anyone without an account, from making whatever edits they please.

Users have edited the page more than 180 times this week, according to its history. Before this week, the page saw just 24 revisions in 2022.

A lock icon now appears over the edit button, indicating that it is “protected to prevent vandalism.”

On Thursday, the Bureau of Economic Analysis released data showing that GDP fell 0.9% between April and June, marking two consecutive quarters of economic contraction.

But on Wednesday, a Wikipedia site administrator named Anarchyte moved the recession page into semi-protected status. New users have to wait four days and make 10 edits on other pages before they can change any wording on the recession article, according to Wikipedia policy. When the pause lifts on Aug. 3, they can make edits again, but those will be reviewed by volunteer editors.

Anarchyte updated the site history, saying the page was about a “currently contentious” topic and had experienced “persistent addition of unsourced or poorly sourced content.”

The top of the recession page now warns that further updates without valid and reliable references will get removed and reads: “This article may be affected by a current event. Information in this article may change rapidly as the event progresses.”

The change even appeared to catch the attention of Elon Musk, who tagged Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales in a tweet, writing: “Wikipedia is losing its objectivity.”

The Wikimedia Foundation, a nonprofit that operates Wikipedia, told Fortune that volunteer editors—rather than any central body—control site content “using established policies around neutrality, reliable sourcing, and notability, among others, as the basis for those decisions.”

“It’s not uncommon for topics in the news to receive sudden interest on Wikipedia. Volunteer editors know this, and have created tools and mechanisms for responding to an influx of edits on articles that are in the public eye,” a spokesperson for the foundation said. “Protecting an article is one common tool they use.”

Wikipedia’s history of the page shows that most edits have gone back and forth about how to define a recession.

One user added the line: “There is no global consensus on the definition of a recession,” which someone else later removed for seeming “too vague.” Other edits disagreed on whether to place a popular definition for a recession—two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth—higher in the article or further down.

On social media, people accused the recession Wikipedia page of trying to erase that popular definition to align itself with President Biden. On Thursday, after GDP data was released, Biden rejected the idea that the U.S. is in a recession, and instead touted continued job growth, low unemployment and growing investment from manufacturers. “That doesn’t sound like a recession to me,” he said.

Although the actual recession Wikipedia page has been partially locked, editors have created a separate recession talk page for users to discuss improvements. One volunteer editor who works under the user name JPxG addressed the censorship concerns in an FAQ on the forum.

The editor discredited rumors that Wikipedia had removed mention of two quarters of negative GDP growth from its recession definition and said any screenshots implying so are outdated. He added that the article has included that part of the definition since 2011.

“As far as I can tell, nobody ever messed with this,” JPxG said. “Right now, the article gives both that definition and the NBER definition, and takes no position on which is ‘correct.’”"

The incident happened in Russia's Vyborg region, which is about 15 miles from the actual border.

The unidentified man from central Asia is accused of charging four South Asian migrants more than 10,000 euros, or $11,000, to help them cross what they believed was the EU border, Interfax reported, citing border agents.

The man is thought to have taken the migrants on an extended route along a series of roads and around a lake, while carrying an inflatable boat, the news agency reported.

The suspect faces fraud charges, and the South Asians were deported for violating migrant rules.

Russian authorities arrested a man accused of building a fake border with Finland and charging four South Asian migrants more than 10,000 euros, or $11,000, to help them cross into what they believed was the European Union, local media reported.

The suspect is thought to have constructed fake frontier posts in a forest in Russia's western Vyborg region and marked them as the state border between Russia and Finland, Russia's Interfax news agency reported on Wednesday, citing regional border-control officials working for the Federal Security Service, or FSB.

The westernmost tip of Vyborg region is about 15 miles from the Russian border with Finland.

The man is accused of charging the male migrants for guiding them across the fake state borders, taking them on an extended route by car and foot along a series of roads and around a lake while carrying an inflatable boat ""just in case,"" Interfax reported.

The incident took place last week, resulting in all five men — the suspect and the migrants — being arrested and detained.

The Vyborg district court expelled the four migrants from Russia and fined them an undisclosed amount, Interfax reported the FSB border agency as saying.

The suspect faces fraud charges, Interfax reported.

Interfax did not identify the man but said he was a citizen of one of the Commonwealth of Independent States, which consist of Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan.

It also did not say what the nationalities of the four South Asian migrants were and why they had wanted to enter the EU.

Footage posted on social media, reported by Agence France-Presse and the BBC, appeared to show the men being arrested in a fir-tree forest with their hands up.

"After their daughters were beat by a girl in sports, Utah parents triggered investigation into whether she was transgender",https://www.deseret.com/utah/2022/8/17/23310668/school-investigates-female-athlete-transgender-complaint,nottheonion,"After one competitor “outclassed” the rest of the field in a girls’ state-level competition last year, the parents of the competitors who placed second and third lodged a complaint with the Utah High School Activities Association calling into question the winner’s gender.

David Spatafore, the UHSAA’s legislative representative, addressing the Utah Legislature’s Education Interim Committee on Wednesday, said the association — without informing the student or family members about the inquiry — asked the student’s school to investigate.

The school examined the student’s enrollment records.

“The school went back to kindergarten and she’d always been a female,” he said.

To protect the student’s identity, Spatafore said he would not reveal the sport, the classification of play nor the school the student attended.

He told committee members about the events in response to their questions of whether the UHSAA, which sanctions and oversees high school activities, receives such complaints and how they are handled.

Spatafore said the association has received other complaints, some that said “that female athlete doesn’t look feminine enough.”

The association took “every one of those complaints seriously. We followed up on all of those complaints with the school and the school system,” he said during an update on HB11, a ban on transgender girls from participating in female school sports, which was passed during the final hours of the 2022 General Session.

“We didn’t get to the parents or the student simply because if all of the questions about eligibility were answered by the school or the feeder system schools, there was no reason to make it a personal situation with a family or that athlete.”

The legislation, sponsored by Rep. Kera Birkeland, R-Morgan, bans transgender girls from competing in girls sports. In the event of a lawsuit, however, the bill defaults to a commission that would evaluate transgender students’ eligibility to play.

In late May, ACLU of Utah and other advocacy groups filed a lawsuit on behalf of two transgender girls who attend public schools challenging the Utah law, alleging it is discriminatory and unconstitutional.

As a 3rd District Court judge weighs whether to issue an injunction that would temporarily halt enforcement of the law, UHSAA is striving to follow HB11 best it can, Spatafore said.

“Quite frankly, this is new ground for us. I’m not going to say that we have it down pat, because I have no clue. I don’t think any of us in the office have a clue if we have it down pat. What we want to do is we just want to try to do our job,” he said.

Birkeland said HB11 has been Utah law since July and she asked if the UHSAA’s online registration process could simply state the law.

“Despite the fact that somebody may be suing, a judge might be ruling on something, it is law,” she said.

Birkeland said passing a law takes a lot of time and work.

“I spent two years working on this legislation and then to hear that ‘well a judge might enjoin it,’ it kind of undermines our process of trying to create legislation and laws to properly govern the people that have elected us. So, I would ask, and this is just me asking, that whenever possible, state law is at least informed to the people that will be using the system,” Birkeland said.

Netflix to Subscribers: It's Not a Price Increase; It's a 'Price Update',https://tvanswerman.com/2022/02/12/netflix-to-subscribers-its-not-a-price-increase-its-a-price-update/,nottheonion,"When is a price increase not a price increase? When Netflix says it isn’t.

The streaming giant is now alerting existing subscribers that the price of their monthly plans will increase by $1-2 a month in the next month or so. Netflix announced last month that, effective immediately, it was raising the price for its three plans for new customers. The company said then it would inform existing customers in the coming weeks that their prices would increase as well and it is now doing that via e-mails.

But it’s how they are doing it that’s raising eyebrows.

A Netflix e-mail sent this week to existing subscribers carried this subject line: “We’re updating our prices — here’s why.”

The e-mail, titled ‘Updating prices to bring your more,’ Netflix writes that “we hope you’re enjoying everything Netflix has to offer. We’re updating our prices to bring you more great entertainment. Your monthly price will change to (new plan price) on March 12, 2022.

“This update will allow us to deliver even more value for your membership — with stories that lift you up, move you or simply make your day a little better.”

Netflix does not mention anywhere in the e-mail that the subscriber’s monthly price will increase, not just be ‘updated.’ Perhaps the company is hoping that subscribers won’t notice the difference.

However, some Netflix viewers do see the difference and they are registering their distaste for the Orwellian wordplay in comments on social media posts.

“This update will allow us to deliver even more value for your membership — with stories that lift you up, move you or simply make your day a little better. Sorry, this does not justify the price hike #netflix Just be honest. You want to make more money. It’s ok to admit that,” tweeted @thatthinkingman.

Trophy Hunter Gets Eaten Alive By The Brother Of The Lion He Killed For An Instagram Story.,https://rivercitypost.org/trophy-hunter-gets-eaten-alive-by-the-brother-of-the-lion-he-killed-for-an-instagram-story/,nottheonion,"

A large cat hunters remains were found after he was eaten by the pride of lions that he was hunting in the fields of South Africa.

The Lion Hunter is widely known across Instagram for his videos and pictures showing his successful hunts.

The man was heard screaming from a distance by people outside near the South African city of Phalaborwa.

But the lions quickly eliminated their prey and had already eaten most of his body before being chased off, leaving his head untouched.

Police at first thought the man was a tractor driver who worked nearby until they seen he was still streaming on Insgram Live and identified the man.

Burglar steals $20K in items from business specializing in security cameras,https://www.wkrn.com/news/local-news/nashville/burglar-steals-20k-in-items-from-nashville-business-specializing-in-security-cameras/,nottheonion,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WKRN) — Pro Systems is a communications company in South Nashville that has been around since the eighties and specializes in security cameras. But when employees arrived at work just weeks ago, they found their fence cut, and about $20,000 worth of items stolen.

The company, of course, reviewed their own equipment and handed over surveillance footage to the Metro Nashville Police. Within hours, officers were able to identify and arrest the suspect seen on the business’ security cameras.

Pro Systems said quality equipment and security are some of the best ways business owners can protect their property.

“Doing security, as far as the cameras and everything, it really helps to have good lighting, good quality cameras, good coverage,” said Brandon Russell, Project Technical Advisor. “The more details you have, the better information you can provide, and that might help to alleviate the situation.”

Pro Systems was able to recover most of the materials that were stolen and are now discussing new ways to be proactive when it comes to protecting their business."
Reptile hailed as world's first four legged snake turns out to be just a lizard,https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2022/01/reptile-hailed-as-world-s-first-four-legged-snake-turns-out-to-be-just-a-lizard.html,nottheonion,"A new investigation into a creature hailed as the world's first ""four-legged snake"" on its discovery has revealed it's actually just a lizard.

A study published in 2015 claimed a 120 million-year-old fossil discovered in Brazil, dubbed Tetrapodophis amplectus - Greek for ""four-footed serpent"" - was the first snake to have more than two limbs. Other early snake fossils only had two.

But scientists in the Canada said they doubted the findings from the start, so did their own study of the fossil, the University of Toronto said in a release this week.

""I was so upset about this kind of poor science making it into a top journal in the sciences,"" said biology professor Robert Reisz.

""Soon after the original publication, we secured access to the specimen by raising hell and then we were able to study it. And we basically went and did our detective work properly and we came up with a much more plausible alternative explanation that this is not a snake, but a little lizard.

For a start, its skull is more ""lizard-like"" than snake-like, lacking the ability to separate bones to swallow prey whole. Its teeth were also more like those of a lizard than a snake - the latter having curved incisors to stop live prey from escaping."
"Amazon sues 10,000 Facebook group admins over fake reviews",https://www.itv.com/news/2022-07-20/amazon-sues-10000-facebook-group-admins-over-fake-review,nottheonion,"Amazon is suing more than 10,000 Facebook groups administrators over fake reviews the e-commerce giant says were written in exchange for money or free products.

Facebook groups were set up to recruit people “willing to post incentivised and misleading reviews” across its stores in the US the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Japan, Amazon said.

Those behind such groups solicit fake reviews for hundreds of products available for sale on Amazon, including car stereos and camera tripods, the company said.

Amazon said one of the Facebook groups it is targeting, called “Amazon Product Review,” had more than 43,000 members.

The group was removed this year by the social media company, Amazon said, but it was able to dodge the platform’s detection by “changing letters in phrases that might set off Facebook’s alarms”.

Amazon has more than 12,000 employees around the world dedicated to protecting its stores from fraud and abuse, including fake reviews.

Amazon said it has reported more than 10,000 fake review groups to Meta, the parent company of Facebook, since 2020. Meta has removed half of these groups and is investigating the others, Amazon said.

Amazon was a pioneer of product reviews, having introduced them in 1995 to help customers make more informed shopping decisions. The company claims it has stopped more than 200 million suspected fake reviews in 2020 alone.

This is not the first time Amazon has tackled fake reviews and has previously sued people it said were giving fake testimonials, though regulators have questioned whether the company was doing enough to combat the issue.

In a statement, Meta added: “Groups that solicit or encourage fake reviews violate our policies and are removed. We are working with Amazon on this matter and will continue to partner across the industry to address spam and fake reviews.”

Last year, the UK competition's watchdog launched a probe into Amazon and Google over fake and misleading reviews.

The Competition and Markets Authority opened a formal investigation into whether the two tech giants have done enough to crack down on the practice. It questioned whether the two are doing enough to investigate and promptly remove fake and misleading reviews from their platforms, and impose adequate sanctions on reviewers or businesses engaged in the practice.

Amazon's lawsuit against the social media giant comes as the parents of Nora Quoirin, a French-Irish schoolgirl from London whose body was found near a Malaysian jungle resort during a family holiday, settled a case over posts made on Facebook in 2019 and 2020.

Counsel for the social media giant – trading as Meta – said in a statement: “During what was a distressing time for the Quoirin family in the course of Nora’s disappearance and in the aftermath of her subsequent discovery, a Facebook user posted a series of allegations that were disturbing and offensive to Nora’s parents on the Facebook platform.

“Meta Platforms Ireland Limited appreciates that the user’s allegations were distressing to the Quoirin family and takes this opportunity to express its sympathy for the distress and trauma arising from that user’s allegations.

"Utah company ""Lions not Sheep"" busted for switching made in China tags, for made in USA tags.

The Utah-based apparel company known for its inflammatory T-shirts that often espouse pro-Second Amendment and pro-Trump messages was ordered to pay a hefty fine for falsely claiming some its products were made entirely in the U.S. (Ben B. Braun, Deseret News)

Estimated read time: 3-4 minutes

SALT LAKE CITY — A Utah-based apparel company known for its inflammatory T-shirts that often espouse pro-Second Amendment and pro-Trump messages was ordered to pay a hefty fine by the Federal Trade Commission for falsely claiming some its products were made entirely in the U.S.

Lions Not Sheep and its owner Sean Whalen were hit with a $211,335 fine last week after the FTC found the company removed ""Made in China"" tags, replacing them with phony ""Made in the USA"" labels, according to a news release.

It's the latest development after a complaint was filed by the FTC in May.

A reference to the saying ""a lion doesn't lose sleep over the opinion of sheep,"" the company made waves during the pandemic in response to mask mandates and COVID-19 restrictions, with shirts that read ""give violence a chance,"" depict Donald Trump as the Terminator and frequently feature military-style rifles.

The company also has a celebrity roster that includes mixed martial arts fighter Donald ""Cowboy"" Cerrone, Robert J. O'Neill, who claims to be the sole Navy SEAL who killed Osama bin Laden, and motorcycle racer Davi Millsaps.

In addition to the fine, the company was directed to stop making ""bogus"" made in the U.S. claims and to ""come clean about foreign production.""

Lions Not Sheep now needs to prove the product's final assembly or processing takes place in the U.S. ""and that all or virtually all ingredients or components of the product are made and sourced here"" before it tells customers the apparel is American-made.

""Any qualified Made in USA claims must include a clear and conspicuous disclosure about the extent to which the product contains foreign parts, ingredients or components, or processing,"" the news release reads.

""Finally, to claim that a product is assembled in the United States, Whalen and Lions Not Sheep must ensure that it is last substantially transformed in the United States, its principal assembly takes place in the United States, and U.S. assembly operations are substantial.""

Under its Frequently Asked Questions page, the company's website explains the process of ""white labeling,"" where the raw materials are often purchased outside of the country, but assembled in the U.S.

It details how the company buys from manufacturers based in China, Colombia and Bangladesh, ships the blank apparel to facilities in the U.S. for printing, embroidering and tagging, then ships the finished product to the Lions Not Sheep headquarters in Utah.

But according to the FTC complaint, Whalen posted a video to social media claiming he could ""conceal the fact that his shirts are made in China by ripping out the origin tags and replacing them with tags stating that the merchandise was made in the United States.""

The complaint specifies that from May 10 to Oct. 8, 2020, Whalen removed tags that disclosed where the products were made. The company's shirts had labels that read ""Made in the USA,"" ""Made in America,"" ""Are your products USA Made?"" ""100% AMERICAN MADE,"" and ""BEST (expletive) AMERICAN MADE GEAR ON THE PLANET.""

Lions Not Sheep did not respond to a request for comment.

"Complaint: Green Bay woman dismembered man’s body, placed head in bucket",https://www.wbay.com/2022/03/01/green-bay-woman-24-arrested-west-side-homicide/?fbclid=IwAR1MecwDYZsyqzT5cpWMfzv0aHy5vW4i-zQzmP0QJJnFK0_wwzCyAK_n8Do,nottheonion,"GREEN BAY, Wis. (WBAY) - Officers found a severed head in a bucket at a home on Green Bay’s west side and body parts in other locations in scenes reminiscent of a gory horror movie.

Taylor D. Schabusiness, 24, is charged with 1st Degree Intentional Homicide, Mutilating a Corpse and 3rd Degree Sexual Assault. A court commissioner set her bond at $2 million cash at a hearing Tuesday afternoon. Schabusiness seemed calm when she appeared in Brown County court via video conference. She said very little, only acknowledging that she has the right to an attorney.

The prosecutor called this “one of the most serious offenses we’ve had in this county in some time.” The state argued Schabusiness has ties to Texas, raising a concern she’s a flight risk. The prosecution also said Schabusiness was on put on probation 7 weeks before the crime and supposed to be wearing an electronic monitoring bracelet but apparently removed it somehow.

“I think the facts alleged are extremely concerning and disturbing and go to the violent nature and grave nature of the offense,” Assistant District Attorney Caleb Saunders said in court.

WARNING: THE DETAILS OF THIS STORY MAY BE DISTURBING FOR SOME READERS.

We first told you last Wednesday about a suspicious death investigation underway on Green Bay’s west side on the 800-block of Stony Brook Lane. The criminal complaint goes into detail, saying on Feb. 23, at about 3:25 A.M., police were called to the home by a person living there who reported finding her son’s severed head in a bucket.

The woman told police she heard a door slam between 2 and 3 A.M., waking her. She went to check on a light left on downstairs and made the gruesome discovery.

Dried blood was found on a nearby mattress.

Police learned that Taylor Schabusiness may have been the last person to be seen with the victim, identified only as a 25-year-old man. They found her at a home on Eastman Avenue. She had dried blood on her clothing.

Police searched Schabusiness’s van and on the rear passenger seat. They found a crock pot box with “additional human body parts including legs,” according to the criminal complaint.

Police obtained a search warrant for the home on Stony Brook Lane, which belonged to the victim’s mother. In addition to the human head, they found a “male organ” in the bucket. They found “body fluid” and knives.

In a storage tote, they found an upper torso.

Police interviewed Schabusiness and asked her what happened. She replied, “That is a good question.” Schabusiness said she and the victim were together all day Tuesday and had been smoking meth. After they arrived at the Stony Brook home, they were having sex and incorporated chains. Schabusiness said she blacked out during part of it but just went “crazy” and started strangling the victim.

Schabusiness told investigators she did not mean to kill the victim but she enjoyed choking him and continued to do it. Prosecutors say the sexual assault charge is for acts that happened after the victim died.

“Schabusiness responded that the police were going to have fun trying to find all of the organs as she dismembered the body. Schabusiness stated all of the body parts should be in the basement. Schabusiness stated there should be a foot or a leg in the minivan. Detective Graf asked Schabusiness what she did with the head, and Schabusiness stated she had put the Victim’s head in a black bucket and put a blanket over it,” reads the criminal complaint.

The complaint continues, “Schabusiness stated she used knives that she obtained from the kitchen of the residence and that a bread knife worked the best because of the serrated blade. Schabusiness stated the knives should be in a black bag along with the body parts in the basement. Schabusiness indicated that she would use whatever bags she found in the basement to place the body parts into. Schabusiness made the comment that at one point, she did get paranoid and lazy and that she thought it was the ‘dope’ that was making her paranoid.”

“Schabusiness stated the plan was for her to bring all of the body parts with her but she got lazy and only ended up putting the leg/foot in the van and she forgot the head,” reads the complaint.

Police, forensic teams and the Dane County Medical Examiner’s Office investigated and processed multiple locations associated with the crime.

Police met with the victim’s family Tuesday. Officials have not released the victim’s name but are asking for privacy for his family.

Schabusiness is scheduled to be back in court in three weeks.

Lottery Winner Keeps $30 Million Jackpot Secret From Wife and Child,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/lottery-winner-keeps-30-million-jackpot-secret-from-wife-and-child-1.1839861,nottheonion,"A man in southern China is keeping his 219 million yuan (US$29.9 million) lottery jackpot a secret from his wife and child, saying he was worried that the winnings might make them lazy.

The man identified only as Mr. Li went alone to the lottery office in Nanning, in the southern region of Guangxi, to claim his prize, the Nanning Evening News reported. He wore a bright yellow costume that covered his head in photos showing him accepting the prize.

“I didn’t tell my wife and child for fear that they would be too complacent and would not work or work hard in the future,” the man told the newspaper last week.

He donated 5 million yuan to charity and said he hadn’t decided what to do with the rest. He collects some 171.6 million yuan after taxes.

The man bought the winning ticket in a shop in Litang, a town of some 120,000 people just east of the regional capital of Nanning, the Nanning Evening News said. The day after he realized he won, he drove to the bigger city to present the ticket at the lottery headquarters.

“I only slept in a hotel because I was afraid to go out and lose the lottery ticket,” he said.

An earlier version of this story misstated the currency of the lottery winning

China’s central government runs lotteries to raise money for welfare and sports. Players in Guangxi pick six numbers on red balls and one on a blue ball. The man said his winning numbers were ones he’d been playing for years: 2, 15, 19, 26, 27, 29 and 2."

Gov. Abbott attributes mass shootings to mental health issues a month after cutting $211 million from mental health commission,https://www.ksat.com/news/local/2022/05/30/gov-abbott-attributes-mass-shootings-to-mental-health-issues-a-month-after-cutting-211-million-from-mental-health-commission/,nottheonion,"UVALDE, Texas – “We as a state - we as a society - need to do a better job with mental health. Anybody who shoots somebody else has a mental health challenge. Period. We as a government need to find a way to target that mental health challenge and do something about it.”

Those are the words of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott just days after an 18-year-old high school student massacred 19 students and two teachers at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde.

Abbott has doubled down on his stance that mass shootings are an issue of mental health and not gun access following the Uvalde massacre.

However, in April, Abbott slashed nearly $211 million from the Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC), which oversees mental health services in Texas.

Abbott diverted the funds to add to his effort to send National Guard to the Texas-Mexico border, currently known as Operation Lone Star.

No other Texas agency received a more significant cut than the HHSC when Abbott slashed funding.

The massive cut comes as Texas ranks 44th in the U.S. for an overall ranking of mental health measures and last out of all 50 states in access to mental health care, according to the 2022 State of Mental Health in America report.

The Texas Legislature has spent billions in the last decade funding DPS’ so-called border security mission, even though few metrics exist to measure its success.

Some of those operations have occurred in and around Uvalde, which is just under 100 miles from the border.

In fact, Abbott’s office directed $3.3 million to Uvalde County in February for county law enforcement agencies to help “prosecuting border-related crimes including drug and human smuggling, and related criminal trespassing and evading arrest,” the Uvalde Leader News reported.

On Friday, Abbott discussed the option of passing new laws to make sure that schools are safer. He again attributed the issue to mental health and specifically not to gun access or violence.

“You can expect a robust discussion, and my hope is laws passed, that I will sign, addressing health care in this state. There is an array of healthcare issues that we face as a state in general but there are an array of healthcare issues that relate to those who commit gun crimes in particular. Those need to be addressed,” Abbott said. “... If there’s anybody here who thinks we have perfect health care in this country or in this world - they’re wrong. If there’s anybody who thinks we can’t do more to address mental health care - they’re wrong. We can and we’re going to.”

Tesla now monitors how often you adjust your seat position and will disable controls for 'chronic abusers',https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-now-monitors-how-often-you-adjust-your-seat-position-and-will-disable-controls-for-chronic-abusers/,nottheonion,"Tesla often takes advantage of the connected nature of their cars for good. They have warned owners of potential problems with their cars, or notified them to limit charging to help ease pressure on the grid during times of excessive demand.

They have also used it for other purposes some might consider “not good,” like tracking the number of times the passenger lumbar controls were adjusted, resulting in the removal of the feature altogether.

Now Tesla has taken a new approach that could fall into the “not good” category by monitoring how many times you adjust your seat.

Based on a review of the source code by hacker @greentheonly, the automaker recently added “seat abuse” metrics.

According to green, if you move the seat too much messages will pop up on the display like “Excessive use of seat track motor detected,” and “Seat track motor unavailable due to excessive use.”

Green did not say what the thresholds were to receive these messages, but it looks like if you ignore them, Tesla will even go so far as to disable the controls and put you seat adjustment jail with the message “Wait 5 minutes to adjust the seat position again.”

UPDATE Jan 31 10:31am PST: With the high amount of interest in this story, green dug a little further to discover the thresholds – 90 seconds of use in 5 minutes will trigger the warning message, while 120 seconds of use in 5 minutes will disable the motor. Given those high thresholds, the vast majority of owners won’t have to worry about having their seat controls disabled.

You are probably wondering why Tesla would implement a seemingly trivial thing like seat abuse metrics.

While we don’t know for sure, we do know Tesla collects a lot of data about their cars. They have likely seen an increasing trend in damage or failure of seat motors, and in an attempt to keep warranty costs down, decided it was a good idea to add this feature.

Along with the new code, green also noticed that Tesla appears to have a new front seat vendor for the Model 3 and Model Y – Brose, an automotive supplier based in Coburg, Germany.

ha, they are also introducing ""seat abuse"" metrics complete with disabling of seat moving for busers with helpful messages like ""Excessive use of seat track motor detected""""Seat track motor unavailable due to excessive use"" and ""Wait 5 minutes to adjust seat track position again"" — green (@greentheonly) January 27, 2022

Colorado lawmakers want to spell it out: It’s perfectly legal for kids to play outside or walk to school alone,https://coloradosun.com/2022/02/18/child-abuse-neglect-play-outside/,nottheonion,"Brinley Sheffield and her mom had run the route several times together and tracked the mileage — two trips around their neighborhood block made a mile.

So when the 7-year-old who wanted to become a faster runner set off on her first solo run, her parents had no concern that she would get lost. Besides, they could keep her in their sights for about half of the jog.

What they hadn’t considered is that someone might call the police.

The fact that a police officer knocked on the Sheffields’ door minutes after Brinley finished her run is one of the reasons behind a bipartisan plan to clarify Colorado’s child abuse laws. Lawmakers from both parties are wholeheartedly backing the proposal, even while expressing bewilderment that Colorado needs to specifically state that it’s not illegal for kids to play outside by themselves. Or go to the park. Or ride a bike to school.

“I regret that we have to make this a law,” said Rep. Mary Bradfield, a Republican from Colorado Springs. “There is a portion of our society that is pretty uptight and can’t allow a kid to be a kid.”

Rep. Iman Jodeh, an Aurora Democrat, said the legislation promotes the idea that kids should play outside more and watch screens less. “I love this bill,” she said, describing how she played outside without parents watching when she was a kid, heading home only when the streetlights came on. “Those were the most enriching years of our childhood.”

House Bill 1090 passed 13-0 out of the House human services committee and passed its first vote in the full House on Thursday. Notably absent from Capitol testimony, though, was the state child welfare division, which for years has run public service campaigns to encourage more people to call the statewide child abuse and neglect hotline.

The Colorado Department of Human Services understands the intent of the bill, but is taking a neutral stance, spokesman Mark Techmeyer said via email. “It affirms that age-appropriate childhood activities, such as traveling to and from school, playing outside, or staying at home alone are not alone considered maltreatment according to Colorado law and practice if a prudent parent would consider these activities safe.”

Still, Techmeyer emphasized that it’s important that the public call the hotline if they have a concern about a child’s safety. “Neighbors look out for one another,” he said.

Brinley, now 12, noticed a car following her when she was out for a run in her Castle Rock neighborhood. When the police officer arrived at her door, she assumed he was there to say he had arrested the person who had been creeping along the neighborhood street in a car as she ran. The girl burst into tears when she thought the officer was there to tell her that what she did was illegal.

“My first thought was that they found the person that followed me and they were going to put them in jail,” Brinley told lawmakers. “But then I realized that the officer was there because of me. I started to cry because I was scared. I thought I was going to get in big trouble.”

The officer, upon realizing Brinley was just fine and that her mom knew she went for a run, did not make a report to child protective services. But the incident rattled her mom, Christa Sheffield, who wondered why someone would watch a child walk into her own house and then call the police. The mother of five said she is trying to raise independent children, kids who learn to handle issues on their own because they haven’t always had a parent hovering.

As parents have grown more fearful of kidnappings and other crimes, they’ve restricted kids’ freedom, Sheffield said in an interview. “We decided we need to keep our hands on kids a little bit tighter, rather than empowering them,” she said.

Another mom told lawmakers that parents who homeschool their children are sometimes the subject of child abuse hotline or police calls because their kids are playing outside during school hours. “Once a family is in the system they are guilty until proven innocent, the very opposite of what our judicial system affords us in the name of liberty,” said April Hawley, with Christian Home Educators of Colorado. “Parents have a fundamental right and responsibility to make decisions concerning the care, custody and control of their children.”

The point of the bill is mainly to make a statement: no need to assume young kids playing outside, walking to school or staying home alone are neglected. It also aims to decrease unnecessary involvement in the child welfare system, lawmakers said.

In reality, most calls to the child abuse hotline to report lack of supervision are unsubstantiated. Of 3,854 allegations of lack of supervision in 2019, 82% of them were unfounded, said Rep. Mary Young, a Greeley Democrat and a prime sponsor of the bill along with Rep. Kim Ransom, a Douglas County Republican.

But even when the allegations are eventually dropped by the child welfare department, getting called by child protective services or the police is anxiety-provoking, Young said. “That means that families, children were impacted by this identification process,” she said. “This really has a negative impact.”

Also, families of color are more likely to be the subject of reports to the hotline, according to data from the Colorado Department of Human Services. Black children are the focus of calls to the child abuse hotline 1.27 times more than their percentage of the population in Colorado. White kids, meanwhile, are underrepresented in hotline calls relative to their representation in the state population.

Low-income families are less likely to pay for supervised activities or sports teams, meaning those children are more likely to play outside alone, bill supporters said.

A similar bill was cruising through the legislature in 2020, but was abandoned when the pandemic forced a Capitol shutdown. The measure faces one more vote in the House before heading to the Senate, where its prime sponsors are Aurora Democrat Janet Buckner and Douglas County Republican Jim Smallwood.

Francis, speaking to a delegation from the Agenzia delle Entrate, Italy’s revenue agency, encouraged the tax collectors to keep working to redistribute wealth and help the poor.

Francis acknowledged that the group is often seen as an agency that is “putting your hands in other people’s pockets, but that what they do is a valuable service.

“In reality, taxation is a sign of legality and justice,” he said. He went on to urge the wealthy to pay their fair share.

“It (taxaction) must favor the redistribution of wealth, looking out for the dignity of the poorest who risk always ending up crushed by the powerful,” he said. “Let us work so that the culture of the common good grows and — this is important — so that the universal destination of goods is taken up seriously.”

He also praised people who pay the taxes they owe, the AP reported.

Francis said that while tax collectors are not so popular on Earth, they do have a patron saint in heaven.

Polish murderer on the run arrested for not wearing facemask,https://www.euronews.com/2022/01/04/polish-murderer-on-the-run-for-20-years-arrested-for-not-wearing-facemask,nottheonion,"By AFP

Police in Poland have arrested a convicted murderer who had been on the run for 20 years because he was not wearing a face mask.

Warsaw police said they had detained the 45-year-old fugitive at a shop northeast of the capital.

""The man was stopped by police in the Bielany district because he did not have a mask,"" sub-inspector Elwira Kozlowska told AFP on Tuesday.

The man has now been transported to a prison where he is due to serve a 25-year sentence for murder. No further details were provided.

Facemasks are mandatory in all shops in Poland under the latest anti-coronavirus restrictions."
"Haunted house customer gets scared, shoots performer, police say",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/haunted-house-customer-gets-scared-shoots-performer-police-say,nottheonion,"A trip to a haunted house resulted in a bigger scare than anyone planned, when a patron of the Hollywood Wax Museum Haunted House in Myrtle Beach, S.C., shot one of the workers, cops say.

Police arrested Keal Latrell Brown after speaking to witnesses and viewing video of the incident, which took place Saturday night. According to a Facebook post by the Myrtle Beach Police, Brown was with a group of people who got scared by the victim, who was one of the performers.

SOUTH CAROLINA COURT HALTS PLANNED FIRING SQUAD EXECUTION

""One person in the group fell to the ground, and during the scramble, a gun slid back and struck Brown in the foot,"" the post said.

Police say Brown told investigators afterward that he thought at the time that the gun was a prop part of the show when he grabbed it from the floor and fired it twice. Police say the victim was struck once in the shoulder.

"Ivermectin: New study didn't, in fact, find it was effective against omicron",https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/ivermectin-new-study-did-not-in-fact-find-it-was-effective-against-omicron,nottheonion,"Early on in the pandemic, ivermectin was one drug some doctors tested to see if it could be repurposed as a COVID-19 treatment. The antiparasitic had seemingly positive effects on some patients, however, more studies showed it had little to no effect when it comes to treating the disease. One new study in Japan is being touted by COVID misinformation peddlers as proof of ivermectin's effectiveness, but that's not the case.

A study from Japanese trading and pharmaceuticals company Kowa found ivermectin did have an ""antiviral effect"" on the SARS-CoV-2 virus, according to a Monday report from Reuters that was later corrected. What wasn't made clear in the initial story was that this effect was already known, and limited to ""joint nonclinical research,"" meaning it showed that effect in test tubes. Ivermectin still hasn't shown any effectiveness in treating COVID.

Here's what you need to know about ivermectin.

What is ivermectin?

Ivermectin is an antiparasitic medicine that cures diseases such as river blindness and scabies by paralyzing and killing the parasites. It can also inhibit some viruses from infecting cells, thus preventing the virus from spreading, like with dengue fever.

The drug isn't common in the US. There were 146,212 prescriptions written for ivermectin in 2019, according to the drug database ClinCalc. In comparison, the cholesterol-lowering atorvastatin, better known under the brand name Lipitor, hit 112 million prescriptions that same year. Ivermectin was primarily prescribed as a lotion, which is common to treat lice and scabies.

Where ivermectin is used more frequently is in developing countries where parasites are more common and deadlier.

""Ivermectin provides significant health benefits in treating parasitic diseases, especially in areas of extreme poverty in low middle-income countries,"" said Dr. Gerald W. Parker, associate dean for Global One Health, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at Texas A&M University.

Scientists at pharmaceuticals giant Merck discovered ivermectin in 1975 and began using it in 1981 to treat scabies, river blindness and other parasitic diseases carried by worms and lice. It's on the World Health Organization's list of essential medicines for a basic health care system. More than 250 million people take the drug across the globe each year, and it's effective for animals as well. The researcher who developed ivermectin received the Nobel Prize in 2015.

The drug is considered safe when taken in appropriate dosages. Side effects for ivermectin vary depending on whether it's taken orally to treat intestinal infections or topically for skin infections. Oral tablets can cause drowsiness, nausea, vomiting and, in very rare cases, an increase in heart rate and the onset of seizures. Side effects for the topical ivermectin can include skin rash and irritation, while dry skin and stinging pain are severe and rare.

Can ivermectin be used to treat COVID-19?

The US Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, the World Health Organization and other agencies don't suggest ivermectin's use to treat COVID-19. They cite the lack of data from large, randomized trials confirming the drug's effectiveness to treat the disease.

Some doctors who cite multiple smaller studies and firsthand experience say otherwise. They claim ivermectin does work to prevent people from developing symptoms from COVID-19 and can shorten recovery time for those already infected. Many of those studies, however, have issues because of small numbers of participants, poor methodology or flawed data.

What do public health agencies say about ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment?

The discussion isn't new. The FDA said in March 2021 that it hadn't approved the use of ivermectin to treat COVID-19. It warned that large doses of the drug are ""dangerous and can cause serious harm."" The agency also advised against the human use of ivermectin produced for animals, such as cows and horses, as the doses aren't the same and could contain ingredients intended only for animals.

However, as the delta variant created yet another wave of the pandemic this summer, a growing number of people began taking ivermectin intended for animals as word spread on social media about the medication's possible use against COVID-19. That's despite public health experts warning people against it because it's dangerous.

The use of livestock ivermectin has resulted in some people calling state poison centers after taking the drug and experiencing negative and sometimes disturbing side effects. In August, the Mississippi State Department of Health sent out an alert regarding the number of calls its poison center received, with 70% related to the ""ingestion of livestock or animal formulations of ivermectin purchased at livestock supply centers."" Similar stories came from other states, including Oklahoma, Utah and Alabama, where poison centers have been receiving more calls from people who took too much of the drug. There were also two deaths linked to ivermectin, as confirmed by the New Mexico Department of Health.

The FDA reaffirmed in a post published in April on its website that ivermectin isn't approved to treat COVID-19 nor has it been given emergency use authorization. Then in August, it tried a different approach to get people's attention, tweeting: ""You are not a horse. You are not a cow. Seriously, y'all. Stop it.""

The NIH said in February 2021 that there was insufficient data to ""recommend either for or against the use of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19."" It did say lab tests found the drug stopped the reproduction of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes the disease. However, to be effective, the dosages would need to be ""100-fold higher than those approved for use in humans.""

While some clinical studies showed ivermectin to have no benefit, the NIH said other studies saw a lower mortality rate among patients. However, those studies were incomplete or had methodological limitations such as small sample sizes or patients receiving additional medicine along with ivermectin, according to the NIH.

The World Health Organization said in March that the current evidence on the use of ivermectin for treatment of COVID-19 was ""inconclusive.""

The American Medical Association, American Pharmacists Association and American Society of Health-System Pharmacists say they ""strongly oppose the ordering, prescribing, or dispensing of ivermectin to prevent or treat COVID-19 outside of a clinical trial.""

Who says ivermectin is a treatment, and what information do they have?

Ivermectin's potential use as a COVID-19 therapeutic made headway in December 2020 during a US Senate Homeland Security Committee meeting called Focus on Early Treatment of COVID-19. Dr. Pierre Kory, a pulmonary and critical care specialist, testified about the drug's use for the treatment of the disease. But there were several problems with the information he cited.

""Ivermectin is highly safe, widely available, and low cost,"" Kory said in the Senate meeting. ""We now have data from over 20 well-designed clinical studies, 10 of them randomized, controlled trials, with every study consistently reporting large magnitude and statistically significant benefits in decreasing transmission rates, shortening recovery times, decreasing hospitalizations, or large reductions in deaths. These data show that ivermectin is effectively a 'miracle drug' against COVID-19.""

During his testimony, Kory referred to a paper he authored -- Review of the Emerging Evidence Demonstrating the Efficacy of Ivermectin in the Prophylaxis and Treatment of COVID-19 -- that was published in the May 2020 edition of the American Journal of Therapeutics.

The paper was also included in the Frontiers of Pharmacology journal in January 2021 but was then removed in March. Dr. Frederick Fenter, chief executive editor of the journal, said the paper was removed due to ""strong, unsupported claims based on studies with insufficient statistical significance, and at times, without the use of control groups."" Fenter also said the authors promoted their own specific ivermectin-based treatment, which goes against editorial policies.

The studies listed in Kory's paper tend to be for a small number of participants and have a questionable methodology. For example, a study of 234 uninfected health care workers in Argentina found those who received the drug were far less likely to be diagnosed with COVID. A BuzzFeed News report was unable to find confirmations that this trial even occurred as the hospital it purportedly was conducted in says its health care workers weren't included in a test.

An Iraq study saw a quicker recovery time with using ivermectin, but the test was done on only 70 patients. In a small double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial in Israel with a group of 89 patients, those taking ivermectin saw lower viral loads than those who didn't receive the drug.

There are also studies that show otherwise. A clinical trial of 476 patients found ivermectin didn't improve the recovery time in patients who had COVID-19. A review of 10 random clinical trials, with more than 1,000 participants, also didn't find improvements with ivermectin. One Egyptian study claimed to show positive results, but it's since been redacted over ethical concerns. Another study, of 1,500 patients, found that ivermectin had ""no effect whatsoever.""

One thing to note is that many of these studies have yet to be peer-reviewed.

Merck, the company that created ivermectin, released a statement in February 2021 saying there was ""no scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies"" and ""no meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease."" It also cited a lack of safety data from major studies.

Why is there a controversy over ivermectin?

The debate about ivermectin's usage to treat COVID-19 has gone from the hospital to social media, exacerbating the discourse as well as the vitriol. While those in support of the drug appear to want an end to the pandemic, their arguments in favor of ivermectin have become fodder for anti-vaccine activists and conspiracy theorists.

COVID vaccines have been shown to decrease the chance of hospitalization and death. According to the CDC in January, individuals who received a booster shot were 68 times less likely to die than those unvaccinated.

Groups that have spread misinformation about COVID-19 throughout the pandemic latched onto ivermectin's use following Kory's Senate testimony. Anti-vaccine groups on social media and messaging app Telegram share misinformation about the vaccine while asking where they can buy the drug. Rumble, an alternative video platform to YouTube, has pages of videos falsely saying vaccines are ineffective while advising people to take ivermectin.

One study on the effectiveness of ivermectin took place at the Center for Pediatric Infectious Diseases Studies, in Cali, Colombia. Luis Robayo/AFP via Getty Images

Anti-vaccine posts and videos can also be found on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, though the companies are attempting to take these posts down or make them harder to find.

Kory was a guest on the Dark Horse Podcast hosted by Bret Weinstein, a former professor at Evergreen State College, in June 2021 to talk about ivermectin. That video was eventually demonetized on YouTube and Weinstein's channel received a strike, which prevented him from posting content for one week and could have led to its removal if he received two more strikes within 90 days.

YouTube says its actions on Weinstein's videos were part of its policies.

""While we welcome open discussions of potential treatments and clinical trials related to COVID-19 on YouTube, based on guidance from the CDC, FDA and other local health authorities, we don't currently allow content that recommends ivermectin as an effective treatment or prevention method for the virus,"" said Ivy Choi, a YouTube spokesperson. ""We craft our policies to prevent the risk of egregious real-world harm, and update them as official guidance evolves. We do allow exceptions to our policy about ivermectin, including content that also gives viewers the full context of the FDA's current position.""

Because of YouTube's decision, the controversy over ivermectin grew and became tied to what some claim to be ""big tech censorship.""

Two New Mexicans died due to ivermectin, as first spotted by Albuquerque news station KOB on Sept. 22, 2021, and confirmed by the state's department of health. One of the individuals who died was reportedly battling a serious case of COVID-19.

""Drugs should only be used as directed, and ivermectin is not a viable treatment for COVID-19,"" said David Morgan, New Mexico Department of Health media and social media manager.

What big studies are happening right now?

Large clinical studies are being conducted around the world.

""There is a large, ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled trial in the United Kingdom, so officially the jury is still out to see if ivermectin may offer clinical benefit,"" said Dr. Parker. ""But so far there is no indication to use ivermectin as a patient or prescribe as a physician, other than in an approved clinical trial.""

The Oxford University Principle Trial is seeking to work with more than 5,000 participants and give a three-day course of oral ivermectin treatment to individuals randomly and compare their results to individuals who receive standard care. However, the study was put on hold in December due to supply issues.

In the US, the NIH is evaluating therapeutics for COVID-19 with its Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV) master protocol. Ivermectin was added in phase three of ACTIV-6, which will test the effectiveness of repurposed drugs.

""The ACTIV prioritization group, trial team and trial oversight groups continuously track new data on any agent we are studying in our trials and evaluate that data for how it might influence our testing of that agent and the safety/well being of the participants in the trial,"" said Dr. Sarah Dunsmore, a program director at the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, which is part of the NIH.

Results for this study will be released sometime in the first quarter of 2022.

Both Merck and Pfizer have antiviral pills that were authorized by the FDA in December to treat COVID-19."
"Amazon “suicide kits” have led to teen deaths, according to new lawsuit",https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/10/amazon-suicide-kits-have-led-to-teen-deaths-according-to-new-lawsuit/,nottheonion,"Lawyers, who are representing parents suing Amazon for selling “suicide kits” to teenagers who died by suicide, say they have reached a “breaking point.”

Amazon lawyers have allegedly told parents that the online retailer had a right to sell these so-called “suicide kits."" The kits are described in the lawsuit as bundled items that Amazon suggests buyers purchase together, including a potentially lethal chemical called sodium nitrite, a scale to measure a lethal dose, a drug to prevent vomiting, and a book with instructions on how to use the chemical to attempt suicide. The online retailer’s lawyers also allegedly said that it would be “unfair and inhumane” to hold Amazon liable for the teens’ deaths.

One of the parents’ lawyers, Carrie Goldberg, took to Twitter yesterday, alleging that Amazon’s corporate ties with news outlets like CBS are effectively working to silence media attention for their lawsuit, while more lives likely remain at risk.

“For months, we avoided press attention to this case,” Goldberg, founder of C.A. Goldberg, PLLC, told Ars in a statement. “But we have reached a breaking point of too many people dying, of medical providers not knowing what is happening or that a treatment protocol exists, and of press spiking stories about it—presumably because of corporate ties to Amazon.”

In her tweet thread, Goldberg claimed that a producer told her that CBS canceled a pair of 60 Minutes segments on the lawsuit—after CBS requested an exclusive—because “higher-ups at CBS quashed the story.” Allegedly, the producer said these executives “didn’t want to risk anybody dying from suicide on account of their segment.” Ars found that CBS News has previously in 2020 reported on lethal uses of sodium nitrite and last month did a 60 Minutes segment on child suicides.

Parents allegedly told Goldberg that CBS canceling was understandable because “everyone is afraid of Amazon.” Goldberg tweeted that parents also noted that CBS has a partnership with Amazon Prime.

Goldberg tweeted that the law firm had extensively communicated with CBS ahead of connecting their clients to CBS reporters to ensure that CBS had experience reporting on suicide and knew how to sensitively handle the segments. After receiving assurances from CBS and a commitment that the segment would air, Goldberg set up a Zoom with parents suing. Her concern was that the interviews could retraumatize her clients, and that, to them, it was only worth enduring that emotional duress if by talking to CBS they could raise awareness for the suffering they’d endured.

“CBS’ failures have been demoralizing and deeply confusing,” Goldberg tweeted. “If it was really about not wanting to report on suicides, why did they assure us so many times they knew how to handle it?”

CBS did not immediately respond to Ars’ request for comment. An Amazon spokesperson provided a statement to Ars, saying, “We extend our deepest condolences to the families and loved ones personally affected by suicide. Customer safety is a top priority at Amazon. We are committed to a safe shopping experience and require our selling partners to follow all applicable laws and regulations when listing items in our store.”

According to the complaint, “Amazon defends its right to sell sodium nitrite (and other products known to be used for suicide) because it says some states immunize defendants that cause a personal injury where that injury occurred during an attempted or completed suicide.”

Amazon appears to bundle items into “suicide kits”

In their complaint filed in a California court, parents claimed that—despite it being illegal for anyone, including corporations, to assist or aid in suicide—Amazon is the No. 1 “vendor of sodium nitrite used for suicides” and has been “knowingly assisting in the deaths of healthy children by selling them suicide kits.”

Also named in the lawsuit is an Amazon seller, Loudwolf, which is described as the No. 1 “brand of sodium nitrite sold by Amazon.”

Loudwolf did not immediately respond to Ars’ request for comment on how much sodium nitrite it sells on Amazon. The lawsuit claims that Amazon has also failed to supply this information. Earlier this year, Amazon failed to meet a deadline set by a congressional inquiry (following a New York Times investigation into the matter) to confirm “the number of units of sodium nitrite"" that Amazon sold. The lawsuit says that Congress expressed concern in a letter to the online retailer that Amazon provides “minors and adults with easy access to sodium nitrite, a deadly chemical.”

Both teen suicide cases described in the lawsuit illustrate how easy it can be for teens to quickly access the chemical on Amazon.

In the first case, a teen named Kristine started experiencing suicidal ideation when the pandemic isolated her from seeing friends in September 2020. Kristine hid her feelings from her family but registered on an online forum called Sanctioned-Suicide.org, where the lawsuit says users increasingly link to Amazon to encourage others to buy sodium nitrite as a preferred suicidal method."
Twitter says Musk’s spam analysis used tool that called his own account a bot,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/08/twitter-says-musks-spam-analysis-used-tool-that-called-his-own-account-a-bot/,nottheonion,"Twitter yesterday slammed Elon Musk's response to the company's lawsuit in a 127-page filing in the Delaware Court of Chancery that says Musk's claims are ""contradicted by the evidence and common sense."" Twitter's court filing also said Musk's spam analysis relied on a tool that once called his own Twitter account a likely bot.

""According to Musk, he—the billionaire founder of multiple companies, advised by Wall Street bankers and lawyers—was hoodwinked by Twitter into signing a $44 billion merger agreement,"" Twitter wrote. ""This story is as implausible and contrary to fact as it sounds. And it is just that—a story, imagined in an effort to escape a merger agreement that Musk no longer found attractive once the stock market—and along with it, his massive personal wealth—declined in value.""

Twitter's filing was in response to Musk's defense and counterclaims, which were submitted last week but not made public immediately because Twitter was given time to request redactions. Twitter apparently chose not to make any redactions.

""Musk's Counterclaims, based as they are on distortion, misrepresentation, and outright deception, change nothing. Musk signed and is obligated to consummate the merger agreement,"" Twitter wrote.

Twitter: Musk used tool that labeled his account a bot

Musk has defended his attempt to break the merger agreement by questioning Twitter's public disclosure that less than 5 percent of its monetizable daily active users (mDAU) are spam or fake. Twitter's court filing said Musk's own analysis used a publicly available website to find ""that false or spam accounts constitute at least 10 percent of Twitter's monetizable daily active users,"" but ""Musk is not measuring the same thing as Twitter or even using the same data as Twitter.""

""Musk can produce a higher estimate only by running a data set neither limited to nor inclusive of mDAU through a generic web tool that designated his own Twitter account a likely 'bot.' The result is a distortion that Musk is hoping will nonetheless make waves,"" Twitter said. Advertisement

Specifically, Musk used ""an Internet application called the 'Botometer'—which applies different standards than Twitter does and which earlier this year designated Musk himself as highly likely to be a bot,"" Twitter said.

The Botometer website is a project of the Observatory on Social Media and the Network Science Institute at Indiana University. Citing a May 2022 Protocol article, Twitter's court filing said that ""the Botometer indicated that Elon Musk's own Twitter account was likely a bot, scoring it 4/5.""

Musk’s Botometer score now more “human-like”

This morning, Botometer gave Musk's account a rating of 1.2 out of 5, indicating that Musk is more ""human-like"" than bot-like as of today. Protocol's article in May noted that Musk's account was getting wildly different Botometer scores from one day to the next, saying the tool ""highlights just how hard it is to identify bots, especially using only public data.""

As Twitter's court filing noted, ""the Botometer's own FAQ website cautions that 'Bot detection is a hard task' and that if it 'were easy to do with software, there wouldn't be any bots—Twitter would have already caught and banned them!'""

Twitter's filing described other problems with Musk's reliance on the Botometer as follows:

The Botometer thus does not even purport to apply Twitter's definition of a false or spam account. In fact, some bots (like those that report earthquakes as they happen or updates on the weather) are often helpful and permissible under Twitter's platform manipulation and spam policy, to which Twitter respectfully refers the Court. Moreover, Defendants have not indicated what score they are applying to conclude an account constitutes spam; thus, their allegation is unverifiable.

Musk already lost one important ruling when Court of Chancery Judge Kathaleen McCormick expedited the trial, rejecting Musk's request to delay it until February 2023. The five-day trial is now scheduled to begin on October 17."
Lay's Reveals New Potato Chips Made from Potatoes Grown in Dirt Taken from NFL Stadiums,https://www.brandeating.com/2022/01/lays-reveals-new-potato-chips-made-from-potatoes-grown-in-dirt-taken-from-nfl-stadiums.html,nottheonion,
Doctor no longer allowed to practice after branding patients' livers with his initials,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/simon-bramhall-doctor-brand-patients-livers-uk/,nottheonion,"A doctor in the U.K. has been removed from the country's medical register for branding patients' livers with his initials. The incidents occurred in February and August 2013, when Simon Bramhall used a surgical device to write his initials on transplanted livers at the end of two surgeries.

The 1.6-inch initials were discovered by another doctor when an organ transplanted by Bramhall failed after about a week, according to BBC News.

In 2017, Bramhall pleaded guilty and was convicted of two counts common assault, according to documents from the U.K.'s Medical Practice Tribunal Service, known as MPTS, which hears complaints against doctors and determines if they are fit to practice. He was fined £10,000 ($13,619.90 U.S. dollars) and sentenced to community service.

Bramhall had resigned from his job at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital in 2014 and had been suspended from practicing for at least five months in December 2020, according to BBC News.

However, MPTS invited Bramhall to have his case reviewed in December 2020. The service reviewed evidence in the case, including statements from Bramhall, in which he stated he ""foolishly made a mark on the adjacent liver"" and admitted his actions in 2013 ""were stupid and entirely wrong,"" according to the MPTS documents.

Bramhall's legal counsel argued that the former doctor's ""fitness to practice was no longer impaired,"" and ""that this case had never been about his surgical skills; rather it was about Mr. Bramhall's lack of respect for the dignity of the patients.""

MPTS ""was satisfied that there is no discernible risk of repetition"" of the incident and said Bramhall's fitness to practice is ""no longer impaired by reason of conviction."" The order that suspended him from practice was revoked.

However, the case was re-submitted to MPTS, and during a hearing on Monday, the service said it ""accepted that no lasting physical damage was caused to either patient,"" but that Bramhall's actions had caused one of them ""significant emotional harm,"" according to BBC.

While they said Bramhall was of ""previous good character,"" removing him from the medical register was the appropriate punishment and even though he provided life-saving care, he was still in ""gross violation of his patients' dignity and autonomy.""

After the hearing, an immediate suspension was put in place, but Bramhall has a 28-day appeals period. CBS News has reached out to MPTS and Bramhall for comment and is awaiting response.

A yearlong CBS News investigation found that the system responsible for licensing and disciplining doctors in the U.S. — state medical boards — often fails to police doctors who repeatedly hurt their patients. For patients in the U.S., the CBS News investigative unit put together this state-by-state guide that shows how to check your doctor's license and disciplinary history along with information on how to file a complaint against a healthcare provider in your state."
Adidas ends partnership with Ye over antisemitic remarks,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/adidas-ends-partnership-with-ye-kanye-west-over-antisemitic-remarks/#app,nottheonion,"Adidas has ended its partnership with the rapper formerly known as Kanye West over his offensive and antisemitic remarks, the latest company to cut ties with Ye and a decision that the German sportswear company said would hit its bottom line.

""Adidas does not tolerate antisemitism and any other sort of hate speech,"" the company said in a statement Tuesday. ""Ye's recent comments and actions have been unacceptable, hateful and dangerous, and they violate the company's values of diversity and inclusion, mutual respect and fairness.""

The company faced pressure to cut ties with Ye, with celebrities and others on social media urging Adidas to act. It said at the beginning of the month that it was placing its lucrative sneaker deal with the rapper under review.

Adidas said Tuesday that it conducted a ""thorough review"" and would immediately stop production of its line of Yeezy products and stop payments to Ye and his companies. The sportswear company said it was expected to take a hit of up to 250 million euros ($246 million) to its net income this year from the move. The company is the sole owner of the design rights to Yeezy, Adidas said.

Adidas' deal with West officially started in 2016, with the company the time calling it ""the most significant partnership ever created between an athletic brand and a non-athlete.""

Other companies drop Ye

Jewish groups said the decision to drop Ye was overdue.

""I would have liked a clear stance earlier from a German company that also was entangled with the Nazi regime,"" Josef Schuster, president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, the main Jewish group in the country where Adidas is headquartered.

Adidas is just the latest company to end connections with Ye, who also has been suspended from Twitter and Instagram over antisemitic posts that the social networks said violated their policies.

Earlier this month, Ye tweeted a threat that he would go ""death [sic] con 3"" on Jewish people, alluding to a defense readiness designation used by the U.S. military. He also posted a screenshot of a text exchange with Sean ""Diddy"" Combs in which he suggested Combs was being controlled by Jews.

West recently suggested slavery was a choice and called the COVID-19 vaccine the ""mark of the beast,"" among other controversial comments. He was also criticized for wearing a ""White Lives Matter"" T-shirt to his Yeezy collection show in Paris. The phrase has been adopted and promoted by white supremacist groups and sympathizers, according to the Anti-Defamation League.

Ye's talent agency, CAA, dropped him, and the MRC studio announced Monday that it is shelving a complete documentary about him. Ari Emmanuel, CEO of talent firm Endeavor, last week penned an op-ed in the Financial Times urging all enterprises to stop working with Ye over his antisemitism.

The Balenciaga fashion house cut ties with Ye last week, according to Women's Wear Daily. Foot Locker also said it would stop carrying the Yeezy brand and pull Yeezy shoes from its shelves and online sites. JPMorganChase and Ye have ended their business relationship, although the banking breakup was in the works even before Ye's antisemitic comments.

""Although Adidas was somewhat late in cutting ties with Kanye West, it has now yielded to the inevitable and ended its partnership with the artist,"" Neil Saunders, managing director of market research firm GlobalData, said in an email. ""Given the baseness of Ye's recent comments, and the fact his words are now stirring up antisemitism among others, Adidas had no choice but to act in order to protect its reputation and show customers it is on the right side of morality.""

A Vogue spokesperson confirmed Tuesday that the magazine and its global editorial director, Anna Wintour, have no intentions of working with Ye again after his most controversial remarks and behavior.

In recent weeks, Ye has also ended his company's association with Gap and has told Bloomberg that he plans to cut ties with his corporate suppliers. Gap said Tuesday it is removing all Yeezy Gap products from the retailer's stores and its e-commerce site.

""Antisemitism, racism and hate in any form are inexcusable and not tolerated in accordance with our values,"" the apparel chain said in a statement.

Demonstrators on a Los Angeles overpass Saturday unfurled a banner praising Ye's antisemitic comments, prompting an outcry on social media as celebrities and others said they stand with Jewish people.

In 2021, Bloomberg ranked West as the wealthiest Black American, pegging his net worth at $6 billion. Morningstar analyst David Swartz told the Washington Post that Yeezy product sales generated roughly $2 billion a year for Adidas, or nearly 10% of its annual revenue.

Adidas shares fell more than 3% in trading on Tuesday and are down 61% this year.

Adidas doesn't break out Yeezy sales numbers, but the impact will be more severe than expected given that the brand has ended production of all Yeezy products and ceased royalty payments, according to Morningstar analyst David Swartz in a note published Tuesday.

Swartz projects overall Adidas revenues to reach $23.2 billion euros ($23.1 billion) this year, with the Yeezy brand generating 1.5 billion to 2 billion euros ($1.99 billion), or nearly 10% of the total. The pricy brand accounts for up to 15% of the company's net income, Swartz said."

Texas Judge Says HIV Drug Mandate Violates Religious Freedom,https://news.bloomberglaw.com/health-law-and-business/judge-says-hiv-drug-coverage-violates-religious-freedom,nottheonion,"A federal judge in Texas ruled that the Affordable Care Act’s mandate for free coverage of groundbreaking HIV prevention drugs made by Gilead Sciences Inc. “substantially burdens” the religious freedom of a Christian-owned company.

US District Judge Reed O’Connor in Fort Worth on Wednesday granted summary judgment to Braidwood Management Inc. in its challenge to coverage of Gilead’s Truvada and Descovy. The two pre-exposure prophylactic drugs, commonly known as PrEP, are taken daily by hundreds of thousands of Americans, particularly men who have sex with men.

The suit is being led by attorney Jonathan Mitchell, the Republican former solicitor general of Texas known for his efforts to restrict abortion access in the state. Mitchell argues that mandatory PrEP coverage forces Christians to subsidize “homosexual behavior”

O’Connor, a George W. Bush appointee, said the government failed to demonstrate a state interest in providing coverage of the drugs that overcame the plaintiffs’ religious objections.

“The government defendants in the suit “outline a generalized policy to combat the spread of HIV, but they provide no evidence connecting that policy to employers such as Braidwood,” the judge wrote. “Thus, defendants have not carried their burden to show that the PrEP mandate furthers a compelling governmental interest.”

The ruling is the latest win for conservatives who support a broad interpretation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a 1993 law that has been used to challenge access to abortion and contraception and to block equal protection for the LGBTQ community.

“This ruling is about imposing extreme religious beliefs -- not, as it purports, about protecting religious freedom,” said Ivy Hill, community health program director of the Campaign for Southern Equality. “Far-right extremist judges are attacking privacy and access to health care.”

US Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman Rachel Seeger declined to comment or say whether the government might appeal the ruling. HHS “continues to work to ensure that people can access health care, free from discrimination,” she said in a statement.

The judge reserved deciding the “appropriate remedy” for resolving the claim, and it’s unclear what impact the ruling will have beyond the plaintiff company, which employs about 70 people. He said there was no evidence that the government couldn’t assume the cost of providing PrEP drugs to people who are unable to obtain them from religious employers.

PrEP drugs can cost as much as $20,000 a year, according to the ruling.

Task Force Unconstitutional

In another win for the plaintiffs, O’Connor ruled the US Preventive Services Task Force, or PSTF, which makes recommendations for what qualifies as a covered preventive measure under the ACA, is unconstitutional because it “wields a power to compel private action that resembles legislative authority.”

“Because PSTF members are principal officers, they must be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate,” O’Connor said. “The PSTF members indisputably fail that constitutional requirement.”

The judge also reserved ruling on the appropriate remedy for dealing with that alleged violation.

O’Connor dismissed a claim that challenged the preventive mandate itself, though it’s unclear how the provision might be affected by the rest of the ruling.

Mitchell seeks to block the entire preventive services mandate under the ACA, arguing it’s invalid because the government employees who manage the list have too much power to not be confirmed by the Senate. Depending on O’Connor’s remedy in the case, that could have a far-reaching impact nationwide, putting at risk requirements for no-cost access to other services, like care for pregnant women and infants.

O’Connor didn’t entirely side with Mitchell. The judge ruled that two other bodies involved in ACA preventive services, the Health Resources and Services Administration and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, were properly empowered under the constitution. The judge also ruled that the Preventive Services Task Force doesn’t violate a separate provision of the constitution.

The case is Braidwood Management Inc. v. Becerra, 4:20-cv-00283, US District Court, Northern District of Texas (Fort Worth).

O’Daniel Automart allegedly sold Dewey Fredrick a Jeep in 1986 which he claims had a faulty engine, and that the dealership ‘refused to make it right’. It’s not the first time Fredrick sought his revenge – during the ‘80s he also tried to glue several of the dealership’s cars’ doors shut.

CCTV footage of 79-year-old Dewey Fredrick shows him pulling up in his pickup to the first dealership’s lot in Fort. Wayne, Indiana. He started the fire by opening the fuel door on a Jeep Compass and sticking a road flare into the opening, before torching another car on a neighbouring dealership’s lot."

Eric Clapton claims YouTube is using subliminal advertising to keep the masses subservient – in an interview posted to YouTube,https://guitar.com/news/music-news/eric-clapton-youtube-using-subliminal-advertising-keep-masses-subservient-interview-posted-youtube/,nottheonion,"Following on from being interviewed by Robert F Kennedy and claiming the COVID-19 vaccine impacts fertility, Eric Clapton has embraced a new pseudoscientific concept, one proposed by several anti-vaccine figures. Clapton has now cited the controversial Mass Formation Psychosis/Hypnosis argument in an attempt to explain why he has faced criticism for his viewpoints, and why people believe that vaccines are effective.

Eric Clapton made the claim during a recent appearance on The Real Music Observer channel on YouTube, a rock music interview and gossip channel with a strong anti-lockdown and anti-vaccine perspective. The channel frequently describes anyone with pro-vaccine views as the “hivemind”, and “complete morons.” People who refuse to be vaccinated, however, according to The Real Music Observer, are not “morons” – they are simply people who refuse to “go along with the government narrative” and “love freedom.”

The channel also exclusively refers to the vaccine as “the thing,” presumably to bypass YouTube’s anti-misinformation policies, which place clarifying notes on videos discussing the vaccine. The policies also ban the outright spreading of misinformation surrounding the vaccine.

During his appearance on the channel, Clapton was asked how we got here – “here” referring to the recent widespread criticism of Clapton, particularly in the wake of him sharing his own experience with vaccine side-effects. Clapton noted that when he told friends and family about his plans to write and record anti-vaccine and anti-lockdown songs with Van Morrison, they were worried on his behalf. “So I thought, why are they? What’s going on here?”, he said.

“There seemed to be some sort of – I didn’t get the memo, whatever the memo was, it hadn’t reached me. Then I realised there really was a memo – a guy, Mattias Desmet has talked about it. It’s great, you know, the theory of mass hypnosis formation.

“And I could see it, once I kind of started to look for it. I saw it everywhere. And then I remembered seeing little things on YouTube, which were like subliminal advertising, It’s been going on for a long time – that thing of ‘you will own nothing and you will be happy.”’

The irony of his claim being made in an interview being uploaded to YouTube seemed to be lost on Clapton. However, according to him, it’s not just YouTube – he also stated that news coverage in the UK from the start of the pandemic became “one-way traffic about following orders and obedience.”

Clapton calls the theory Mass Hypnosis Formation, although it is more commonly referred to as Mass Formation Hypnosis or Mass Formation Psychosis. It essentially posits that, due to a lack of social connection and the uncertainty caused by the pandemic, the public is able to be hypnotised en-masse. In this case, a dictatorial higher power has caused them to blindly buy into a false narrative: getting vaccinated will end the pandemic. Proponents of the theory claim variety of nefarious motives, ranging from subtle erosion of freedom to outright genocide via unsafe vaccines.

If that all sounds like a paranoid conspiracy theory to you – you’re not alone. The theory made headlines recently when podcaster Joe Rogan hosted anti-vaccine virologist Dr Robert Malone on his show to talk Mass Formation Psychosis. Malone is the most prominent proponent of the theory and has argued that Mattias Desmet based it on years of published science. Experts disagree – the appearance of Malone on Rogan’s podcast prompted a group of doctors, health experts and scientists to call on Spotify, which hosts Rogan’s podcast, to create a misinformation policy.

Medpage Today summed Malone’s viewpoint up, writing: “Malone posits that promoting messages encouraging people to get vaccinated against COVID-19, among other scientifically validated pandemic communications, is an attempt to hypnotize groups of people to follow these messages against their will. Think Nazism, he has said.”

There have been zero peer-reviewed studies about Mass Formation Hypnosis or Mass Formation Psychosis published on PubMed, which collates millions of biomedical books and journals. However, the phrase is frequently used as a pejorative one in conspiratorial memes, mocking the vaccinated masses for their stupidity and stating that they are complicit in some evil scheme.

For Clapton, the theory won’t be falsified by an article like this. Guitar.com could continue to point out the rocky scientific ground upon which Mass Formation Psychosis/Hypnosis is based, and how Clapton has repeatedly shared misinformation surrounding the safety of the vaccine. However, the theory is based on the idea of manipulation and control via the media, and is frequently defended with claims of censorship. Therefore, if we do so, we are simply part of the system of control hypnotising the masses. How convenient."
A new religion has been founded in Japan that prohibits staying at work,https://pictolic.com/en/article/a-new-religion-has-been-founded-in-japan-that-prohibits-staying-at-work,nottheonion,"A person's religious beliefs, excuse the pun, are a sacred matter. If a young man cannot hold a weapon in his hands according to the canons of his faith, he can be released from military service. Imagine that your boss categorically declares that you need to stay after work, and you confidently refuse. Yes, not just like that, but because of his faith. ""No overwork and overtime!"" is the first and only commandment of the new mTop religion. Oddly enough, she appeared in the most industrious country in the world — in Japan.

""Believe and go home, I tell you!"" is how the new messiah Motohiro Hisano teaches the adherents of his faith. It sounds defiant, but only for those who do not know this guy personally. The founder of the new faith is the most humble and honest spiritual leader of the planet. Hisano openly says that there are no divine principles in him, he has not seen angels and is not endowed with magical power.

Moreover, Motohiro does not even require donations from his adherents. The guy's only goal is to get behind him and his co-religionists, especially at work. The young Japanese founded his sect in 2018. He called it simply - ""Motohiro to People"" (Motohiro to People) or mTop.

Hisano's only ability that gives him to the ""chosen ones"" is the power of ""religious reasons"". He generously gives it to those who joined his temple. In Japan, there is a law punishing any discrimination on religious grounds at work. The faith of ""Motohiro - people"" is based on timely going home, which is difficult for bosses to challenge with such a submission.

For many Japanese, such a religion can be a real salvation. Every year, thousands of people in their prime die from overwork during processing in the Land of the Rising Sun. There is even a term describing death from grueling work — karosi. People die from heart attacks and strokes so often that the problem is being discussed at the level of the country's government.

When Hisano decided to change the world with the help of a new faith, he was only 19 years old. The young man did not find the prospect of dying at work at all tempting. For the Japanese, it is normal to work 60 or more hours a week, because it is not accepted to refuse overwork. Motohiro gave people hope, or rather, a reason to give up overtime without hesitation.

The new faith does not stand still, but develops and acquires new laws and principles. It is no longer just about processing - the young Japanese touched on other areas of life. For example, his religion forbids giving up maternity leave, paid vacations and sick leave. Also, believers can not go to boring corporate parties and parties. Religion does not allow it, and this is quite enough.

You can become a follower of Motohiro only on Twitter, on the official mTop page. Now there are more than 12 thousand believers, and the religion began with only 700 adherents. mTop and its followers look funny, but they are still useful. The news about the faith prohibiting recycling quickly spread around the world and attracted the general public to the problem."
Walmart argues fire departments made Walmart distribution center fire worse,https://www.wishtv.com/news/local-news/tort-claim-argues-fire-departments-made-walmart-distribution-center-fire-worse/,nottheonion,"Tort claim argues fire departments made Walmart distribution center fire worse

PLAINFIELD, Ind. (WISH) — Walmart says fire departments responding to a massive distribution center fire made the fire worse.

That’s the issue in a tort claim filed by the insurance company behind Walmart’s policy.

The town of Plainfield received the notice earlier this month.

On March 16, numerous fire departments responded to the Walmart distribution center at 9590 Allpoints Parkway.

A “notice of potential claim” received on Sept. 6 states, “We further understand the Plainfield Fire Department improperly shutdown the fire suppression system before the fire was fully contained, resulting in significant damage.” That same letter states that damages exceeded $150 million.

Other documents argue that firefighters made the fire worse by opening doors at the facility, allowing oxygen in and making the fire spread more quickly.

Around 200 firefighters responded to the fire.

“Just about every fire department in central Indiana is responding,” Joe Aldridge, deputy chief with the Plainfield Police Department, said at the time.

In April, it was announced that the facility was closing for good.

Wayne Township Fire Department told News 8 in a news release issued Friday night that it’s aware it’s one of the departments named in a tort claim."
Massachusetts family wins $5 million verdict from country club after property hit by over 600 golf balls,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/massachusetts-family-wins-5-million-verdict-country-club-property-hit-rcna25857,nottheonion,"A Massachusetts couple won a verdict worth nearly $5 million against a local country club after suffering from the years-long, ""continuous threat"" of wayward golf balls struck by hackers.

A Plymouth County Superior Court jury awarded Erik and Athina Tenczar $4.93 million in December, finding that Indian Pond Country Club was at fault for not protecting the couple's home from a constant barrage of bad golfing, court records showed.

Golf balls collected by Erik and Athina Tenczar at their home in Kingston, Mass., on April 21, 2022. Jonathan Wiggs / Boston Globe via Getty Images

The Tenczars originally sued both Indian Pond and Spectrum Building Inc., which built their new home in Kingston, about 40 miles south of downtown Boston. They settled with the builders, leaving Indian Pond Country Club as the sole defendant.

“The continuous threat of golf ball strikes occurring at any time prevents the Tenczars from the use and enjoyment of their property,” which was purchased for $750,000 on April 27, 2017, according to the complaint.

The Tenczars' attorney, Robert Galvin, said he understands skepticism about his clients' dismay over errant golf balls, knowing they were buying property that abuts the 15th hole.

But the inconvenience of an occasional backyard golf ball pales in comparison to the 651 dimpled spheres that have struck their property, Galvin said.

There have been ""multiple broken windows,"" according to the lawsuit and one particularly jarring shot on July 18, 2018 that ""struck a window in the home shattering the glass and terrifying the plaintiffs' young daughter and resulting in the Tenczars contacting the Kingston Police Department to file a report.""

""They thought they were buying golf-course-view property and what they ended up buying was a golf-course-in-play property,"" Galvin told NBC News on Monday. ""It was apparent to anyone that this house was going to be struck as repeatedly as this one was, they would have never bought this property.""

A lawyer for Indian Pond Country Club could not be immediately reached for comment on Monday. The judgement is being appealed with the defense arguing that $4.93 million is excessive, according to Galvin.

The couple's home is at the bend of a severe leftward curve in the course. So golfers seeking to ""cut the dogleg"" would regularly blast off the tee in hopes of clearing a tree line — but end up hitting the home instead, the Tenczars claimed.

But now the couple and their three young daughters hope the problem could be solved as the tee box on 15 has been moved back, disincentivizing golfers from their attempted shortcut and instead encouraging more simple shots that follow the dogleg, Galvin said."
Real life Overwatch 2 charm costs less than it does in game,https://www.pcgamesn.com/overwatch-2/charm-real-life,nottheonion,"You can buy an official Blizzard Overwatch 2 charm in real life for less than it costs for its in-game equivalent, causing players to further query the pricing of the free game’s microtransaction model. The removal of loot boxes from the first game in the switch to an Overwatch 2 battle pass model with paid cosmetic items has led many fans of the Blizzard FPS game to take issue with the high price of Overwatch 2 skins.

A post on the Overwatch Reddit highlights the discrepancy between the two prices. The Overwatch Pachimari Jinx 3D Keychain is available on the Blizzard US gear shop for $5 USD, along with several other 3D options at the same price point including Mei’s companion Snowball, Reaper’s mask, and Bastion’s bird pal Ganymede. For comparison, the equivalent Pachimari charm in-game costs 700 Overwatch Coins, with 1000 coins retailing for $9.99 USD.

This would price the in-game charm at roughly $7 – two bucks more than its actual, real-world equivalent that you can hold in your actual hands, or use to keep your keys company. It even comes with more pleasingly bouncy physics than the rather stiff chains on the in-game models. Were you to opt for Overwatch’s most pricey coin bundle, netting you 11,600 coins for $99.99 USD, you’d still be paying just over $6 for your in-game charm.

Things don’t quite work out as dramatically for those of us in the UK, where the real-life keychain charms retail at £8 GBP compared to about £5.87 worth of in-game coins. Nevertheless, it’s still worth bearing in mind that we’re talking about an actual, tangible item with manufacturing costs that you can use in real life, as opposed to a small (but admittedly cute) in-game art asset.

Ultimately, this comparison has simply provided another drop of fuel on the fire that is the Overwatch 2 monetisation discussion. Comments in the Reddit thread seem to be largely of one mind – warning, “Careful, they might update the merch store prices if they find out.” Some users note that quite a few items in the Blizzard gear shop have gone up in price in the past few years, and that $5 for a piece of officially licensed merch is actually a pretty good deal.

Many fans in the thread recognise that making an in-game item isn’t ‘free’ either – the model has to be designed and made by artists on the development team – but note that once it exists, there’s no additional overhead to serving it up to each player. Ultimately, only time will tell how Overwatch 2’s financial model plays out and whether Blizzard decides to make any changes to in-game pricing in the future.

"Dolphin stranded on Texas beach dies after crowd tries to ride the animal, rescuers say",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/animal-news/dolphin-stranded-texas-beach-dies-crowd-tries-ride-animal-rescuers-say-rcna24467,nottheonion,"A dolphin stranded on a Texas beach died after a crowd of people ""harassed"" the animal and tried to ride it, rescue officials said.

The female dolphin washed up on Quintana Beach Sunday evening and was reportedly pushed back to sea while beachgoers tried to ""swim with and ride the sick animal,"" the Texas Marine Mammal Stranding Network said in a Facebook post.

""She ultimately stranded and was further harassed by a crowd of people on the beach where she later died before rescuers could arrive on scene,"" the organization said.

Harassing stranded sea animals causes stress and can also be dangerous for the people who interact with them, but it is also illegal, rescue officials said in the post.

Violating the Marine Mammal Protection Act could lead to civil penalties of up to $11,000 and up to a year in prison.

""If a live dolphin or whale strands in Texas, please DO NOT PUSH the animal back to sea, do not attempt to swim or interact with them, do not crowd them,"" the Texas Marine Mammal Stranding Network said.

Ultimately, a person at the beach called Quintana Beach County Park for assistance. The park called the incident a ""tragedy."""

UPDATE: Georgia school removes homework question: “There are more appropriate ways to teach this subject”

On Jan 19, 2022, Jennifer C. Martin, a senior contributor to Olney Magazine, shared a photograph on Twitter that displayed a question posed to fourth grade social studies students. Martin said the image is of an assignment given to a friend’s child.

Martin told Native Viewpoint via email that the school is Georgia Cyber Academy, an online charter school.

The assignment was titled: Writing Prompt, The Trail of Tears and proposed the following:

Write a letter to President Andrew Jackson from the perspective of an American settler. Explain why you think removing the Cherokee will help the United States grow and prosper.

After seeing the assignment, Martin tweeted, “(M)y friend’s kid’s school in Georgia sent homework with this question.”

After posting the image, Martin saw her post go viral. At the time of this writing, three days after the initial tweet, the post has over 4,100 retweets, 2,435 quote tweets and over 29,000 likes.

Martin says she posted the tweet in hopes of bringing awareness to the homework assignment meant for fourth graders. She also said her friend was shocked at the assignment.

“I think my friend shared it in our moms’ group because she was so shocked that she didn’t know how to answer and wanted advice as to what to do,” Martin wrote in the email.

“I shared it publicly because I wanted people to know this is going on in state-funded schools, and how dangerous the anti-CRT (critical race theory) rhetoric and laws are, and what kind of lies it leads to when discussing history. I’m also a parent, and I would be horrified to learn my kids were getting assignments like that.”

President Andrew Jackson’s legacy

President Andrew Jackson, a United States leader that owned approximately 150 slaves at the time of his death, was a key figure in the creation of the Indian Removal Act. In 1829, Jackson was inaugurated as the seventh president.

Within just a few weeks, Jackson set into motion the policies that saw the removal of Native people from Georgia, Alabama, North Carolina and Mississippi and included tribes such as the Cherokee, Choctaw, Seminole, Chickasaw and Creek.

In 1830, Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act, which gave the federal government power to begin the forcible relocation of thousands of Native people westward.

Jackon’s massive removal policies resulted in what Native people call the Trail of Tears. More than 15,000 Cherokees were forced to travel to present day Oklahoma on foot. Over 4,000 died on the journey.

The farms owned by Cherokee people — that were left behind — were taken by white settlers without compensation to the Cherokee.

Responses to the assignment on social media

Martin’s post on Twitter has received hundreds of responses to her post. Some responses are critical of the assignment, while others cite students are simply being asked to consider a settler’s point of view.

Dr. Twyla Baker, Mandan-Hidatsa who goes by @Indigenia on Twitter, was one of the first to call out the school’s posed assignment in a series of tweets.

Baker wrote, “What if the child being asked is Native? Being able to remove oneself from the harms that this question revisits on children/families; being able to view it just as a historical event and not something that happened to the very people one is descended from, is privilege.”

What if the child being asked, is Native?



Being able to remove oneself from the harms that this question revisits on children/families; being able to view it just as a historical event & not something that happened to the very people one is descended from – is privilege. — Dr. Twyla Baker (@Indigenia) January 20, 2022

One user, who identifies herself as an educator on Twitter, wrote, “This is the same type of question a child may be asked about the American Revolution. Asking why some colonists were loyal to the crown. Or asking why plantation owners thought slavery was OK. It’s not asking them to take that side, but to speak from the populace who were on it.”

One user responded to the educator with “it literally is asking them to take the American settlers side and come up with a rationalization for genocide.”

Baker told Native Viewpoint that there are ways to teach empathy, but this way was not the best approach.

“I think I can point to the entire tribal college movement as proof that there are myriad ways to teach history that doesn’t ask marginalized groups of students to “play Devil’s Advocate” or justify genocide on behalf of oppressors,” said Baker.

“There are better ways to teach history that respect the voices and perspectives of everyone involved, and include multiple narratives, because history belongs to all of us. We need to actively dismantle the idea that only one narrative exists. Many, many scholars are doing it in classrooms across the country; to do otherwise is intellectually lazy, and disrespects our children, no matter their background.”

Native Viewpoint has reached out to the school in hopes to learn further details such as the other questions on the homework assignment and context as to how the questions were asked. Updates and comments will be posted if and when they are received."
"Chinese man has been living at Beijing airport for 14 years because he doesn’t want to give up smoking, drinking",https://www.gulftoday.ae/lifestyle/2022/03/28/chinese-man-has-been-living-at-beijing-airport-for-14-years,nottheonion,"Wei Jianguo poses for a photograph at Beijing airport.

Gulf Today Report



Life with the family can be a bit tiring, and many may feel disturbed and trapped by constant family interference. But it seems that a Chinese man took it too seriously, deciding to leave his family and live inside the airport, in the similar manner the American actor Tom Hanks did in the movie “The Terminal.”



Wei Jianguo, a Chinese man in his 60s who was so disturbed by his family life, that the only solution in his view was to move to Beijing Capital International Airport, where he has lived for 14 years.



Unlike Tom Hanks' 2004 movie, The Terminal - where the tourist is forced to live at JFK - Mr. Wee has his food package, belongings and sleeping bag in a waiting area, and can leave the airport at any time, but he doesn't.



According to the Chinese newspaper, ""China Daily"", the Chinese man decided to take this step; so he can smoke and drink alcohol as much as he likes.



He said in previous statements to the newspaper in 2018, that he would not return home; because then he will have to give up alcohol and smoking, adding, “I can't go home because I have no freedom there.”



""My family told me that if I wanted to stay, I had to stop smoking and drinking,"" he said.



""If I couldn't do that, I had to give them all the monthly government allowance of 1,000 yuan (£119.43). But how can I buy cigarettes and alcohol?”



After disagreements with his family, he began sleeping in railway stations and the airport, before deciding to settle in the airport completely.



In 2008, he moved to the airport and settled in Terminal 2, which is about 12 miles from his home.

The man said he had given up looking for work and had been given a job in an internal combustion engine factory in his forties.""



One of the workers at the airport said Wei had been encouraged to leave several times, ""but he was refusing and losing his temper.""



According to the China Daily, Wei is not the only resident at the airport, and in 2018 as many as six people were believed to be living like him.



But the world's most famous airport resident remains. Iranian Mehran Karimi Nasseri lived in Charles de Gaulle's Terminal 1 for 18 years — from 1988 until 2006 when he was hospitalised.

Trail of candy wrappers leads Ga. deputies to 9 people accused of leading burglary ring,https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/coweta-county/candy-wrappers-trail-leads-ga-deputies-arrest-7-they-say-burglarized-multiple-homes/7X5VFUFXVRGY7KG2PAZSAJ6C5Q/,nottheonion,"NEWNAN, Ga. — A trail of discarded candy wrappers led to nine people being arrested by the Coweta County Sheriff’s Office for allegedly burglarizing homes in Newnan.

Deputies told Channel 2′s Bryan Mims that bag of Milky Way candy bars was critical to solving the case. They say the trail of wrappers led them right to a group of people they believe were responsible for several burglaries.

[DOWNLOAD: Free WSB-TV News app for alerts as news breaks]

The incidents occurred over the course of three days in early October.

One of the incidents occurred on Oct. 4, when deputies were called to a home on Thomas Way about a possible burglary.

Once deputies arrived, the victim stated that he left his home around 6 a.m., and when he returned at 2 p.m., he noticed his truck was moved into the garage.

When the victim went inside his home, he found a maroon Carhartt beanie on the kitchen counter that wasn’t his and noticed some of his items missing, the incident report stated. The victim also said that he noticed someone tried to pull his dining room A/C unit out.

A victim, who did not want to be identified, told Mims that he came home and “everything was basically turned upside down.”

He says the burglars made off with his clothes, four guns, ammo, a chainsaw, anxiety pills. They even stole the bag of Milky Ways from his refrigerator.

TRENDING STORIES:

“During our walk on trails through the woods, he was able to point out some of the wrappers. And when he found one wrapper, we were able to walk a little bit further and find another wrapper. And so on and so forth. And it just formed a trail, and it showed us exactly where the individuals had walked,” investigator Christian Spinks said.

The trail led them to the Shady Oaks Mobile Home Park where the suspects lived.

Investigators later learned that the suspects would allegedly use the woods as a shortcut to get to and from the homes.

Authorities said they would stash the stolen items in the woods and use leaves to cover them up.

The suspects also stole food, like orange juice, from several of the victims.

Coweta County Sheriff’s Office arrested Gerald Bennett, Ryan Murrow, Amber Brooks, Kevin Atkins, Alan Caswell, Brooke Fields and Tracy Hendrix.

Heard County Sheriff’s Office arrested Marvin Rachalla. One juvenile was also arrested.

Deputies in Heard County were able to recover one of the stolen guns and reached out to Coweta County, which was able to link Rachalla with the crime ring.

Deputies say the suspects are responsible for two separate homes being burglarized and five cars being broken into. This is an ongoing investigation with more crimes and arrests possible.

Coming into force on March 1st, the legislation is the product of years of lobbying from French environmental groups. The law requires the mention of one of three statements in any given advert. Roughly translated, these are ""For short journeys, walk or cycle,"" as well as ""think about carpooling"" and ""Take public transport daily.""

These messages must be included in all advertising, whether in print, online, or broadcast on radio or TV. The messages must be clearly visible on screen, or in the case of radio ads, be spoken aloud after the ad proper is finished. A hashtag, #SeDéplacerMoinsPolluer, is also required to be displayed in certain contexts, which translates to ""Move without pollution."" Fines for non-compliance can range up to €50,000.

It's part of a wider push to cut down on transport emissions in France, with private cars making up a full 15 percent of the country's greenhouse gas output. The country has already pledged to end the sale of gas and diesel-powered cars by 2040, while the city of Paris has banned older, more polluting vehicles from the city center.

Speaking on the legislation, the Minister for the Ecological Transition of France, Barbara Pompili, highlighted that a multi-pronged approach was required to clean up transport. ""Decarbonizing transport is not just switching to electric vehicles. It also means using, when possible, public transport or cycling,"" Pompili tweeted on Wednesday.

It's a change that won't directly cut carbon emissions by any means. However, it looks to serve as a way for the French government to push the message that automotive emissions are a negative thing that must be curtailed by multiple different means. Whether the push will see a change in French driving habits will remain to be seen,."

CROCKETT, Texas – A Texas woman is now out on bond after sheriff’s deputies said she tried to purchase another woman’s child while waiting in a checkout line at Walmart.

According to a report from KSAT’s sister station KPRC, Rebecca Taylor, 49, came up to the woman’s shopping cart in the checkout line. The woman’s cart had two children inside at the time.

Taylor started to make comments about one of the woman’s two children before allegedly asking if she could buy him for $250,000, KPRC reports.

The mother refused her offer and Taylor pressed further. She increased the offer to $500,000 and allegedly threatened to take the infant, according to the Harris County Sheriff’s Office.

Deputies said the mother still refused and was able to leave the store with her children safely. That’s when she notified authorities of what happened.

Taylor was arrested and charged with sale or purchase of a child, a third-degree felony in Texas.

Records show she was released Thursday on a $50,000 bond.

Netflix Removes LGBTQ Tag From ‘Dahmer’ After Backlash From Viewers: ‘Not The Representation We’re Looking For’,https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/dahmer-lgbtq-tag-netflix-removes-category-backlash-1235387213/,nottheonion,"Netflix has removed the LGBTQ tag from its Ryan Murphy-created Jeffrey Dahmer limited series, “Dahmer — Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story.” The show, starring Evan Peters as the notorious serial killer, launched Sept. 21 on the streaming platform and was categorized under the LGBTQ tag for at least two days. A source with knowledge of the situation confirmed to Variety the LGBTQ tag was officially removed by Friday, Sept. 23.

The decision to categorize “Dahmer” as LGBTQ content ignited controversy on social media, with many subscribers condemning Netflix for the decision (via the Los Angeles Times). The tag is normally used to spotlight shows such as “Heartstopper” and “Sex Education,” both of which include LGBTQ characters and subject matter in a positive light. “Dahmer” technically does feature an LGBTQ character since the serial killer was a gay man, but as one subscriber wrote on TikTok, “This is not the representation we’re looking for.”

“Netflix, I implore you to please reconsider having Dahmer with the LGBTQ tag, especially as one of its tags right when you open the app,” another subscriber wrote on Twitter.

All television series and films on Netflix are sorted into categories to help drive the streaming platform’s search algorithm. “Dahmer,” for instance, was initially categorized as “LGBTQ” in addition to “ominous,” “psychological,” “horror,” “vintage crime” and “dark.”

Since launching Sept. 21, “Dahmer” has been a ratings hit for Netflix with 196.2 million hours viewers in its first week. Reviews have been less kind. Variety television critic Caroline Framke panned the series for being “predictable,” adding, “It’s a grim, sepia-toned slog that rarely justifies its own existence.”

The tag removal is far from the only controversy that “Dahmer” has courted since its debut. Real-life family members of Dahmer’s victims have condemned the series, with Rita Isbell, the sister of Errol Lindsey, telling Insider, “It’s sad that they’re just making money off of this tragedy. That’s just greed.”

Netflix did not respond to Variety’s multiple requests for an official statement on the matter. “Dahmer — Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story” is now available to stream."
"Rich countries that let inequality run rampant make citizens unhappy, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2022/apr/17/rich-countries-that-let-inequality-run-rampant-make-citizens-unhappy,nottheonion,"Countries that allow economic inequality to increase as they grow richer make their citizens less happy, a new study shows.

Until now, researchers have believed that inequality was largely irrelevant to levels of life satisfaction, according to Dr David Bartram at the University of Leicester.

But his study of 78 countries spanning four decades – the largest longitudinal research of its kind – punctures that myth, he said.

“When inequality increases, people with high incomes don’t benefit much from their gains – many rich people are focused on those who have even more than they do, and they never feel they have enough,” Bartram said.

“But people who earn little really suffer from falling further behind – they feel excluded and frustrated by not being able to keep up even with people who receive average incomes.”

Bartram’s research, which is due to be presented at the British Sociological Association’s online annual conference on 21 April, examined survey data of life satisfaction levels, where people rate their life satisfaction on a scale of one to 10, and linked it to Gini coefficient numbers – a measure of inequality – from 1981 to 2020.

In 1981, as the UK was gripped by a recession, life satisfaction stood at 7.7. But during the economic boom of the 1980s, inequality grew, and the research shows that the happiness figure dropped to 7.4 by 1999.

However, as measures to reduce inequality began to take effect, happiness slowly returned so that by 2018, life satisfaction stood at 7.8.

“The data from the UK feeds into a more general finding – in wealthy countries increased inequality has a substantial negative impact on life satisfaction, and inequality has increased in most wealthy countries in recent decades,” Bartram said.

This link between higher inequality and lower life satisfaction is repeated elsewhere, Bartram said.

Any country that moved from the lowest quarter of countries in terms of inequality to the highest quarter saw a decrease in life satisfaction of about 0.4 on the 10-point scale, he found.

India’s life satisfaction declined from 6.7 in 1990 to 5.8 in 2006 as inequality rose. By 2012 it was still lower than in 1990, despite the country’s prolonged economic boom.

The US and Australia also both saw pronounced falls in life satisfaction, but those countries where inequality had fallen were generally happier, such as Poland, Peru, Mexico and Ukraine, before the Russian invasion.

The lesson for policymakers is that inequality matters, Bartram said.

“In some of the previous research, you see people saying ‘inequality isn’t that big a deal, so all efforts to address inequality are misguided because inequality is beneficial’.

“I think that’s misguided – inequality is generally damaging to people’s life satisfaction so we should pay attention to efforts to mitigate it,” he said."
"‘Too much mayo on a sandwich’: 1 dead, 1 in surgery after being shot by customer",https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/atlanta/too-much-mayo-sandwich-1-dead-1-surgery-after-being-shot-by-customer-apd-says/ERSZ6VTFOBDY5K7ELGH4IXU2WY/,nottheonion,"ATLANTA — Atlanta police are investigating a shooting that has left one woman dead and another in critical condition at a metro Atlanta Subway store.

The reason for the shooting? Too much mayonnaise on a sandwich, police said.

[DOWNLOAD: Free WSB-TV News app for alerts as news breaks]

APD responded to a Circle K gas station at the intersection of Northside and Markham St. to calls about a shooting just after 6:30 p.m. When they arrived, they learned two female employees had been shot after a dispute about the amount of mayonnaise on a customer’s Subway sandwich.

Police said the woman who was killed was 26 years old. A 24-year-old employee was shot in front of her 5-year-old son and is now in critical condition. A relative told Channel 2′s Tom Jones that the victim, Jada Statum, was hit twice after she pushed her son under the counter to keep him from being hurt.

A co-owner of the Subway said that a third worker shot at the gunman.

“He didn’t hit the guy, but he put up a little fight,” Willie Glenn said.

A 36-year-old man has since been arrested. Police have not identified him.

“There was something wrong with the sandwich that made him so upset that he decided to take his anger out on the two employees here,” police said.

Atlanta police officers said that this was a case of someone with a gun who didn’t know how to resolve conflict without resorting to violence.

Jones talked to Statum’s uncle, who said her son witnessed his mother get shot and that she is doing all right.

Glenn said it breaks his heart.

“It just breaks my heart, to know that someone has the audacity to point a weapon, and shoot someone for as little as too much mayonnaise on a sandwich,” said Glenn.

The store’s other co-owner, Al Bailey, said no one deserves to get shot over something so trivial.

“Everybody packing,” Bailey said. “What sense does it make? They want to dummy this society down.”

He wouldn’t release the identity of the worker who was killed because he’s still waiting for family members to be informed, but he said both employees were young women who had just started at the location about three weeks ago.

“They were just model employees,” Glenn said.

Glenn said the shooter had been in the store before.

Interim Chief Of Police Darin Schierbaum said arguments are the majority cause of homicides in 2022.

TRENDING STORIES:

“An argument leads to someone picking up a weapon and firing that gun, leaving someone dead or someone critically injured,” Schierbaum said.

Schierbaum feels that people should talk more and use guns less when it comes to handling disputes.

“We need individuals to talk out their disputes, walk away and do not pick up guns. We can take down drug operations that breed violent crime, we can dismantle gang organizations that breed violent crime, we can stop robbery crews that breed violent crime, we cannot stop someone who is mad because there is too much mayonnaise on their sandwich,” said Schierbaum.

Jake Paul is broke after 'putting all his money in crypto',https://www.joe.co.uk/entertainment/jake-paul-crypto-341900,nottheonion,"Jake Paul could be in trouble after the crypto crash

Jake Paul is apparently “poor” after he invested his money in cryptocurrency, according to his brother Logan.

In recent days, the crypto market has crashed, with the biggest currency Bitcoin falling by 25 percent in the last week and currently trading at its lowest value for 18 months.

This is after the currency had peaked at a high of almost $70,000 in November.

It is thought that because of the wider economic climate, investors are less keen to buy crypto and traders are selling up, the BBC reports.

This week, the largest global crypto exchange platform paused all Bitcoin withdrawals for a few hours, with crypto lender Celsius doing the same because of “extreme market conditions.”

And the Coinbase exchange has announced it is laying off 18 percent of its staff because of what it is calling the “crypto winter.”

It seems like Jake Paul may have found himself caught up in the crash as well, if his brother is to be believed.

Speaking on a recent episode of his podcast, Logan used finger quotes when talking about his brother’s “boxing career”. When it was suggested to him that Jake had had a successful career and made over $40m, Logan laughed and said: “It doesn’t matter, he put it all in crypto! He’s poor!”

If this is true, Logan wouldn’t be the first YouTuber to be burned by the volatile world of cryptocurrency. Earlier this year, KSI found himself on the wrong end of a crypto crash after investing “2.8 million” in the cryptocurrency LUNA, which then lost 97 percent of its value in just 24 hours.

Paul recently tweeted about the state of the economical climate in the US, blaming president Joe Biden for not doing anything about gas, inflation, and crypto prices.

Biden accomplishments 1. Highest gas prices

2. Worst inflation

3. Plummeting crypto prices

4. Highest rent prices ever

5. Created new incomprehensible language If you’re reading this and voted for Biden and you still don’t regret it then you are the American problem. — Jake Paul (@jakepaul) June 12, 2022

But the world of cryptocurrency is unregulated and is not under the control of any political administration in the world, so this really isn’t something any politician can be blamed for.

One of the main selling points of crypto is that it is not controlled by any government. If Jake is angry about losing his money, he only has one person to blame – himself.

United Airlines Flight Canceled After Taxiing for 8.5 Hours,https://aeroxplorer.com/articles/united-airlines-flight-canceled-after-taxiing-for-85-hours.php,nottheonion,"On August 22, 2022, at Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), a United Airlines Boeing 737-900ER taxied for 8.5 hours until the flight was cancelled—running out of fuel in the process. For more than eight hours the aircraft sat on the ramp awaiting its turn to depart. The flight, from Newark to Denver (DEN), was about to begin its journey when inclement weather—consisting of thunderstorms and lightning—caused delays. After three hours of waiting on the tarmac to take off, the aircraft returned to the gate for its first time. Passengers were supposedly told, “if you really need to go to the bathroom or stretch your legs, go ahead, but we really prefer you don’t, and we won’t hesitate to leave you behind.""





After the brief wait, the aircraft returned to the tarmac in a second attempt to take-off, which proved unsuccessful. For this second takeoff attempt, the aircraft waited on the tarmac for another three hours until it didn't have enough fuel to make it to Denver should it have taken off. This was due to a new flight plan to avoid weather given to the pilots by ATC and the exhaustive fuel burned while taxiing. As passengers stretched their legs during the second visit back to the gate they were notified via the United App that their flight had been canceled. Since the crew were unaware of this notification they decided to re-board the 737 and taxi.

Ultimately, after 2.5 more hours of taxiing—8.5 hours of taxiing in total—the on-board crew clocked out and the flight returned to the gate to be anulled. In addition to the extensive delay, it took another half hour to disembark the aircraft. Passengers were only given ""a cup of water and a tiny packet of those biscoff cookies"" during the entire 8.5 hour event. It was also reported that the pilots were ""out of apologies."" Hiroko Tabuchi, a New York Times Reporter who was on the flight, had this to say about the incident: ""You can’t make this up.. my United flight out of Newark taxied on the tarmac for more than 6 hours, and now **no longer has enough fuel** to get to Denver — so we are taxiing back to the terminal.""

The Federal Aviation Administration said the average delay time for all U.S. flights on that same Monday was 37 minutes, with 92% caused by weather, 5% due to volume, and 3% linked to staffing issues. While these events are destined to happen as part of the aviation industry, some airlines handle these situations differently and provide differing levels of quality in reimbursements."
Free noodles offered as Japan wrestles with low youth turnout for elections,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/06/free-noodles-offered-as-japan-wrestles-with-low-youth-turnout-for-elections,nottheonion,"A major Japanese ramen chain is offering free noodles to young people ahead of Sunday’s upper house elections, amid widespread concern that the nation’s disaffected youth will not bother turning out to vote.

Ippudo, which operates 50 ramen shops across the country, is offering endless free noodle refills for a fortnight from election day on Sunday until 24 July, the Mainichi Shimbun said, provided they could show proof that they had voted.

Younger Japanese routinely complain that politicians are more interested in appealing to the country’s huge bloc of older voters, and point to the low number of younger MPs in both houses of parliament.

“Politicians view elderly people, whose turnout is high, like important customers from whom they can win votes,” said Hiroshi Yoshida, a professor of the economics of ageing at Tohoku University. “On the other hand, young people are like occasional customers, so are less important …. so policies favoured by the elderly inevitably get prioritised.”

An Ippudo spokesperson told the newspaper it hoped their offer would “create an opportunity for people to cast their vote, even if voting hasn’t become a habit for them”.

Turnout among younger voters is consistently low, and few believe this weekend’s election will be an exception.

In last October’s elections for the more powerful lower house, just 36% of those in their 20s voted in single-seat constituencies – making them the least politically engaged group – according to the internal affairs ministry.

Those given the vote in 2016 were slightly more active, with 43.2% turning out to vote. The turnout among people in their 20s has remained below 50% for the past three decades, the ministry said.

With the current election campaign dominated by the cost of living crisis, disengaged young voters are harming their own financial futures, according to a new study.

They lose about ¥78,000 ($575) a year for every 1% drop in youth voter turnout, according to Hiroshi Yoshida, a professor of the economics of ageing at Tohoku University.

After analysing 40 years of election data, Yoshida concluded that the government is more likely to raise taxes and issue bonds, increasing the future debt burden on younger people, every time turnout among the latter group falls by 1%. In addition, pensions increase by more than benefits for younger people, such as childcare allowance, under the same circumstances, he said."
Minnesota congressional candidate proposed giving away most of his state to South Dakota,https://heartlandsignal.com/2022/03/14/minnesota-congressional-candidate-proposed-giving-away-most-of-his-state-to-south-dakota/,nottheonion,"A graphic of HF 2423's possible implementation. (Source: Jeremy Munson on Twitter)

Jeremy Munson, running for Minnesota’s 1st U.S. Congressional district, previously co-wrote a bill to allow most of the state to secede to South Dakota.

The Minnesota House of Representatives gave the bill, HF 2423, its first reading almost exactly a year ago. The bill would allow any county in the state to secede from Minnesota.

On March 25 of last year, the day the 23B district representative introduced HF 2423, Munson tweeted a link for a petition “to allow MN counties to join a State [sic] that respects Freedom and Liberty [sic].”

The link in his tweet is no longer functional. But in an archived snapshot, the petition notes, “State lines have been relocated many times throughout American history.” It claims the purpose of having individual state lines is to allow for “the opportunity for state governance to vary according to the culture of a local area.”

Munson’s tweet included an image showing almost the entire state joined with South Dakota; only a small sliver east of St. Paul would remain as Minnesota. The new South Dakota would also reach more north than current North Dakota does. Both South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem’s gubernatorial and personal accounts were tagged.

✔️ MN Voters allow Counties to leave

✔️Counties vote to join neighboring State

✔️ Congress approves pic.twitter.com/S8KwWRv1fA — Jeremy Munson (@jeremymunson) March 25, 2021

Noem appeared to endorse Munson’s plan, tweeting “In South Dakota, we roll out the red carpet for people who love personal responsibility and Freedom.”

HF 2423 requires an amendment the state constitution which lays out a process for any county to be excluded from the territory of Minnesota and be incorporated into a neighboring state.

First, the county board would have to pass a measure to leave Minnesota. County voters, during a state general election, would have to answer “yes” on the question of secession from Minnesota. Both votes must pass by a two-thirds majority. If it does, the issue would then go to the U.S. Congress.

If Congress approves, the state legislature would take up the issue. Upon passage by two-thirds of both chambers, state voters would get their say in the next state general election. The measure of secession would again have to pass by a two-thirds majority.

The Minnesota House has not taken any other action on HF 2423 since its first reading last year. Munson is running to occupy the seat recently vacated by Jim Hagedorn, who died of kidney cancer in February."

Florida arrested felons for election fraud. It also gave them voter IDs.,https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2022/08/31/florida-arrested-felons-for-election-fraud-it-also-gave-them-voter-ids/,nottheonion,"TALLAHASSEE — The state’s top election enforcement officials stood in a Broward County courtroom on Aug. 18 in front of a row of green-uniformed sheriff’s deputies to send the message: If you cast a vote in Florida and you’re not eligible to do it, “we’re coming,” Gov. Ron DeSantis said.

The governor announced that 20 individuals across the state were being arrested for voter fraud as part of a crackdown on felons disqualified from voting because of convictions for violent crimes and sexual assault, the governor said.

“They’re going to pay the price for it,” DeSantis promised.

The announcement grabbed national headlines, further fueling speculation that DeSantis will run for president in two years. Yet, two weeks after law enforcement orchestrated the round-up of arrests to coincide with his press conference, the case is starting to fall apart.

The first obstacle is the legal principle of intent. For the state to get a conviction for a third-degree felony for the crime of voting as an unqualified elector, it must prove that the people who voted illegally willfully intended to break the law.

Yet of those arrested so far, all told Florida investigators that they received a voter registration card from their county elections supervisor’s office and believed they were authorized to vote by someone in government. According to the charging documents, some were told they were authorized to vote by multiple government officials.

“The more that comes out on the arrests, the more I believe the individuals involved had no knowledge or intent to violate the law,” wrote Sen. Jeff Brandes, the Republican from St. Petersburg and Senate sponsor of a 2018 law that allowed some felons to vote, in a post on Twitter.

The more that comes out on the arrests the more I believe the individuals involved had no knowledge or intent to violate the law. https://t.co/u5qwUtcws0 — Jeff Brandes (@JeffreyBrandes) August 29, 2022

Because “the state has to prove intent,” he said he wonders: “Were these people ever notified that they were not eligible to vote? And can we prove that they did it willingly?”

Four of those arrested in Broward County told investigators they received voter registration cards authorizing them to vote from the Broward Supervisor of Elections office between 2019 and 2020. At the time, the office was headed by Pete Antonacci, the lawyer DeSantis appointed to head the Office of Elections Crimes and Security.

On Aug. 18, the day of the arrests, Antonacci sent a note to supervisors of elections across the state with lists of convicted felons the office suspected of voting illegally. He said that it was “through no fault of your own” that the individuals “were registered to vote and voted in your county.”

Laurel Lee, the former secretary of state appointed by DeSantis, and key legislators are on the record saying that it was the responsibility of the state, not the counties, to flag those who were ineligible to vote in 2020.

The 18 people arrested were registered to vote between late 2018 and 2020 during a period when the Department of State was struggling to weed out ineligible voters following the passage of 2018′s Amendment 4.

The amendment ended Florida’s lifetime ban on voting for felons but specifically excluded those who had been convicted of murder, sexual assault and criminal sexual behavior. The automatic restoration did not apply to people who had not completed “all terms” of their sentence, including probation or parole.

Republican legislative leaders, most of whom opposed the amendment, decided to implement a law clarifying that “all terms” included any court-ordered financial obligations, and they specified which crimes counted as murders and sex offenses.

State was understaffed

Under state law, it is the state’s responsibility to screen ineligible voters and inform county supervisors to remove those people from the rolls, then-Secretary of State Laurel Lee, a DeSantis appointee, told the Times/Herald and ProPublica in 2020.

But the state had no central database to check whether a felon owed fees, and by May 2020, the department had a backlog of 85,000 people it needed to verify and potentially remove, Division of Elections Director Maria Matthews told a federal judge that month. The backlog was almost hopelessly large, Matthews testified. She had 20 people capable of processing 57 applications a day, she said.

“We work through the files the best we can,” Matthews testified.

In the meantime, the state was not removing felons from the rolls who might owe fines and fees, Lee said.

Until local supervisors have removed those excluded from having their rights automatically restored, “they are eligible voters,” Lee told the Times/Herald in an interview on Oct. 5, 2020. “Those individuals are not being blocked from voting.”

In an email to the Times/Herald at the time, Lee said that it was the state’s job to verify the eligibility of felons and pass that information to county officials.

“The Florida Department of State has a duty under section 98.075(5), Fla. Stat. to identify those registered voters who have been convicted of a felony and whose voting rights have not been restored,” Lee wrote. “The law requires the department to review information from a number of sources and make an initial determination as to whether the information is credible and reliable.”

The state was, however, removing felons who were ineligible because they had murder convictions or sex offenses on their record. Lee said at the time that about 6,000 people had been removed from the rolls. But data at the time showed the state was struggling with the process.

The Times/Herald and ProPublica identified in October 2020 about 260 registered sex offenders and 1,200 felons on probation who were still on the voter rolls, even though they were ineligible.

The 18 felons targeted by DeSantis remained on the rolls for months after they voted in 2020. At least five of them from Hillsborough County, for example, were not removed from the rolls until this year, according to the county’s supervisor of elections.

Florida’s voter registration application asks applicants to check a box that reads: “I affirm that I am not a convicted felon, or if I am, my right to vote has been restored.”

During committee hearings, in discussions with supervisors of elections, and talks with the secretary of state’s office, legislators also concluded that determining which felons should be excluded from the voter rolls and which granted automatic restoration was the job of the state, not county officials, Brandes said.

“Supervisors just don’t have the capacity to do this, and only the state does,” he said.

To that end, the Legislature authorized $750,000 in 2019 for the secretary of state “to have the resources to thoroughly vet these things,” said Brandes, who was in charge of the Senate criminal justice budget at the time. “And if they needed more resources, they just simply needed to ask.”

Lee did ask for another $1 million in 2020, and the Legislature rejected it.

The voter arrests were the first project of the Office of Election Crimes and Security, proposed by the governor last fall as he attempted to quell calls from supporters of former President Donald Trump for the state to conduct an election audit to justify their baseless claims of voter fraud.

During the 2022 lawmaking session, Florida’s Republican-led Legislature created a slimmed-down version of the office and charged it “with investigating all election crimes in Florida.”

Conflicting messages

On Tuesday, DeSantis was asked at a news conference in Suwanee County, “What role does the state have in notifying elections supervisors about these ineligible voters?”

He didn’t answer the question but said the blame should fall on supervisors who allow ineligible voters to be added to the voter rolls. He didn’t mention that supervisors are required by law to pass along completed voter registration forms to the state for its approval.

“I think that there have been reports that supervisors have told voters, ‘Hey, if you’re a convicted murderer, you can go ahead and vote.’ That’s false. And that’s not following the law,” DeSantis replied. “... It’s really their responsibility to ensure that those voting rolls are accurate.”

Documents show that Florida Department of Law Enforcement agents knew that almost all of the people arrested Aug. 18 thought they had the right to vote in 2020 because they had received voter registration cards.

Romona Oliver, 55, was released from prison in 2019 after serving a 20-year sentence for second-degree murder. She told the Times/Herald she had heard about Amendment 4 while in prison, and didn’t realize that her offense was disqualifying.

She became a registered voter on Valentine’s Day 2020 when she registered at the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. She said she had mentioned that she had a felony but still received a voter card in the mail.

This spring, before her arrest earlier this month, she was removed from the Hillsborough County voter rolls.

“Why are we prosecuting people who made an honest mistake?” asked Mark Rankin, a Tampa-based attorney, representing Oliver for free. “If you’re a felon in Florida it would be very reasonable for you to believe that your rights were restored when the voters decided in 2018.”

Neil Volz, deputy director of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, said his organization is working to make sure that those arrested are released on bond and have access to pro bono legal counsel to fight the charges.

“There’s a different legal standard for removing somebody from the rolls and arresting them,” he said. “The bar to being arrested is wildly higher. It’s ‘beyond a reasonable doubt,’ and taking somebody’s liberty away really gets to the core of our democracy and how our systems work.”

‘Impact over intent’

Brandes predicts that many of the defense attorneys for those arrested will take some of the cases to trial, increasing the costs to the state.

“This is right now a million-dollar operation,” he said. “They’re going to find letters and they’re going to find video, and they’re going to find stuff that points to: We made a mistake.”

Whatever the outcomes, the announcement may have achieved the governor’s intended goal, Brandes said.

“It’s impact over intent,” he said.

“Do I think that anybody thinks it’s going to make a huge difference whether 20 people from around the state voted? No. But the impact was massive. And the impact for him both at the state level and the presidential level is probably going to be positive — which is what he wants.”

Stockholm — A Swedish zoo has been partially shut down after a king cobra staged an impressive escape from its enclosure at the weekend, with staff on Monday still searching for the venomous vagrant. The snake, named Sir Vas (Sir Hiss), escaped on Saturday through a lamp fixture in a terrarium and was believed to be somewhere in an inner ceiling.

He had only been brought to the zoo a few days earlier. The snake has now been renamed Houdini after the famed escape artist, said Jonas Wahlstrom, director of the Skansen Aquarium.

Staff have spread out flour to try and track the slithery fugitive and sticky traps have been deployed.

They have also brought in special cameras designed to inspect sewage pipes, in order to search the nooks and crannies out of reach.

The terrarium has housed king cobras for about 15 years, but it only took the new tenant a few days to find a way out, Wahlstrom told AFP.

""It turned out to be clever,"" he joked.

He explained that the escaped snake had an advantage over previous tenants: staff had recently replaced the lamp at the top of the enclosure with a low-energy bulb.

""The old light was so hot that no snake wanted to get close,"" Wahlstrom said. ""But now it's not hot at all and the new king cobra discovered this and wedged its head in between the lightbulb and the light fixture and managed to push itself out.""

A visitor managed to capture the escape on video, where a distressed person can be heard asking: ""Is it safe to be here?""

A staff member calmly replied: ""No, but we're working on it.""

The reptile section was subsequently evacuated and has been closed until the escaped cobra is captured.

Wahlstrom said there was no danger of it escaping outside.

""It won't get out, but hypothetically it's also so cold outside that it would doze off immediately,"" Wahlstrom said.

He also stressed that king cobras are typically quite calm and unlikely to attack.

King cobras, originally from South and Southeast Asia, are the world's longest venomous snake.

They mainly prey on other snakes but their bites can be fatal to humans if untreated."
Call to tighten New Zealand law that allows public pooing if no one watching,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/04/call-to-tighten-new-zealand-law-that-allows-public-pooping-if-no-one-watching,nottheonion,"A New Zealand law allowing people to poo in public – so long as they do not think they are being watched – must be tightened, says a freedom camping association, amid long-running allegations that campers are to blame for much of the human waste in the natural environment.

It is currently an offence to defecate or urinate in a public place (other than in a public lavatory), but, if the person can show they had reasonable grounds for believing they were not being observed, they may be able to escape a $200 fine.

The Responsible Campers Association Inc argues the law should also require people to show they conducted their business at least 50 metres from a waterway and the waste is buried to at least 15cm.

“It is not so much the action which creates concern, but the visible after-effects,” said Bob Osborne, the group’s spokesperson.

The group started in 2017 to advocate for freedom campers – people who stay free of charge on public lands – on the basis that the mode of camping should not be targeted, but rather individuals behaving badly.

Freedom camping has hit the country’s headlines in recent years over concerns about its impact on the environment, especially when it comes to campers’ personal waste.

Reports regularly crop up in local media linking freedom campers to increases in excrement and toilet paper littering popular tourist destinations, while some local councils have opted to ban the campers from hotspots altogether.

Frictions between campers, locals and the government peaked in late 2020, when tourism minister Stuart Nash told the national broadcaster, RNZ, that freedom campers in non self-contained vehicles “pull over to the side of the road and … shit in our waterways”.

But Osborne said it was unfair to blame freedom campers for the country’s public poo problems. “There is no evidence linking any specific group to this undesirable practice which affects travellers every day all over New Zealand,” he said.

The group believes minimising “the more undesirable aftermath” would be the most appropriate way of addressing the problem in the short term, but that more toilet facilities for travellers would be the best long-term solution.

Freedom camping reached its peak in 2019, just before the country snapped shut its borders to Covid-19. Government data recorded roughly 245,000 freedom campers that year, and of those, 91,000 were New Zealand residents.

In 2021, Nash announced the government would crack down on freedom camping, including harsher fines for those behaving badly, and tougher restrictions on where campers can park.

The rules are set to be introduced to parliament this year, in time for what could be the country’s busiest summer season in more than two years, with the borders fully reopening to tourists."

Central Florda jail to begin charging prisoners $5 per day: report,https://beacononlinenews.com/2022/02/16/going-to-jail-now-youll-pay-5-per-day-for-your-stay/,nottheonion,"Starting in the fall, Volusia County will treat its lockup like a hotel: Guests at the county jail will be charged for their lodging, food and laundry.

Following the lead of at least 50 other counties in Florida, Volusia will seek to recover some of the expenses of keeping people behind bars while they await trial or serve sentences.

“We’re feeding them every day. We’re taking care of them every day,” Dr. Mark Flowers, the county’s director of the Corrections Department, told the County Council Feb. 15.

Volusia County already bills inmates for medical-care copays. The new fees will likely affect a larger group of inmates.

Under Florida law, Flowers explained, counties may assess and collect fees for booking people into the jail and/or for their daily occupancy of a cell. The fees, he said, “may be withdrawn from an inmate’s cash fund.”

He gave an example: “If inmate Flowers gets money from his family, we would be able to go in and collect it.”

The County Council debated and subsequently opted to charge a $30 “booking fee,” for initial processing and admission to jail.

Flowers referred to the booking fee as a “one-time” charge, but the fee may be charged “one time” for each charge.

For example, if a suspect is arrested for shoplifting and brought to jail, the individual may be charged $30 for the entry and incarceration. If, after serving time for the charge, the person goes out and is arrested for allegedly burglarizing two homes, the individual may be held responsible for another $30 “one-time” booking charge on the new charges.

Also, for each day a person stays in jail — before being released on bond, or released by a judge — the arrestee may be billed a “subsistence fee” of $5.

Flowers noted that the state statute authorizing counties to charge the jail fees does not define “subsistence,” but he referred to it as “the cost associated with feeding, clothing and sanitary care of inmates.”

Flowers said the county pays an average of $3.09 per day to feed a prisoner.

Flowers conceded that the county will not recover the new fees from everyone held behind bars. He estimated the actual collection rate may be about 35 percent, based on the experience of other counties.

The Florida law that allows counties to bill inmates for their time in jail requires that the inmate’s “financial status” be taken into account “for the purpose of paying from their income and assets all or a fair portion of their daily subsistence costs.”

In addition, prisoners who work while in jail are exempt from the fees.

Some inmates are indigent and have nothing to pay. Others have sources of income, such as disability payments, that the county may not touch because such income is exempt under federal or state law.

A summary of the jail-fees issue given to the County Council mentions the possibility of non-collection.

“Debt for non-payment of the fees may accrue for up to three years, at which time it would be forgiven,” the memo reads.

There are many who can afford to pay for their upkeep, as County Council Member Ben Johnson — the county’s former sheriff — noted.

“Money is money,” Johnson said. “People in jail are getting coronavirus money. Am I correct?”

“You’re correct,” Flowers replied.

Flowers later told The Beacon he knows of inmates who received the federal stimulus checks mailed to taxpayers in 2020 and 2021. The county, he said, may and should go after those payouts to recoup the costs of keeping the recipients locked up.

Statistics compiled by the county’s Corrections Department show there were 18,936 inmate admissions during the 2020-21 fiscal year. Based on that number, at the projected 35-percent collection rate, the $30 booking fee would yield approximately $195,000 annually.

Based on the 578,312 inmate-bed days logged by the Corrections Department during the same period, by assessing a $5 daily subsistence fee, the county could reap $1.01 million per year, according to the data presented to the council.

The average daily count of prisoners in the jail is about 1,460, Flowers said.

The council voted 6-1 in favor of charging the jail fees. Council Member Barb Girtman dissented. She favored a subsistence fee of $1.50 per day.

Flowers addressed the lone dissenter to the measure, arguing the higher fee was necessary.

“I’m going to be honest with you, Miss Girtman,” Flowers said. “There are a few that are indigent, but they don’t hesitate to get their honey bun funds from their mamas and their grandmas and their five and six girlfriends.”

The jail fees go into effect Oct. 1. County Attorney Mike Dyer said the decision to impose the charges is an administrative action, so an ordinance is not required.

On a related note, the County Council, upon Flowers’ recommendation, also agreed to implement a counterclaim provision in state law. That would allow the county to seek payments of $50 per day from inmates who win lawsuits filed during the time the inmates were in jail, to offset some of the expenses of keeping them locked up.

The county is now the target of more than a dozen lawsuits filed by current and former inmates. Flowers highlighted one civil action from an inmate who is suing because the jail serves honey buns, and the sweet treats are making him fat.

The county’s Corrections Department has a budget for the 2021-22 fiscal year totaling $61.8 million. The agency has 356 full-time employees."
Taylor Swift clarifies she wasn't even on most of those 170+ trips her private jet took this year,https://www.avclub.com/taylor-swift-private-jet-170-flights-statement-co2-1849352396,nottheonion,"It’s often hard to quantify the excesses of the rich and powerful. Sure, we can clock the total cost of a red carpet outfit, do some napkin math to figure out how much a big gala must have cost, or watch the super-mansion price listings like very jealous hawks. But for most of the things that separate the Famouses from us N ormals, it’s very hard to get any kind of itemized listing of all the ways they’re just plain better than us mere mortals.

The exception to that rule, typically, is private jet use, on account of flight records being public knowledge that has to be logged with various airports —hence a whole little cottage industry of blogs and accounts that keep an eye on the flight times of the hoi polloi. A nd, now, a new Rolling Stone piece laying out some of the biggest private jet users in the world (and their subsequent carbon emissions) , with Taylor Swift topping the list with 170 flights taken by her private jet this year so far, and counting.

Presumably r ealizing that the optics on this aren’t great—private jet flights are harder on the environment than almost any other action an individual can take (while still being a tiny fraction of the emissions put out by the fossil fuel industry, natch)—Swift’s team quickly issued a statement to Rolling Stone, clarifying that Swift isn’t even on most of those flights. Being a generous soul, she loans her jet out liberally, apparently, so she’s not the one taking the flights. (It’s…still her plane, though? We’re not actually sure how this statement helps, if we’re being honest. )

None of which has stopped a healthy crop of mocking jokes about Swift’s plane usage from popping up all over the place online today, in a very “My statement about how I don’t actually take a lot of private jet flights has a lot of people making fun of my private jet use” sort of way. (Many GIFs of random people riding in helicopters are involved.)

In addition to Swift, other folks named in the list (assembled by sustainability marketing company Yard, working with data scraped from Celebrity Jets ) include professional athletes Floyd Mayweather (177 flights) and Alex Rodriguez (106 flights), as well as Jay-Z, who gets credited with all the flights taken by Puma’s private jet, because the brand apparently bought the plane at his suggestion. Others on the Top 10 of flight takers include Steven Spielberg, Blake Shelton, Oprah Winfrey, Kim Kardashian, Mark Wahlberg, and Travis Scott, all of whom reportedly thus have carbon emissions footprints several hundred times higher than the average American’s."
"""Libraries Are Promoting an Agenda to Destroy Families"": Idaho State Rep Partners on Program to Remove Books from Libraries",https://bookriot.com/heather-scott-book-ban-plans/,nottheonion,"Comparing the current climate around book bannings to 9/11, Idaho State Representative Heather Scott introduced a workshop called “How to remove inappropriate materials from our schools/libraries” co-sponsored with Amy Henry, founder of Parents for Freedom and Liberty. The event, advertised through the official Idaho state legislature dispatch, called it a a way to learn what to do about “smut in our Idaho libraries.”

The full event can be viewed here.

In her opening remarks, Scott called for people to band together like they did in post-9/11 America in order to take back libraries. “The war is also demonstrated by non-gendered bathrooms, drag queen storytime, use of hormone blockers, and boys with ear piercings and painted fingernails,” she said, mentioning that after abortion, the rise of “smut in the library” was the most disturbing thing she’s seen in eight years as a legislator.

Henry, a former public school math teacher in the Treasure Valley, explained that everything happening right now is indoctrination. Everything stems from social emotional learning (SEL), critical race theory (CRT), and equity diversity and inclusion (EDI). Henry links the $440 million dollars Idaho received in the first round of emergency relief funding during COVID to requirements for schools to implement SEL and DEI initiatives.

She goes on to further claim both the National Education Association and the Idaho Educational Association teacher unions are pressuring educators to follow these agendas, which encourage bullying and revoke the right for individuals to think for themselves.

All day kindergarten, she believes, is a plot for the government to begin indoctrinating children as young as 5 years old.

As outrageous as these statements sound, these are the talking points being made by book banners across the country. Thanks to propaganda through films, through conservative news, and social media groups spearheaded by groups like Moms for Liberty and similar (such as Henry’s own Parents for Freedom and Liberty), censors believe that public schools–what they call government schools, both a nod to Trump’s language about educational institutions and to the history of the real brutal government schools throughout the US and Canada–are indoctrinating children. That indoctrination begins with a foundation in marxism and includes SEL, CRT, and DEI, in addition to comprehensive sex education.

Their current target of ire is the CDC’s “Whole School, Whole Community, Whole Child” model. They believe the CDC is encouraging schools to teach children about difference in gender and race to bring in more money for its own programs and purposes. School counselors are encouraging young people to change genders and undergo hormone therapy, and that groups like the CDC are funding this initiative. Scott points out that all-day kindergarten is a convenient way to push such indoctrination and that federal funding for after school programs furthers that agenda. She believes that what began as STEM programming evolved into STEAM programming so that Art could create an umbrella category to include equity clubs, including LGBTQ groups.

Scott continued the discussion with reminding attendees about an incident in Coeur d’Alene, mentioning that the person who shot a reverend there had been practicing mindfulness. Mindfulness, she says, is part of SEL.

Earlier this year, Idaho’s House Bill 666 went to the senate, where no action has been taken, as senators saw it as “mischief.” The bill, sponsored by Representative Gayann DeMordaunt (R), claimed it was a necessary way to protect the state’s children from what she claims are obscene and pornographic books in libraries across the state. Scott noted that the Idaho Public Library association, who opposed the bill, wrote a letter explaining that HB 666 would put librarians at legal risk and at risk for steep financial penalties, something she claims proves that they have something to hide.

She went on to highlight how the American Library Association (ALA) is further encouraging this indoctrination, citing a story about a librarian in southern Idaho who attended the recent Public Library Association conference in Portland, Oregon, this spring but was afraid to attend the current event because of how it might make her look professionally.

“Idaho libraries play to be members of PLA and ALA or ILA, and they are entitled to legal representation as a result,” said Scott of what that librarian told her. “One of the main goals is to queer the library (the new president of ALA is a Marxist lesbian). They advise us to remove gendered bathrooms. One speaker said that when a book is challenged you should complicate the conversation and obfuscate to confuse the person challenging the books. They encourage diversity audits and with a goal to have 50% of our materials diverse/LGBTQ. They systematically weed libraries of normative content. They encouraged self-criticism and told us to out other employees at work.”

Scott then stated bluntly that it was time to pull Idaho libraries out of the ALA. This would require electing a superintendent of education willing to do just that.

Here’s a snapshot of Scott’s proposed actions for organizing and removing books across the state:

Find a person in your county to take the lead

Form a group of concerned citizens that meet regularly

Identify every library in your county including school libraries and find out how they are funded. Many are funded through taxing districts. Find out if the Trustees are elected or appointed. Elected officials are far more trustworthy than bureaucrats. Request a line item budget from the county clerk to find out where money is coming from and where it is going. Look at the library’s memberships in organizations like ALA.

Follow your library’s events – many events are coordinated statewide and nationally. This includes displays. Libraries get a list of displays to do each month from ALA and that way they don’t have to think about their own displays and do their job. Ask if you can put up the displays in the windows instead.

Attend library board meetings

Run for office

Talk to the head librarian and look at the books. Coeur d’Alene group identified 150 books and they started checking them out to keep them out of the hands of kids (an audience member interjected that they have found out that having the books checked out means they are popular and the library will order more so they are rethinking that strategy). You must challenge the books. Figure out the rules of doing a challenge.

Determine when story reading times are and ask who reads and how they pick the books. Have your church volunteer to do the readings.

Read SMUT aloud in board meetings.

Go after their bonds – Bonds for the Win in Idaho – will help you do this

Elections matter so be sure to vote for those who support your values

Harris weighed in too, offering the following suggestions:

You have to identify the books in your library that are objectionable

Laverna in the Library is a group out of Utah that has started lists of bad books that you can start with

You can look for books in your area through GoFollett or using your library catalog

Most librarians are liberal so don’t expect any empathy from them

Libraries and museums can do pretty much whatever they want, they are choosing to have the books there because of a nationwide agenda

We are asking libraries to put identification stickers on books but honestly it’s not enough – the books just need to be removed

A note about in loco parentis – libraries and schools believe this means that when a child steps through their doors, they have control of the child

Don’t sign school handbooks, especially electronically – they will change the handbooks after you have signed. Always ask for a hard copy

Public schools are government schools with a government agenda. It is child abuse to have your children in these schools

It comes as little surprise to see the last point, especially as much of the push for book bans has an end goal of dismantling public education. Parents are encouraged to pull their kids from public schools and enroll them in either homeschools or private, right-wing funded institutions.

“This is a fight to change our culture, to give Satan control of our children,” said Scott in her closing remarks. She encouraged attendees to go to her website and explore the “smut” currently available in libraries. “We are at war.”

Whether you’re in Idaho or not, it’s vital to understand that the fight for the freedom to read and access books is not happening in a vacuum. This is one branch of a big tree growing under the work of dark money and dark politics, particularly those on the far right. In this instance, a state representative is encouraging citizens to disregard the First Amendment and doing so not only with her professional credentials behind her, but through the state’s legislative communication itself. She’s working on a singular agenda, rooted in Christian fundamentalism, and she’s firing up supporters in state and beyond to forge ahead on what they believe is a necessary crusade.

It is impossible to overstate that this is not about the books. The books are one of the tools right now, but this has been bubbling for nearly a decade. Unfortunately, as more educators and library workers call it quits for a variety of reasons, including poor pay, unsatisfactory work conditions, and harassment, these groups will succeed in their big campaign of killing public eduction.

Educators and librarians in Idaho and across the country need to amp up their efforts to push back. This will require updating policies about book challenges, speaking up and out to the media about what’s happening, and finding local supporters to help amplify the mission of these public institutions: to serve an entire community.

Crowded Maryland restaurant stays open after customer dies in the restroom,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/crowded-maryland-restaurant-stays-open-customer-dies-restroom-rcna52317?,nottheonion,"A crowded restaurant in Prince George’s County, Maryland stayed open and continued to serve patrons after a customer attending a family reunion planning session died in the women’s bathroom Wednesday.

A family was dining at Jasper's Restaurant in the town of Upper Marlboro and had just paid the bill when one of them went to the restroom, one of the owners, Fred Rosenthal, told NBC News.

""She went to the women's room and when members of the family got up to leave and she hadn't come back, they went to check on her,"" Rosenthal said. ""Someone found her unconscious, notified our employees and we jumped into the scene and called 911. Police arrived within minutes.""

Jasper's Restaurant in Upper Marlboro, Md. Google Maps

Officers with the Prince George's County Police Department responded to a crowded Jasper's Restaurant at 9640 Lottsford Court at approximately 6:40p.m. Wednesday evening to investigate, spokesperson Brian Fischer said.

Jasper's didn't close when the situation unfolded and continued to seat customers. A curtain barrier was put up around the women's restroom where the family gathered, and the men's restroom was converted into a unisex restroom.

""Hindsight is 20/20, we didn’t know it was going to take the coroner two hours to collect the body,"" said Rosenthal on the decision to leave the restaurant open. ""If we did, we would’ve stopped seating people. We were trying to keep it as respectful as possible and not cause a scene.""

The coroner's office arrived to the restaurant to remove the body at around 9 p.m., over two hours after police responded to the location, according to Rosenthal. The body was taken out of a side entrance so as not to disturb other diners. Jasper's stayed open until midnight Wednesday, continuing to seat diners until then.

The woman died of natural causes, according to the Maryland Office of the Chief Medical Examiner.

Rosenthal has since met with members of the woman's family.

""They came in to celebrate and plan a family reunion and it ended in a terrible event,"" he said."
"Wife filled husband’s phone with child porn in attempt to get custody of children, Oklahoma police say",https://www.pennlive.com/crime/2022/05/wife-filled-husbands-phone-with-child-porn-in-attempt-to-get-custody-of-children-oklahoma-police-say.html?outputType=amp,nottheonion,"Police allege an Oklahoma woman hatched a scheme to get custody of her children that centered around loading hundreds of images of child pornography onto her husband’s phone and then having him arrested.

Lacey Hucks, 33, the wife, and Angel Moore, 44, her friend, are alleged to have worked together to frame Hucks’ husband, who was not named.

“If they could get him out of the picture, then she thought she would get her children back,” Garvin County Sheriff Jim Mullett said according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.

Police say that Hucks drove Moore to the Wynnewood Police Department on April 18 and had her turn the phone in and file a report. They say that Moore turned in the device and said she saw Hucks’ husband using it to view child porn in their home.

The police say that phone had hundreds of images of “various juvenile victims.”

Police did arrest the husband, but they began to wonder why the phone he was using did not have any images similar to the ones Moore turned into them. That’s when they reportedly got a warrant to search Lacey Hucks’ phone and that reportedly showed that she and Moore were friends and had discussed carrying out the incident in advance.

And then Moore allegedly caved.

Police say that after she initially said she didn’t know Hucks, she told them that they were friends and that Hucks had coached her on what to do in advance of turning the phone in. She then, reportedly, admitted that she never saw the husband with the phone.

The husband told Police he had not seen his old phone since last “October or November,” but “didn’t think too much of it because it was not his primary phone and did not have service.”

Moore is facing charges of conspiracy and knowingly reporting a false crime, the Star-Telegram reported, and Hucks is facing the same charges as well as a charge of aggravated possession of child pornography."
Pearson plans to sell its textbooks as NFTs,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/02/pearson-plans-to-sell-its-textbooks-as-nfts,nottheonion,"Textbook publisher Pearson plans to profit from secondhand sales by turning its titles into non-fungible tokens (NFTs), its chief executive has said.

Educational books are often sold more than once, since students sell study resources they no longer require. Publishers have not previously been able to make any money from secondhand sales, but the rise of digital textbooks has created an opportunity for companies to benefit.

NFTs confer ownership of a unique digital item by recording it on a decentralised digital register known as a blockchain. Typically these items are images or videos, but the technology allows for just about anything to be sold and owned in this way.

After the release of Pearson’s interim results, CEO Andy Bird explained his plan to sell digital textbooks as NFTs, allowing the publisher to track the ownership of a book even when it changes hands, Bloomberg reported. “In the analogue world, a Pearson textbook was resold up to seven times, and we would only participate in the first sale,” he said, explaining that “technology like blockchain and NFTs allows us to participate in every sale of that particular item as it goes through its life”.

Bird, former chairman of Walt Disney International, joined Pearson in 2020, before which the company had been struggling with the growing costs of producing university textbooks, and the fact that many students opt to buy such books secondhand. This new plan is the latest development of his bid to move the publisher in a digital direction. It follows the launch of the subscription app, Pearson+ last year, which gives students access to 1,500 titles for $14.99 a month.

Selling books as NFTs is not an enitrely new concept, although it has yet to take off in the same way that the visual art NFT market has. NFT technology is largely being used in books as a way for authors to self-publish. And while digital distributors such as Germany’s Bookwire have launched NFT marketplaces, as the author and performer Walker Caplan noted in LitHub last year, much of the publishing world does not yet feel the need to engage with this new technology. This is because readers tend to place more value on having read a book than having owned it. Even if traditional publishers do enter this space, they “may not be met with open arms”, Caplan wrote, “as decentralisation is the central ethos of NFT writing.”

If Pearson’s use of NFTs proves successful, however, this method of selling digital copies of books could become more commonplace among mainstream publishing houses. And Bird is already exploring how other new technologies might be used by the company: he has a “whole team” working on “the implications of the metaverse and what that could mean for us”, he said."

A woman has married her pet cat in a bid to stop future landlords from separating them. Deborah Hodge, 49, claims she has previously been forced to rehome three animals by landlords who did not allow pets in their properties.

Now facing eviction and terrified of losing five-year-old India, Deborah, from Sidcup, south east London, held a civil ceremony on April 19 to tie the knot. The single mother-of-two hopes her commitment will show future landlords just how important it is for her that they stay together.

She said: ""I had nothing to lose and everything to gain so I married my cat! I recited vows under the universe that no man will ever tear myself and India apart.

""I set out my intention that I would never be separated from the animal I adore. I can't be without India.

""She is truly a sensation, she is so friendly and amazing. She is fundamentally the most important thing in my life after my children.

""By marrying India, I need any future landlords to know that we come as a package and we cannot be separated under any circumstances as she is as important to me as the children.

""I refuse to be parted with her. I'd rather live on the streets than be without her.""

While living in a previous property, Deborah claims she was forced to give up her two huskies, Siri and Starshine, after her landlord threatened her with eviction if she kept them. She said she was also left with no choice but to pass on her cat, Jamal, when she moved into her current home five years ago.

She said: ""It absolutely broke my heart. Your pets become part of your family and it was just absolutely devastating having to say goodbye to them.""

Desperately missing her pets, Deborah successfully begged her landlord to allow her to get another cat in 2017. Black and white moggy India joined Deborah and her two children and quickly became a key member of the family. India lost a leg in 2020 when she was hit by a car, meaning she can now often be seen perched on Deborah's shoulder or carried in her arms during trips to the beach.

Deborah lost her job as a life coach in March and now fears she could be evicted if she cannot meet her next rent payment, due May 1. Facing the prospect of trying to find a new home, she decided to marry India in the hopes it would show future landlords that the pair cannot be separated.

Deborah wore a tuxedo while India donned a bow tie, cape and gold lamé for their civil ceremony, which was officiated by a legally ordained friend. The newlyweds celebrated with their wedding guests by having a picnic in the sunshine.

Deborah said: ""I'm on my last pennies, I have nothing to lose and everything to gain, so I married my cat!

""I'm terrified of losing India. I can barely leave my house with anxiety over what the future holds and I'm just desperate not to lose my cat.""

She added: ""Although some might think it a stupid idea, I wanted to be able to show physically, by holding the ceremony in front of my friends even though they thought I was bonkers, that I am very serious.

""I had a group of friends there for the ceremony – they all think I've gone batsh*t crazy but we all had a lovely day. My kids weren't there on the day, they just think that mummy has lost the plot!

""I recited vows under the universe that no man will ever tear myself and India apart. I set out my intention that I would never be separated from the animal I adore."""

Today’s intended Wordle solution pushed to 2027 due to “major recent news event”,https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/05/todays-intended-wordle-solution-pushed-to-2027-due-to-major-recent-news-event/,nottheonion,"The New York Times has altered the Wordle solutions list to avoid an answer for today's puzzle that would have ""seem[ed] closely connected to a major recent news event,"" as the company put it in a public note this morning.

Today's originally intended solution, FETUS, was first added to the game's word list last year, when Wordle creator Josh Wardle included it among the randomly ordered list of roughly 2,300 five-letter words intended to define the daily word game for years to come. The New York Times has pushed that term to the end of the game's solutions list, where it is now scheduled to appear sometime in late 2027 (it remains to be seen if today's news focus on the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision will still be as much of a concern by then).

Copies of the Wordle webpage on the Internet Archive show the Times making the change for today's puzzle sometime on May 6. As such, players who have not refreshed the Wordle webpage in the last few days ""may see an outdated answer that seems closely connected to a major recent news event,"" as the Times wrote.

Players who don't refresh will also remain out of sync with others playing the updated version of the game. The Times wrote that it has ""continued to discover challenges"" following its seven-figure acquisition of the game in January. ""We’re now busy revamping Wordle’s technology so that everyone always receives the same word.""

A sensitive subject

Calling the original placement of FETUS ""unintentional"" and a ""coincidence,"" the Times wrote that ""we take our role seriously as a place to entertain and escape, and we want Wordle to remain distinct from the news. But because of the current Wordle technology, it can be difficult to change words that have already been loaded into the game. When we discovered last week that this particular word would be featured today, we switched it for as many solvers as possible.""

Last week's edits to the word list, which are viewable by looking at the game's Javascript source code, also pushed a handful of other words—BUTCH, STALK, FLACK, WIDOW, and AUGUR—to the end of the solutions list.

In February, the Times removed seven then-upcoming Wordle solutions (and 25 options for valid guesses) from the game's rotation, mostly to remove gendered or racial slurs from consideration. In late March, the company also pushed another 18 solutions to the back of the line, including VOMIT, FANNY, ECLAT, and FELLA.

In a recent earnings call, the Times said Wordle, which remains free, brought in ""tens of millions"" of new players to the site's Games section and ""played an outsized role in the quarter's engagement and subscriber growth."""

"Black Woman Wins Casino Jackpot, Files Lawsuit After Detroit Bank Refused To Deposit Check",https://www.blackenterprise.com/black-detroit-woman-wins-casino-jackpot-files-lawsuit-after-bank-wont-deposit-check/,nottheonion,"A retired schoolteacher in Detroit has filed a federal lawsuit after bank employees refused to deposit a check with the money she won from a casino jackpot.

Deadline Detroit reports Lizzie Pugh, 71, won the jackpot at the Soaring Eagle Casino & Resort in Mt. Pleasant, Michigan. However, when she took the check to a Fifth Third Bank in Livonia, employees told her the check was fraudulent, refused to give it back, and, according to Pugh, were blatantly racist.

“I couldn’t really believe they did that to me,” Pugh told The Detroit Free Press. “I was devastated. I kept asking, ‘How do you know the check is not real?’ … And they just insisted that it was fraudulent. … I was just terrified.”

The bank returned the check to Pugh and when she deposited it at a Chase bank branch, the check cleared with no issue, according to the suit, which was filed last week.

“To think that maybe they would have police coming and running at me — it was humiliating and stressful,” Pugh, who taught in Detroit for 35 years added. “For someone to just accuse you of stealing? I’m 71 years old. Why would I steal a check and try to cash it? I just didn’t think anybody would do that.”

On April 9, Pugh traveled to the casino with her church group and hit the jackpot on a slot machine. She chose to pay the taxes on the jackpot at the casino and took most of the winnings in a check and a small amount of cash.

Two days later, Pugh tried to deposit the check at a Fifth Third Bank. A bank employee called Pugh into her office where the retired teacher explained she wanted to open an account and handed the employee the check.

The check contained Soaring Eagle’s logo and Pugh’s address, which was the same as the one on her driver’s license. The employee left the room and returned, telling Pugh the check was a fake. Two more bank employees eventually entered the discussion and also stated they weren’t giving the check back.

Pugh refused to leave the bank and even threatened to call Detroit police before the bank’s employees gave the check back. All three bank employees were white.

Pugh’s niece, Yolanda McGee was the one who convinced Pugh to take legal action. The teacher didn’t want to press the issue, but McGee insisted and found Attorney Deborah Gordon, who has handled cases like this before.

“This is just extremely disheartening,” Gordon told The Free Press. “It’s really unfortunate these stereotypes continue to exist right here in our metro area.”"

Tesla No Longer Includes Charging Equipment With Vehicles,https://insideevs.com/news/580350/tesla-no-longer-includes-mobile-charger/,nottheonion,"In a surprising move, Tesla has suddenly discontinued its longstanding practice of including charging equipment with its vehicles. Tesla CEO Elon Musk replied to comments on Twitter about the new policy by saying ""Usage statistics were super low, so seemed wasteful"".

Every electric vehicle produced up until 2022 has included as standard equipment some sort of charging equipment. In the early days of EVs, most vehicles came with a simple 120-v portable charging cord. More recently though, many manufacturers are including dual-voltage portable charging equipment that allows the user to toggle between 120-volt and 240-v charging by switching an adapter on the unit.

However, the Kia EV6 that was just recently launched does not come with any charging equipment either, making it the first EV sold in North America that didn't come with any form of charging equipment.

Tesla has always provided a dual-voltage mobile connector, and as they are in many ways, has been a leader in providing exceptional portable charging equipment as standard equipment with all of its vehicles.

However, that practice is over. Tesla no longer includes charging equipment with its cars. New owners will need to purchase charging equipment before they take delivery of their vehicle or they won't have a way to charge it when they get it home. They could, of course, use Tesla Superchargers, but one of the best aspects of electric vehicles is the ability to plug in at home and charge the car up overnight while you're sleeping.

Quite often, first-time EV buyers will use the 120-v charging cord when they first take delivery of their EV until they figure out what equipment they want to buy and install in their garage. Since the 120-v charging equipment can plug into a simple household outlet, the owners have a way to charge their EVs right from day one, albeit in a slow way.

That's because while charging on a 120-v source, the vehicles will only replenish about 3-5 miles of range for every hour of charging. But that will work for most people in the short term until they decide on a permanent solution.

Many Tesla owners chose to install a NEMA 14-50 outlet and use the Mobile connector with the NEMA 14-50 adapter for all of their daily charging needs. They did, however, need to purchase the NEMA 14-50 adapter from the Tesla website for $35.00. Tesla used to include the NEMA 14-50 adapter with the mobile connector but discontinued that practice in 2019. Since then, only the 120-v NEMA 5-15 adapter came standard with eh mobile connector.

Besides using the portable charging equipment for daily charging, many EV owners like to have some kind of portable EVSE in the vehicle at all times just in case they find themselves in need of a boost somewhere. Even if they never use it (which is most likely what Elon was referring to when he said usage statistics were very low) having it there just in case provided peace of mind for many.

In concert with discontinuing the practice of including the mobile connector with its vehicles, Tesla now offers two versions of the unit. Customers can purchase a 120-v version with a NEMA 5-15 plug for $275.00, or a higher-powered 240-v unit with NEMA 14-50 plug for $400.

Both versions of the Tesla Mobile Connector are out of stock

Can't even currently buy one

But here's the kicker: Both units are currently out of stock. Therefore, you cannot even buy one now if you're about to take delivery of your new Tesla. We're also not sure if customers that ordered their Tesla's when the policy was to include the mobile connector with the vehicle, will still receive it when their order is filled. We'd love to ask the automaker for clarification, but Tesla doesn't respond to questions from journalists. Therefore, we're left to speculate.

I've started a poll on my Twitter account for Tesla owners to chime in on whether or not they currently use their Mobile Connector:

The fact that these units are out of stock leads us to assume Tesla is experiencing supply chain issues regarding parts for the mobile connector. That may have actually been the impetus behind the decision to discontinue including it with the vehicle. Perhaps Tesla simply cannot keep up with the supply and decided it would be easier (and cost-effective at the same time) to just drop it from the standard equipment.

Whatever the reason, could this be a sign of things to come for the entire industry? We mentioned earlier that Kia isn't including charging equipment with the EV6. Maybe that's going to be the trend moving forward.

We do believe that there will come a time when it won't be necessary to include charging equipment with every vehicle, perhaps once the majority of the population is on their 2nd or 3rd EV. But that's probably more than a decade away. For now, we believe it's still good policy to supply new owners with a way to recharge their vehicles on day one of ownership, without requiring them to have purchased and installed charging equipment beforehand.

UPDATE 4/17/22: Last night Musk tweeted that, based on feedback, Tesla will reduce the price of the mobile connector to $200. We checked the Tesla website and the price was still listed as $275.00. However, it is Easter Sunday today, so we wouldn't expect the new price to be updated until tomorrow anyway. He also recommended installing a Tesla Wall Connector before customers take delivery."
ERCOT CEO says he did not expect it to be as hot as it is,https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/texas/ercot-ceo-texas-record-heat/285-0ff58602-9491-4cc2-a8ed-74e3559e3f03,nottheonion,"ERCOT Interim CEO Brad Jones says he is concerned about some of the state's older power generators keeping up with the record demand for power this summer.

Example video title will go here for this video

HOUSTON — People who have lived in Houston for a while expect hot summers, but this one has been next level.

Now, the head of ERCOT has admitted to a Houston newspaper they did not expect it to be as hot as it is.

Look at later on Wednesday, the blue dotted line that represents demand is neck and neck – even passes – the purple supply line between 1:30 and 11 p.m.

It’s been like this all week.

In that interview, ERCOT Interim CEO Brad Jones says he is concerned about some of the state's older power generators keeping up with the record demand for power this summer.

Jones said the extreme heat scenario for this summer estimated that demand could reach above 81,000 megawatts, which was the original forecast for Monday. Originally, forecasters gave that a 5 percent chance of happening, according to Jones.

""The 81,500 (megawatts) was the extreme, but those numbers are in the system. We just start with what we think the expected case is, and in early May, the expected case was 77,500"" megawatts, he said.

But he’s hopeful that they’ll be able to keep everyone’s lights on.

So far, there haven’t been significant outages. ERCOT says one reason is because requests for people to conserve energy have worked.

KHOU 11 News has received several questions from viewers asking if big companies that use the most power are required to conserve energy when there’s a threat of outages in the state.

The answer is no. It’s optional for businesses just like the rest of us.

ERCOT says it hopes big businesses comply with requests.

As of this morning, the grid operator has not called for anyone to conserve energy the rest of the week."

Exclusive: Boston Dynamics pledges not to weaponize its robots,https://www.axios.com/2022/10/06/boston-dynamics-pledges-weaponize-robots,nottheonion,"Several robotics companies, including Boston Dynamics, are pledging not to support the weaponization of their products and are calling for others in the industry to do the same, according to a letter shared first with Axios.

Why it matters: Robots, like drones before them, have a wide range of peaceful and even life-saving uses, but can be turned into war-fighting machines, too.

Details: The open letter highlights the erosion of consumer trust in robots as among the reasons not to allow them to be used as weapons.

""We believe that adding weapons to robots that are remotely or autonomously operated, widely available to the public, and capable of navigating to previously inaccessible locations where people live and work, raises new risks of harm and serious ethical issues,"" the companies said in the letter.

The companies pledged not to add weapons technology themselves or to support others doing so. And ""when possible"" they said they will review customers' plans in hopes of avoiding those who would turn the robots into weapons, in addition to exploring technical features that could prevent such use.

In addition to Boston Dynamics, five other firms signed on to the commitment: Agility Robotics, ANYbotics, Clearpath Robotics, Open Robotics and Unitree Robotics.

What they're saying: Boston Dynamics CEO Robert Playter said, in an e-mailed statement: ""We are concerned about recent increases in makeshift efforts by individuals attempting to weaponize commercially available robots... For this technology to be broadly accepted throughout society, the public needs to know they can trust it. And that means we need policy that prohibits bad actors from misusing it.""

Go deeper: Here's the full text of the letter:

An Open Letter to the Robotics Industry and our Communities,

General Purpose Robots Should Not Be Weaponized

We are some of the world’s leading companies dedicated to introducing new generations of advanced mobile robotics to society. These new generations of robots are more accessible, easier to operate, more autonomous, affordable, and adaptable than previous generations, and capable of navigating into locations previously inaccessible to automated or remotely-controlled technologies. We believe that advanced mobile robots will provide great benefit to society as co-workers in industry and companions in our homes.

As with any new technology offering new capabilities, the emergence of advanced mobile robots offers the possibility of misuse. Untrustworthy people could use them to invade civil rights or to threaten, harm, or intimidate others. One area of particular concern is weaponization. We believe that adding weapons to robots that are remotely or autonomously operated, widely available to the public, and capable of navigating to previously inaccessible locations where people live and work, raises new risks of harm and serious ethical issues. Weaponized applications of these newly-capable robots will also harm public trust in the technology in ways that damage the tremendous benefits they will bring to society. For these reasons, we do not support the weaponization of our advanced-mobility general-purpose robots. For those of us who have spoken on this issue in the past, and those engaging for the first time, we now feel renewed urgency in light of the increasing public concern in recent months caused by a small number of people who have visibly publicized their makeshift efforts to weaponize commercially available robots.

We pledge that we will not weaponize our advanced-mobility general-purpose robots or the software we develop that enables advanced robotics and we will not support others to do so. When possible, we will carefully review our customers’ intended applications to avoid potential weaponization. We also pledge to explore the development of technological features that could mitigate or reduce these risks. To be clear, we are not taking issue with existing technologies that nations and their government agencies use to defend themselves and uphold their laws.

We understand that our commitment alone is not enough to fully address these risks, and therefore we call on policymakers to work with us to promote safe use of these robots and to prohibit their misuse. We also call on every organization, developer, researcher, and user in the robotics community to make similar pledges not to build, authorize, support, or enable the attachment of weaponry to such robots. We are convinced that the benefits for humanity of these technologies strongly outweigh the risk of misuse, and we are excited about a bright future in which humans and robots work side by side to tackle some of the world’s challenges.

Signed,

Cynthia Perkins: Teacher who fed students cupcakes laced with husband's sperm gets 41 years in jail,https://meaww.com/teacher-41-years-in-jail-disgusting-sex-crimes-sperm-laced-cakes-to-kids,nottheonion,"LIVINGSTON PARISH, LOUISIANA: A Louisiana teacher has been given 41 years of jail time after she pleaded guilty to several child sex crimes, including feeding cupcakes to students laced with her husband’s sperm. Cynthia Perkins was arrested along with her husband Dennis in October 2019 and slapped with 150 felony charges, including rape, child pornography, sexual battery of a child, and video voyeurism.



However, on Monday, February 14, the 36-year-old woman took a plea deal in exchange for testifying against her now former husband, who was a Livingston parish sheriff's deputy when taken into custody. Cynthia had initially maintained her innocence against 72 charges for multiple sex crimes. However, she later confessed to making child pornography, second-degree rape, and mingling harmful substances, which reportedly refers to an incident in which she mixed Dennis' sperm to “season” pastries and gave them to Westside Junior High School students.

Assistant Louisiana Attorney General Barry Milligan said on Monday, “These three (charges), we thought, were representative of what she had done and, by agreeing to the facts as we put them out on the record, she prepared herself to testify against Dennis Perkins.”



Reportedly, at the time of the ex-pair’s arrest, charges relating to a dog were also pressed against them. Following the arrest, Cynthia filed for divorce and also gave up her role as a teacher. She accused Dennis of manipulating her to carry out the crimes. Her attorney, Paul ‘Woody’ Scott, noted: “He is the real monster. That’s what she wants to make clear, it’s not about shifting blame, she took responsibility today, I mean, that’s what she did, but she looks forward to going after the real monster.”



Initially, Cynthia could have faced around seven decades behind bars. However, after she took the plea deal, several of the charges against her were dropped. She has now been awarded 40 years for second-degree rape and 30 years concurrent for sex crimes involving a juvenile under 13, in addition to a one-year term for the cupcakes incident.



Attorney General Jeff Landry said: “Today, Cynthia Perkins admitted to her crimes and pleaded guilty in court. She not only waived any right to appeal, and attempt to avoid conviction, but she also spared the victims from reliving her horrific crimes during this particular trial. Today’s conviction is in the best interest of our victims and justice. I wish to thank Assistant Attorney General Barry Milligan and Assistant Attorney General Erica McLellan for their work in obtaining this guilty plea, and we look forward to holding Dennis Perkins accountable for his crimes in the very near future.”

Assistant Louisiana Attorney General Erica McLellan spoke about how the victims’ families reacted to the deal. McLellan said, “They feel that this serves justice and better protects their children. She played a role in this and she acknowledged that today, but she was very much taken under the control of Denny Perkins, and he manipulated her and twisted her into doing a lot of things that she was not comfortable doing.”



Meanwhile, it has been reported that Dennis would face trial in May."
Ozzy Osbourne says he's leaving the US because of gun violence,https://abc7.com/ozzy-osbourne-sharon-buckinghamshire-leaving-california/12178377/,nottheonion,"Ozzy Osbourne is a Brit by birth and a Californian by choice. But after spending 20 years in Los Angeles, he's ready to leave the U.S., citing gun violence as a reason. ""I'm fed up with people getting killed every day.""

Ozzy Osbourne is a Brit by birth and a Californian by choice, but after spending decades in the Golden State, he's ready to leave the U.S.

Osbourne and his wife Sharon are returning to their Buckinghamshire residence after spending more than 20 years living in Los Angeles, the Black Sabbath singer told the Observer in a wide-ranging interview. Osbourne's family life in California was famously documented on the MTV reality series ""The Osbournes"" in the early 2000s.

Gun violence in the U.S. is part of what convinced him to return to the U.K. full-time, he told the Observer.

""I'm fed up with people getting killed every day,"" he said of American gun violence. ""God knows how many people have been shot in school shootings. And there was that mass shooting in Vegas at that concert ... it's f*****g crazy.""

He also noted that he didn't want to die in the U.S. ""I'm English. I want to be back.""

There have been more than 440 mass shootings in the U.S. in 2022, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which updated its data on Monday. The mass shooting in Las Vegas Osbourne referred to occurred in 2017 and killed 58 people, and it remains the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history.

Sharon Osbourne said ""America has changed so drastically"" and said there's ""nothing united about it."" She waded into divisive debates last year, when she defended her friend Piers Morgan in an argument with Sheri Underwood on an episode of their daytime series ""The Talk,"" and she later left the show after former colleagues accused her of using racist and homophobic language.

Ozzy Osbourne gave a different reason for wanting to leave to the Mirror earlier this year: In March, the U.K. tabloid reported that Osbourne said ""the tax is getting too much"" and that while he'd miss Los Angeles, he didn't want to continue paying current taxes to stay in the U.S.

The Osbournes will return to the U.K. in February, the Observer reported, where Osbourne said he will continue to make music. His new solo album, which he recorded while experiencing several chronic health issues including Parkinson's disease, will be released next month.

At least not if the latest report is true. Because, if it is, well … nobody plans for this. Because, the report says the truckers are apparently jammed up in traffic to the point that they are actually peeing on themselves “while circling the Beltway,” because they don’t have anywhere else to go. And that apparently has them ticked off to the point that they are laying blame on Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser and the police there and are contemplating attempting “making citizen’s arrests of Bowser and police officers in response.”

According to co-organizer and trucker Ron Coleman, The People's Convoy has a new goal: conduct ""citizen's arrests"" of Metro PD officers and DC Mayor Muriel Bowser. ""We have to put a summons out to the Metro PD and Mayor Bowser...we would do citizen's arrests [of] them."" — Zachary Petrizzo (@ZTPetrizzo) March 22, 2022

That probably would not be a good idea.

Add in the idea that the convoy began as a protest to COVID-19 restrictions, with many states relaxing those before the folks ever got to the Beltway to drive around and circles and reportedly urinate on themselves, and it sounds, literally, like a mess.

The convoy has been in Washington, D.C. now for more than two weeks, and there have been some interesting developments during that time. A week ago, a bicyclist appeared to hop in front of the convoy and bring it to a slow crawl. Convoy drivers have also reportedly complained about D.C. drivers flipping them off on the highway.

At some point, you have to figure, they might want to go home and go to the bathroom. But, maybe not, because, according to reports the group has raised more than $2 million in donations to support their efforts."

A police officer who touched his colleague's penis and shouted 'it’s a small one' has been sacked. PC Adam Reed was dismissed by Wiltshire Police for his 'wholly inappropriate' behaviour.

He was sacked following a five day misconduct hearing headed by an independent lawyer, a Legally Qualified Chair (LQC), Wales Online reports. During the hearing, Reed admitted that at a police station, in front of colleagues, he had pulled down the officer’s trouser zip, inserted his hand and touched his penis before shouting 'it's a small one'.

He claimed the incident was 'banter', and that he shouldn't be sacked. Reed argued it amounted to misconduct rather than gross misconduct, which results in dismissal.

But it was ruled that Reed’s behaviour was gross misconduct. He will not be able to work as a police officer again, as he was placed on the national barred list.

The victim, named as officer X at the hearing, said he was left 'violated' by Reed's actions. He had only spoken to Reed occasionally before, and had never worked with him directly.

The incident only happened about a month after officer X started full time in October last year. Deputy Chief Constable Paul Mills, of Wiltshire Police, said: ""The actions of former Police Constable Adam Reed were not only wholly inappropriate, they violated the dignity of his colleague and, would have caused him significant distress.

""His actions amounted to unwanted sexual conduct and the LQC’s decision to dismiss Adam Reed from Wiltshire Police is completely endorsed by the Force. He will now be placed on the national barred list which will ensure he is not able to work in policing in the future.

""There is no place in Wiltshire Police for anyone who conducts themselves in this way and, further to becoming aware of this incident, the officer was immediately suspended from the organisation. The actions of this individual will undoubtedly cause public concern and likely undermine the work of the exceptionally committed members of our organisation who strive to provide an outstanding service to the communities they serve.""

The book was already publicly available via Google Photos prior to the auction, allowing anyone access to it, the Financial Times reported.

And, as many replies to the DAOs tweet pointed out, owning a physical copy of a book doesn't give you the legal right to adapt and capitalise on the intellectual property.

""You bought a collectible for 100X estimated value. Do you think if you bought a Spider-Man comic you could start making Spider-Man movies as well?"" one wrote.

""I guess this is the natural result of NFT culture. You bought a scarcity-limited copy of a thing, and now you think you 'own' the thing,"" another tweeted.

The massive purchase price and reality of what they can and can't do with the book has left some members of the DAO wondering what they'd spent all the money on and pondering what they can do with it.

The current most popular proposal is to create an NFT of every page of the book, with a potential to then burn the actual book once that's done.

According to the proposer the book would then cross ""the boundary of physical to digital"", which would enhance the value of the NFTs.

However, with a digital copy of the book freely available, it remains to be seen how many people will willingly pay for a NFT of a single page when they can save every page for free.

"Thousands left stranded amid flight cancellations this weekend, including Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/flight-cancellations-transportation-secretary-buttigieg/,nottheonion,"At least 14,000 domestic flights were canceled or delayed in the United States this holiday weekend, leaving thousands of passengers stranded in part because of staffing issues for airlines in the air and on the ground.

More than 900 flights were canceled on Sunday alone. Delta was among the airlines with the most cancellations, with at least 200 flights grounded.

""A variety of factors continue to impact our operations, including challenges with air traffic control, weather and unscheduled absences in some work groups. Canceling a flight is always our last resort, and we sincerely apologize to our customers for the inconvenience to their travel plans,"" a Delta airline spokesperson said in a statement.

Since the start of June, U.S. airports have seen an average of 2.2 million passengers every day.

Amid the cancellations, Department of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg met with airline executives on Friday.

Buttigieg is advising airlines to meet their flight schedules and hire more customer-service workers. He said that if they do not meet these requirements by the Fourth of July weekend, the department could enforce fines on the airlines.

The day after he met with airline leaders, his own flight was canceled. Buttigieg was forced to drive from Washington D.C. to New York.

CBS News senior travel adviser Peter Greenberg said that airlines need to hire more in all departments to avoid more cancellations.

""You can hire as many customer service agents. You want to say, 'I'm sorry' but if you don't fix the root problems, the apologies will continue,"" he told CBS News' Elise Preston. ""You gotta be able to find pilots. There's a shortage. You have to be able to find people who work under the wing — ground handlers, baggage loaders.""

Travel experts recommend travelers book the first flight out to avoid cancellations. Due to the increase in summer travel, the Transportation Security Administration recommends that travelers arrive at least three hours before departure."

Netflix cancels shows following huge drop in share value and subscribers,https://www.techradar.com/news/netflix-cancels-multiple-shows-amid-huge-subscriber-loss,nottheonion,"Netflix is cancelling multiple shows and movies after its recent subscriber and financial problems.

According to The Wrap (opens in new tab), the streaming giant has pulled the plug on numerous in-development Netflix shows. The company's animation department has been hit hardest by the issues currently plaguing Netflix, which has suffered downturns in its market value and subscriber base since the turn of the year.

On Friday, April 21, we reported on Netflix's announcement that it had lost 200,000 subscribers since the beginning of 2022. The streaming company's recent decision to pull out of Russia over the war in Ukraine cost it 700,000 viewers (per Reuters (opens in new tab)), although that loss was offset by the acquisition of 500,000 new subscribers since the start of 2022.

Even so, Netflix's recent subscriber drop-off is its largest for a decade, and the streaming company estimates that it'll lose another two million paying customers before June 2022 – news which led to the company's market value plummeting by $50 billion (per BBC (opens in new tab)). The company's 9.8% year-on-year growth, according to its Q1 2022 shareholders' letter (opens in new tab), is Netflix's slowest quarterly growth since Q1 2021, too. Although, Netflix has noticed a gradual downturn in its financial expansion over the past 12 months.

As it reckons with its first loss of subscribers in over a decade, plus a huge slump in the valuation of its shares, Netflix has seemingly moved to proactively combat further financial instability. And that means cancelling multiple, in-development projects.

Hit Netflix shows like Stranger Things are safe from being cancelled. (Image credit: Netflix)

Per The Wrap's report, Netflix's Director of Creative Leadership and Development for Original Animation – Phil Rynda – was let go, alongside many of his staff, earlier this week.

According to Bloomberg (opens in new tab), Netflix is also in the midst of restructuring its engineering department to create senior and junior roles for its employees. Given the internal upheaval, Bloomberg also claims that former and current Netflix employees believe that the streamer could lose some of the best creative influences on its staff – a talent drain that would surely impact development on its most popular shows and movies.

Not only that, but the streaming giant also cancelled many in-house animated projects, including an adaptation of Roald Dahl's The Twits. A highly-anticipated animated series based on Jeff Smith's beloved comic book series Bone, plus Lauren Faust's Toil and Trouble, were other productions unceremoniously dumped by the streamer. Since news of Bone's cancellation broke, Smith has taken to Twitter (opens in new tab) to voice (and illustrate) his thoughts on the comic series' latest adaptation setback.

But it isn't just keenly-awaited Netflix series that have been dispensed with. Netflix movies including Bright 2, a sequel to the Will Smith-starring fantasy flick, have also been dropped by the streaming company, according to What's on Netflix (opens in new tab). Bright 2's cancellation is likely to have closer ties to 2022's Oscars slapgate incident, which saw Smith physically assault Chris Rock live on stage. We had previously reported that Netflix and Sony had pulled back on in-development Will Smith projects in the wake of the incident. But, according to Bloomberg reporter Lucas Shaw (opens in new tab), Netflix claimed that Bright 2's cancellation had little to do with Smith's Oscars confrontation.

It's unclear how many Netflix TV series and films are similarly set for the chopping block. However, it seems that some of the streamer's biggest hits – Stranger Things, The Witcher, Arcane, and Squid Game to name just four – are all safe.

It appears that new, in-development movies and shows are at risk of falling by the wayside. But, as we've previously seen from Netflix, the streaming giant isn't averse to pulling the plug on fan-favorite productions if deemed necessary. We're looking at you, Archive 81 and The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance.

Netflix is yet to respond to our request for comment, but we'll update this story if we hear back at some point.

Analysis: rough times ahead for Netflix

These are trying times for the world's biggest streamer. (Image credit: Shutterstock / sitthiphong)

These are certainly trying times for Netflix. Sure, the streaming company is still the biggest service of its kind globally, but there's no denying that it's been rocked by recent subscriber losses and a sizeable hit to its market share.

Netflix is having to deal with increased competition from Disney Plus, Prime Video, and HBO Max. The streaming trio equally provide value for money and high-quality entertainment for viewers, so Netflix doesn't have complete control of the streaming market like it used to. Add in Apple TV Plus' growing influence in the streaming industry – its recent pipping of Netflix to a Best Picture Oscar award win is sure to have rankled with Netflix executives – and Netflix's dominion of the streaming market is lessening over time.

The spiraling cost of living in some countries, such as the UK, has had an adverse effect on Netflix's subscriber base, too. As food, fuel, and energy prices increase worldwide, households are having to make tough choices about what they spend their money on. If it's a decision between feeding your family/heating your home or continuing to pay for Netflix, there's no contest: Netflix will lose out every single time.

And then there's the company's decision to crack down on password sharing between households. Netflix recently announced that it would no longer turn a blind eye to subscribers freely sharing their account information with family or friends who live elsewhere. To prevent this, Netflix has started testing a new ""Add an Extra Member"" paid feature, whereby account holders can pay an additional $2.99 per month to allow people living at another address to use their account. Based on reactions from multiple Reddit users (opens in new tab) in recent days and weeks (opens in new tab), it's a move that's proving to be very unpopular (opens in new tab).

It remains to be seen whether Netflix can recover from these setbacks. Yes, the streamer's 220 million-strong global subscriber base means that it should be fine for now. Netflix, too, will hope that these issues are only temporary, and that the next big Netflix hit may entice users to return in the future and start paying for the privilege of watching its content again.

There's no denying, however, that Netflix is currently having to navigate choppy waters. According to Macquarie tech analyst Tim Nollen (per Yahoo Finance (opens in new tab)), Netflix's best days could even be behind it, with the streamer's share prices crashing by 40% in the wake of its Q1 2022 earnings report. Meanwhile, Mark Mahaney – Evercore ISI Senior Managing Director & Head of Internet Research – believes the company's belated decision to potentially introduce an ad-based subscription has additionally cost Netflix in the long run (per Yahoo Finance (opens in new tab)).

With Netflix suffering a sizable financial hit amid its subscriber base issues, its next steps could be crucial in determining whether it can win back viewers' support or if things will only get worse from this point on."
China Blames Mail From Canada For Omicron Case In Beijing: Report,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/china-blames-mail-from-canada-for-omicron-case-in-beijing-report-2713308,nottheonion,"The Beijing patient received an item of mail on January 11 delivered from Canada (Representational)

China on Monday blamed the lone Omicron case in Beijing to an international mail delivered from Canada to Beijing via the US and Hong Kong, as the Chinese capital was on alert ahead of next month's Winter Olympics.

The single Omicron case detected in Beijing was traced back to an international document from Canada, and it was found to have similar strains from those in North America and Singapore, official media in Beijing reported.

The detection ahead of February 4 Beijing Winter Olympics sent officials on a leather hunt to prevent it from spreading. Few days ago, the Omicron variant was found in the nearby Tianjin city.

The Beijing patient received an item of mail on January 11 delivered from Canada via the United States and Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region, Pang Xinghuo, deputy director of the Beijing centre for disease control and prevention, said at a press conference.

The patient said that she touched the outside of the package and the first page of the document inside, Pang said.

Officials collected 22 environmental samples from the piece of international mail, and the nucleic acid tests all came back positive, she said.

The patient had no travel history in other provinces or cities within 14 days before the onset of symptoms, nor did she have contact with risk groups.

So far, the results of nucleic acid tests of 69 close contacts and more than 810 environmental samples have come back negative except for those collected from her home and workplace, Pang said.

Eight people that were in connection with the mail were tracked. Their nucleic acid testing results were negative, the official said.

China, where coronavirus first surfaced in Wuhan in December 2019, sought to blame it on cold chain logistics bringing seafood from abroad, deflecting allegations that it has emerged from local seafood markets or escaped from Wuhan Institute of Virology.

China's National Health Commission on Monday reported 243 COVID-19 cases in various cities including 3,494 patients still receiving treatment, of whom 15 were in severe condition.

So far 4,636 have died as a result of the virus in China since 2019, the Commission said.

"Wagner Group recruits large number of prisoners with HIV and hepatitis, marking them with wristbands",https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2022/10/25/7373389/,nottheonion,"STANISLAV POHORILOV — TUESDAY, 25 OCTOBER 2022, 11:34

The Russian private military company Wagner has started to recruit large numbers of prisoners who are suffering from serious infectious diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C for the war in Ukraine. The phenomenon has already become widespread.

Source: press service of Ukraine’s Defence Intelligence

Details: The fact that more than a hundred prisoners with confirmed HIV or hepatitis C have been recruited at Penal Colony No. 5 in Metalostroy (Leningrad Oblast, Russia) alone shows that this phenomenon is widespread.

The Wagner Group command ""marks"" the infected soldiers by forcing prisoners to wear red wristbands if they are HIV-positive and white ones if they have hepatitis.

According to the intelligence, the fighters are becoming angry about this situation. Russian medics are known to routinely refuse to treat injured [soldiers] with hepatitis or HIV.

Several fighters with HIV or hepatitis are already in Ukrainian captivity and have confirmed the information about the mass recruitment of infected prisoners by Wagner.

Previously: In early September, a video was posted online showing the oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin, who is close to Vladimir Putin and founded the so-called Wagner Private Military Company, personally encouraging Russian prisoners to go to fight in Ukraine.

Four workers fired after thousands of Massachusetts drivers got licenses without road tests,https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/594547-four-workers-fired-after-thousands-of-massachusetts-drivers-got-licenses,nottheonion,"Four employees for the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles (RMV) were fired this week after it was discovered that nearly 2,100 drivers were given licenses without taking road tests.

Officials at the RMV confirmed the news to The Boston Globe on Wednesday, saying that the situation is currently under investigation.

“Upon discovering suspicious activity regarding the issuance of road tests in 2020, the Registry of Motor Vehicles launched an investigation and referred the issue to law enforcement,” RMV spokesperson Jacquelyn Goddard told the Globe. “The RMV has determined 2,100 drivers were granted licenses without taking a road test. All of the impacted individuals have been contacted and will be required to take and pass a road test within 10 days. The RMV has terminated four employees involved in this matter and will continue to work with law enforcement on their ongoing investigation.”

In 2020, investigations started after a RMV supervisor reported suspicious activity, a source told the Globe.

The RMV later determined that since around April of 2018, a total of about 2,100 drivers were given passing marks by two test instructors at the Brockton Customer Service Center for road tests they never actually completed. Both instructors, who were not named, and two service center employees were fired in connection to the scheme, the Globe reported.

Officials said the road tests will be free of charge for those affected, and those who fail their test will be reissued a learner’s permit and be offered a Massachusetts ID card, free of charge."
Mike Myers: Shrek Is a ‘Dramatic Role’ and ‘I’d Be Thrilled’ to Do One ‘Shrek’ Film a Year,https://variety.com/2022/film/news/mike-myers-shrek-5-dramatic-role-1235274640/,nottheonion,"Mike Myers wants more Shrek in his life. During a career-spanning video interview with GQ magazine, the iconic comedian said he’d be “thrilled” if he was able to do one “Shrek” movie a year. Variety reported in 2018 that Universal was tasking Illumination founder Chris Meledandri with overseeing a “Shrek” revival, but a new installment has yet to be officially announced.

“The Euro-centric form that is the fairytale is really about classicism,” Myers said. “When I was approached to do ‘Shrek’ I originally did it as a Canadian and then I re-recorded it as Scottish because that seemed to be the most working class [accent]. I also I love the Scottish people. I have Scottish ancestry. I’m mostly English but Liverpool is the pool of life between Scotland, England, and Ireland.”

Myers said that halfway through making the first “Shrek” movie he realized his eponymous ogre was “a dramatic role,” despite the film being an animated comedy.

“There’s an emotional center there,” Myers said. “You know the old joke: I wouldn’t want to be a member of a club that would have me as a member. I have always felt that way. The concept of going from a self-loathing ogre to a self-accepting ogre was meaningful to me. I love playing Shrek. If I had to do one ‘Shrek’ a year I’d be thrilled.”

The “Shrek” franchise released four feature films between 2001 and 2010. The original “Shrek” turned DreamWorks Animation into a powerhouse studio with its $487 million worldwide gross. The movie became the first Oscar winner in the animated feature category. “Shrek 2” grossed $928 million. Both films competed for the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival. While “Shrek the Third” and “Shrek Forever After” earned less acclaim than the first two movies, they still managed to gross $813 million and $752 million worldwide.

The “Shrek” universe is making a comeback to theaters later this year with the release of “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish.” Universal recently bumped the sequel’s release from September 23 to December 21."

Louisiana woman says her rapist was given custody of her child in ongoing court dispute,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/louisiana-woman-says-rapist-was-custody-child-ongoing-court-dispute-rcna34140,nottheonion,"A Louisiana woman said a court gave temporary custody of her daughter to the man who raped her when she was 16, a recent development in a yearslong legal battle that advocates say should never have happened.

Crysta Abelseth, 32, claims she was raped by John Barnes when she was under the age of consent in Louisiana, and he was 30. The assault resulted in Abelseth becoming pregnant with her now teenage daughter, she said.

Abseleth said Barnes, who has been confirmed through a paternity test to be the child’s biological father, was given sole custody of her daughter earlier this year amid a court battle that dates back to 2011. She was ordered to pay him child support, court records show.

Initially both had shared custody of the child, who is 15 years old today.

“It’s been consuming my life. It has just drained me emotionally, financially,” Abelseth said. “I’m just exhausted. My quality of life has been minimal, because of having to ‘co-parent’ with this man who raped me and having to see him and speak with him. Anytime she has an event, he’s there. It was very difficult.”

An attorney for Barnes did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Barnes, in an email, directed a reporter to court documents about the case. In court documents, Barnes has denied that he committed felony rape.

Abelseth told WBRZ, a local station in Baton Rouge that first reported her story, that Barnes raped her after offering to take her home following a night out with friends in 2005. She was under the legal age of consent in Louisiana, which is 17. She told the station that she let family and friends believe a boyfriend had impregnated her.

Abelseth said that she reported the rape to police in July 2015, after meeting with a trauma counselor who informed her that she was still within her right to pursue charges against Barnes. She said law enforcement has not acted on the complaint since.

On Thursday, the Tangipahoa Sheriff’s Office said in a statement to WBRZ that the initial complaint ""never made it through the proper channels within the department to be assigned for investigation. Therefore, our department absolutely dropped the ball, and we simply must own our mistake.”

“The Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff’s Office has reviewed and identified the breakdown in operations relating to the initial complaint filed by the complainant,” Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff Daniel Edwards said in the statement. “Since that time, enhancements to department procedures have been implemented and measures put in place to ensure reports from the public never go overlooked or mishandled. Especially those cases alleging criminal acts against our youth.”

The department also said Abelseth did not follow up on the matter until April of this year, which Abelseth denies.

“I was calling and leaving messages and wasn’t getting responses,” she said.

The case has now been turned over to the local district attorney’s office, the sheriff’s department said in the statement. No charges have been filed.

Neither the Tangipahoa Sheriff’s Office nor Scott Perrilloux, the district attorney for Louisiana’s 21st District, responded to multiple requests for comment on Abelseth’s case.

In court documents, Abelseth has alleged that Barnes has been physically, mentally and sexually abusive toward their child.

He has denied those allegations in court documents.

In awarding temporary custody to Barnes, Judge Jeffrey Cashe, who has handled the case, said in a court document released Wednesday that Abelseth failed to show in court, that her daughter had suffered “physical or sexual abuse by the father,” and that she had “consistently consented to shared custody since the onset of the case.”

The judge said Abelseth “never alleged any sexual abuse involving the father and the minor child” until Barnes complained in court about the daughter’s alleged cellphone use last year. The judge said there was evidence “supporting the need for immediate protection of the child” because Abelseth had failed to comply with a court order to allow Barnes to review the daughter’s cellphone contents.

Cashe said he found sufficient evidence to show the minor “would suffer certain harm” unless the court issued the temporary custody order. An employee in Cashe’s office declined to comment to WBRZ citing “judicial canons” that prevent the judge from discussing the case, the news outlet reported.

The case is scheduled for trial on July 15.

Sean Cassidy, an attorney and advocate with the Louisiana Foundation Against Sexual Assault, said the case should be moot because it is against Louisiana law for an abuser to have custody of a child that was the product of the abuse.

“This seems like it’s just ignoring a fundamental fact that would lead anybody to conclude rather quickly that in the very least a statutory rape occurred,” he said. “That should affect any conclusions in a custody matter. It should be the determinative factor to guide a custody determination.”

Instead, Cassidy said those facts seem to either not have been presented correctly or ignored in the case.

According to the court documents, “the court was aware of the age difference between the two when this child was conceived. He was 30 and she was 16. That’s pretty much all you need to know,” Cassidy said.

Louisiana law, he said, mandates that if a child is born of rape, the abuser “shall not have visitation or any form of contact, which obviously would include custody.”

Abelseth said she was initially unaware of her rights and believed she had to go along with the custody case, which “progressively got worse” over the years.

She said the fact that she was the victim of statutory rape had previously come up in the trial because of her age and Barnes’ age at the time she became pregnant.

Cassidy said the court could end up ruling in Abelseth’s favor after a full hearing, but “it’s baffling to me why it hasn’t happened already.”

Abelseth said she believes the court “completely dropped the ball and mishandled my case, and it’s been very unfair for me.”

“There should never have been any rights to the child in the first place. It should never have gotten this far,” Abelseth said."
Woman Tricked Into Thinking She Was DEA Trainee for a Year: Officials,https://www.insider.com/oregon-woman-tricked-dea-agent-training-into-cosplay-2022-2,nottheonion,"An Oregon man tricked a woman into thinking she was training to be a DEA agent for a year, officials say.

A woman in Oregon who believed that she was training to be a Drug Enforcement Administration agent realized she had been tricked for a year by a man pretending to be her supervisor, according to a criminal complaint seen by Insider.

Robert Edward Golden, 41, is accused by Portland officials of impersonating a DEA special agent, using false credentials to gain information from residents and installing red-and-blue emergency lighting in his car to navigate traffic.

He also kept a tactical vest affixed with ""DEA Police"" patches, two body-armor-plate carriers, handcuffs, badges, and an AR-15 style rifle which turned out to be a BB gun, an affidavit from a DEA special agent, Morgan T. Barr, said.

Authorities discovered and detained the pair on February 1, after a police sergeant noticed one of the vests in the open trunk of Golden's car and approached them.

The officer asked Golden if he was a sworn federal agent, and Golden said that he and his ""trainee"" were both ""Feds"" working in Portland. Golden then told the woman to show the officer her fake badge, according to the complaint.

The pair were transferred that night to DEA investigators, and Golden then admitted the credentials were fake, according to the affidavit. This time, he claimed he and the woman were ""into cosplay"" and had the equipment and badges because it provided them with ""protection,"" officials said.

Golden also said he had previously helped break up a fight by shouting, ""Police!"" and holding up his badge like an officer, per the document.

According to the affidavit, the unidentified ""trainee,"" who wasn't charged, told authorities that Golden had given her a DEA badge and photo ID and said she'd been in training for a year while attending school for criminal justice.

She said Golden had taken her on night surveillance ""ride-alongs."" She said he also took her practice shooting and often mentioned four other supposed DEA agents by name — ""agent Anderson, agent Luis, agent Garcia, and Ms. Bennett."" The DEA agent who filed the complaint said there weren't any agents on the force by those names and that the agency doesn't provide ""ride-alongs.""

The complaint did not mention Golden's possible motivation for tricking the woman into believing she was a DEA agent.

If found guilty, Golden faces up to three years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000, The Oregonian reported, citing Assistant US Attorney Greg Nyhus."

A judge in India said a man divorced his wife for cooking him instant noodles every day.

ML Raghunath, a principal district- and sessions-court judge, recounted the case on May 27 at a press conference at a court in Mysuru, a city in the southwestern region of India, The New Indian Express reported.

Raghunath told the outlet he was a district judge in Ballari when he attended to what he called the ""Maggi case."" He did not provide information on the date of the case or the names of the couple involved. Insider was not able to independently verify the case.

The man said his wife would buy packets of Maggi noodles, a brand of instant noodles, and serve them to him for breakfast, lunch, and dinner throughout their marriage, Raghunath said at the press conference, according to the news outlet.

Eventually, the couple divorced with mutual consent, the judge said. Under India's Special Marriage Act of 1954, divorce by mutual consent requires both parties to live separately for one year and agree to dissolve the marriage.

A 2018 study by the International Journal of Management, Technology, and Social Sciences found India recorded a divorce rate of 11%. The same study found the US recorded a 50% divorce rate.

While India's divorce rate is low, Raghunath said more married couples had been trying to call it quits in the past few years.

""Divorce cases are increasing drastically over the years,"" Raghunath said at the press conference, according to The New Indian Express. ""Couples have to stay together for at least a year before seeking divorce. If there was no such law, there would be divorce petitions filed directly from wedding halls.""

A 2018 study found that 40% of marriages in Mumbai and Delhi might end in divorce. This photo does not show the couple involved in the case. IndiaPix/IndiaPicture/Getty Images

The judge added that divorces were more prevalent in urban areas than in rural villages.

""In rural areas, village panchayats intervene and settle the problems. Women have no independence and their fear of society and family sentiments force them to cope with the situation. But in cities, women are educated and financially independent,"" he said at the press conference, according to The New Indian Express.

Shubhada Maitra, a professor at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences in Mumbai, told the Hindustan Times last year that increased expectations were one of the reasons for the increase in divorce cases in India. Women in India are becoming more career-oriented, but many men still expect their wives to fulfill traditional roles, Maitra said.

""So, women bear double brunt, by working as an earning member of the family and at the same time also taking care of the household chores,"" Maitra told the Hindustan Times."

Nun jailed after stealing $800k to fund gambling habit,https://www.rte.ie/news/world/2022/0208/1278438-nun-us-gambling/,nottheonion,"An 80-year-old nun who stole over $800,000 to bankroll a gambling habit and fund lavish holidays was jailed for a year in California.

Mary Margaret Kreuper swore to a life of poverty when she took her vows six decades ago.

But as principal of a Catholic elementary school near Los Angeles, she diverted $835,000 of school funds to pay for gambling jaunts in Las Vegas, a court heard.

She also used the money to take luxury trips to swanky resorts like Lake Tahoe, where well-heeled tourists gather to cruise in the summer and ski in the winter.

""I have sinned, I have broken the law, and I have no excuses,"" Kreuper told the court, according to The Los Angeles Times.

She said her crimes were ""a violation of my vows, the commandments, the law, and above all the sacred trust that so many had placed in me"".

Kreuper admitted wire fraud and money laundering during a hearing last year.

The court was told how money sent to the school to pay for tuition and charitable donations was instead funnelled into secret accounts that Kreuper controlled.

When an audit threatened to expose the scheme, Kreuper told employees to destroy incriminating documents, the court heard.

The Times reported that when she was initially confronted by the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, Kreuper argued that priests were better paid than nuns and that she thought she deserved a raise.

Kreuper's lawyer, Mark Byrne, asked that she be allowed to serve her time at the convent where she had been kept since her crimes were uncovered in 2018.

He said she was addicted to gambling.

""This is not an excuse for what she did,"" he said, according to the Times, ""this is merely an explanation.""

District Judge Otis D Wright II told Kreuper that he had wrestled with what to do with her, and acknowledged she had been a good teacher for many decades,

""But somewhere along the line, you just ran completely off the road, and I think you understand that. At least I hope you do,"" he said.

Kreuper was sentenced to 12 months and one day behind bars."
Broward man arrested for leaving dead animals at school shooting memorial,https://nbc-2.com/news/weird/2022/09/02/broward-man-arrested-for-leaving-dead-animals-at-school-shooting-memorial/,nottheonion,"BROWARD COUNTY, Fla. — A man is facing multiple charges after placing dead animals at the Parkland shooting memorial outside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.

Robert Mondragon, 29, faces charges of disfiguring a monument, violation of probation for battery, violation of a risk protection order and five charges for indecent exposure.

Broward Sheriff’s Office detectives said that during their investigation, they noticed that the man had a fascination with mass school shootings.

The dead animals were discovered throughout July by a school guard and a deputy.

Detectives said on July 20, a school crossing guard discovered a dead duck with its chest cavity cut open on a bench at the MSD Memorial Garden. On July 21st, the school crossing guard found a dead raccoon on the same memorial bench, and on July 31, a deputy found a dead opossum on the bench.

Surveillance video detected a white Nissan with black rims leaving the memorial on July 31, later that night BSO Parkland deputy spotted the vehicle, which had illegal window tint, and a traffic stop was conducted.

“The deputy said Mondragon was the only person in the car, and the deputy saw bird feathers and blood on the front passenger side floorboard. Mondragon told the deputy he had the dead bird in his car because he likes “the metal and blood smell that emits from the dead animal,” according to the report.

BSO V.I.P.E.R. (Violence Intervention Proactive Enforcement Response) detectives received information about Mondragon’s whereabouts and they arrested Mondragon on August 4th for violating his probation for battery and indecent exposure and for violating his risk protection order.

As detectives continued with the investigation, they found photos of the dead animals on Mondragon’s phone.

They said Mondragon’s facial tattoos resemble those of Tate Langdon, the character from the television series American Horror Story based on the Columbine High School massacre. They said they also found text messages about school shootings and internet searches about school shooters.

At this time, Mondragon is being held without bond."

Lake Erie fishing tournament rocked by cheating scandal after contestants allegedly caught stuffing fish with weights,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fishing-tournament-cheating-weights-lake-erie-walleye-trail-chase-cominsky-jake-runyan/,nottheonion,"A Lake Erie fishing tournament ended with the event's original winners caught up in a cheating controversy.

On Friday, the Lake Erie Walleye Trail (LEWT) fishing tournament in Ohio crowned Chase Cominsky and Jake Runyan winners after weigh-in. But in a video posted to the tournament's Facebook page, one of the contestants appears to question the results on stage before the video cuts off.

Another video [Warning: the linked video contains graphic language] widely shared online captures chaos erupting after one of the winners' fish is sliced open and found to be stuffed with lead weights and other fish filets. One by one, the contestants' other fish are gutted, each of them revealed to contain items stuffed inside to add weight to the catches.

The man who cut open the fish can be heard screaming ""we got weights in the fish!"" and yelling at one of the two alleged cheaters ""get outta here!""

The dramatic footage showed an increasingly outraged crowd gathering around the contestants, accusing them of cheating in previous tournaments as well and threatening to call the cops, saying that the two men had essentially stolen thousands of dollars from other competitors.

In a subsequent Facebook post, tournament director Jason Fischer listed the true winners of the tournament after Cominsky and Runyan were disqualified and apologized for the cheating scandal.

""Disgusted guys and gals, I'm sorry for letting you down for so long and I'm glad I caught cheating taking place in YOUR LEWT at the same time,"" he posted.

""I hope you know now that when I say 'you built this LEWT and I will defend its integrity at all costs', I mean it. You all deserve the best,"" Fischer added."
"Mississippi governor, who opposed water system repairs, blames Jackson for crisis",https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/mississippi-governor-who-opposed-water-system-repairs-blames-jackson-for-crisis,nottheonion,"JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Years before people in Jackson were recently left without running water for several days, Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves claimed to have helped block money to fund water system repairs in the capital city.

Reeves, a Republican, blames Jackson’s water crisis on mismanagement at the city level. The city’s latest water troubles are far from its first, and they have stemmed from decaying infrastructure beyond one water treatment plant. The EPA said 300 boil water notices have been issued over the past two years in the city.

READ MORE: Decades of systemic racism seen as root of Jackson Mississippi water crisis

As Reeves climbed Mississippi’s political ladder, he cited his opposition to financially helping the capital as evidence of his fiscal conservatism. Jackson-area lawmakers say the troubled water system is one example of Jackson’s status as a political punching bag for Republican officials, who control the Legislature and the state Bond Commission.

“We operate under the golden rule here,” said Democratic Sen. John Horhn of Jackson. “And the golden rule is: He who has the gold makes the rules.”

In Jackson, 80 percent of residents are Black, and 25 percent live in poverty. Repeated breakdowns made it unsafe for people to drink from their tap, brush their teeth and wash their dishes without boiling the water first. At a September news conference, Reeves said water service was restored to most of the city only after the state “stepped in” to provide emergency repairs. He also said that he didn’t anticipate a need for the Legislature to approve more debt for Jackson’s water system.

The specter of another weather-induced water stoppage looms large for some Jackson residents. “Winter is coming,” said Brooke Floyd, a local activist. “He’s saying it’s fixed. But it’s not fixed.”

Water service was also cut off in parts of the city due to a winter storm in 2010. By June 2011, Reeves was locked in a Republican primary campaign for lieutenant governor. As the tea party movement thrust government spending to the center of political debate, his opponent lambasted him for signing off on bond debt increases.

WATCH: Jackson water crisis exposes consequences of aging infrastructure

With election day just weeks away, Reeves — who was the state treasurer — appeared on a conservative talk radio show to push his track record as a tightfisted “watchdog” over state legislators eager to borrow. The host, Paul Gallo, wanted to know why Reeves had voted to approve most bond projects as a member of the state Bond Commission. His voting record didn’t tell the whole story, Reeves said. For instance, take the millions in bonds the city had requested to repair its crumbling water and sewer infrastructure.

“I’ve never voted against that because it’s never gotten to the Bond Commission. We are talking to the city of Jackson,” Reeves said. “If we are not comfortable, we never bring it up for a vote.”

The Bond Commission decided not to consider issuing bonds for Jackson water projects that had been authorized by the Legislature, Reeves said.

“Let’s just say there is an economic development in a town that doesn’t have a lot of political power,” Gallo responded. “The Bond Commission can just refuse to take it up? … Isn’t that the same thing as a negative vote?”

“It is the same thing as a negative vote,” Reeves said.

Most years, the Legislature authorizes projects in one king-sized measure, known in legislators’ parlance as “the big bond bill.” Then, the Bond Commission — made up of the governor, attorney general and state treasurer — votes on whether to issue the bonds.

The commission issues most bonds that come up for a vote. In 2011, Reeves’ primary opponent said Reeves voted during his two terms as state treasurer to approve too much debt. But some bonds aren’t brought to a vote or are delayed, such as those proposed for Jackson water and sewer improvements.

WATCH: How Jackson, Mississippi’s water crisis is a sign of larger racial inequities

In response to questions at a September news conference, Reeves said his recollection of what happened in 2010 is that the city never prepared the necessary paperwork to receive water bonds authorized by the Legislature. A document obtained by The Associated Press shows city leaders prepared a proposal in 2010 asking the state for $13.5 million in bonds for water system upgrades downtown. The Legislature later approved a dwarfed bond proposal for $6 million.

But after the Legislature’s approval, Reeves and Republican Gov. Haley Barbour initially failed to include the city’s water project in the state bonds to be issued in the fall of 2010.

The Legislature added an application requirement for the bond, which former Mississippi Department of Finance and Administration spokeswoman Kym Wiggins told the Jackson Free Press was “exclusive” to Jackson at the time. In order to have its application approved, Reeves said the city would need to answer a number of questions about how the money would be spent.

Barbour and Reeves later relented and voted to approve the bond after city officials made commitments that included funding projects through low-interest loans, rather than the interest-free loans outlined in the legislation.

The governor’s office told the AP that as state treasurer, Reeves ultimately voted to approve the bonds. But in the June 2011 interview with Gallo, he said the Bond Commission had refused to put Jackson water bonds on its agenda.

“We make the decision prior to it being on the agenda such that there is not an actual vote,” Reeves said.

Before the Bond Commission gets involved, bond bills proposed by Jackson-area lawmakers frequently fail to make it out of the Legislature.

In the 2022 legislative session, a bill that would have authorized $4 million in bonds for Jackson water and sewer improvements died in committee. Another would have appropriated money to construct a separate water system for Jackson State University, which had to bring in temporary restrooms and portable showers in August as discolored water flowed through dorm faucets.

At another September news conference, Reeves said the state gave Jackson $200 million over the last several years to address its water problems. But the numbers Reeves’ office gave Jackson television station WLBT-TV include revenue generated from measures like a 1 percent sales tax paid only by people who shop in Jackson.

“That is not money that comes from the state of Mississippi,” said Democratic state Rep. Earle Banks of Jackson. “That is money that comes from the citizens of Jackson and people who do business in the city of Jackson.”

With population decline eroding Jackson’s tax base, voters in 2014 overwhelmingly approved a 1 percent local sales tax for infrastructure repairs. The Jackson city council asked for legislative approval for another election to double that local tax to 2 cents on the dollar. A bill to increase the sales tax died in the 2021 legislative session.

Reeves said Jackson needed to fix its problems with its billing system before “asking everyone else to pony up more money.”

Efforts to attract private investment by keeping taxes low have long been central to Reeves’ economic thinking.

The government does not create jobs; it simply “creates an environment which encourages the private sector to invest capital,” Reeves said in the 2011 interview with Gallo. “And the infrastructure around that is a function of government.”

Reeves said government has a role to play in building infrastructure to hasten development. Those economic principles have not been applied to Jackson, some officials said.

“Look, we can we can bury our heads in the sand and say, ‘Jackson’s problem is not our problem,’” Horhn said. “But when you hear there ain’t no water, and you can’t brush your teeth or take a crap, you strike Mississippi from the list.”

Pope Francis urges mothers to stop ironing son's shirts and urge them to get married,https://www.somersetlive.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/pope-francis-tells-mums-stop-7262759,nottheonion,"Never miss Somerset's latest and breaking news again by signing up to our Daily Newsletter

Pope Francis has urged mothers to stop ironing their son's shirts and encourage them to get married. The 85-year-old head of the Catholic church, who has never been married and does not have children, made the comments during a service to mark the end of the 10th World Meeting of Families.

He also told adult men not to ""take the easy road"" and return to their mothers in ""moments of difficulty"". The Pope said: ""We see so many young men who don't have the courage to get married and mothers often say to me 'do something, speak to my son, who is not getting married and is 37-years-old'.

""But Signora, don't iron his shirts, make the first move by sending him out, let him leave the nest."" At the service, which was held at the Vatican in Rome over the weekend, the Pope said that familial love ""is not possessive, it's for freedom always"".

""And then, in the moments of difficulty, in crises – all families have them – please don't take the easy road: 'I'm going back to mum',"" he added, addressing adult men. ""No, move ahead with this courageous gamble.

""There will be difficult moments, hard moments, but move ahead, always."""
Accidental discovery that scallops love ‘disco’ lights leads to new fishing technique,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/18/accidental-discovery-that-scallops-love-disco-lights-leads-to-new-fishing-technique,nottheonion,"An unusual technique for catching scallops that was stumbled upon accidentally by scientists could potentially reduce some of the damage caused to our seabeds by fishing.

The marine scientist Dr Rob Enever and his team at Fishtek Marine, a fisheries consultancy based in Devon, designed small underwater “potlights” to help protect fish stocks by replacing the need to use fish to bait crab and lobster pots.

The lights were supposed to attract crabs into the pots. But quite unexpectedly, scallops, which can have up to 200 eyes, were more attracted to the LED lights. “It’s like a scallop disco – illuminate the trap and they come in. It’s astonishing that no one else has discovered this before. It’s quite an exciting find,” said Enever.

00:18 Scallops jump into pots with ‘disco’ lights in potential new fishing strategy – video

“This has the potential to open up a whole new inshore fishery and that’s a global first.”

Commercially, scallops are the most valuable fishery in England and the fourth most valuable in the UK, according to the latest government sea fisheries statistics. Most are caught by dredging, which at an industrial-scale is damaging to marine habitats. However, using scuba divers to hand-pick them is labour intensive, time-consuming and therefore more expensive.

Enever hopes scallop potting could create a low-input, low-impact fishery that supplements the income of crab and lobster fishers with this high-value catch.

In 2019, Enever, who specialises in reducing the impacts of fishing on the marine environment using technology, trialled the potlights with the Newlyn-based fisher Jon Ashworth off the Cornish coast. Although Ashworth did not notice any difference in crab or lobster catches, he found huge numbers of European king scallops in his pots.

“Pretty much every pot that we hauled had scallops in them and yet every haul without lights had no scallops. It was conclusive, there and then,” said Ashworth. “To have proof that lights can be used to catch scallops has got to have some awesome implications looking forward.”

In further experiments, a total of 1,886 pots were hauled – 985 experimental pots with lights caught 518 scallops; 901 control pots without lights caught only two. Overall, 99.6% of scallops were caught in pots with lights. This research, funded by Defra and Natural England, is outlined in a peer-reviewed paper published in the Journal of Fisheries Research this week.

Dr Bryce Stewart, a marine ecologist and fisheries biologist at the University of York, has studied scallops for more than 20 years and co-authored the paper with Evener alongside scientists at the University of Exeter.

“This is one of the most exciting things I have come across in my whole career – it’s such a surprise,” said Stewart, who describes scallop eyes as ‘pretty weird’. Scallops can have up to 200 eyes on their mantle, along the inner edges of their shell openings.

“Most animals, including us, have lenses but scallops don’t. They have mirrors at the back of their eyes and they also have two retinas, one which senses darker things, one that senses lighter things, so they can possibly use that contrast to sense movement. Perhaps they prefer illuminated areas because they provide safety from predators or because it’s easier to find the plankton they eat.”

Powered by two rechargeable AA batteries, each small potlight is secured inside the pot and is expected to last between five and 10 years. The trap design has been modified with a ramp for easier access into the modified pot and Enever continues to refine the potlight technology – tank experiments indicate that scallops are more attracted to blue light than white light, for example. If the team can design a light system aimed specifically to catch scallops, that could open up the possibilities of doing this at scale, according to Stewart.

“Scallops are famous for their good vision,” said Dr Vicky Sleight, a marine biologist at the University of Aberdeen. “Scallop eyes have a surprisingly high degree of visual clarity and their attraction to artificial light is intriguing. Follow-up laboratory experiments are required to understand why they are attracted into pots, and if it’s a reliable and reproducible behaviour at a range of different types of scallop sites, then it’s certainly an exciting prospect to grow a more sustainable scallop fishery.”

The Fishtek team are repeating these experiments in four more UK locations, from Lyme Bay to the Orkney Islands, using different trap designs in various conditions and depths.

“Our goal is to get as close to a commercially viable fishery as we can,” added Enever. “I genuinely think we can do that, it’s got mileage.”

New research indicates that straight men who play guitar in extreme metal bands do it to impress other straight men,https://www.loudersound.com/news/new-research-indicates-that-straight-men-who-play-guitar-in-extreme-metal-bands-do-it-to-impress-other-straight-men,nottheonion,"John Lennon once famously suggested that ""one of the main reasons to get on stage is that it's the quickest way of making contact."" He was, of course, talking about getting laid. It's certainly true that the historically male-dominated arena of rock 'n' roll has led to some unhealthy dynamics when it comes to sex, but do that many straight men who play guitar really do it to boost their chances with women?

According to a new study, there's actually another, surprising factor in play - at least when it comes to extreme metal. Following a spicy truth-nugget shared by the official Twitter account of QI - the British TV panel show based around interesting facts and whose social media channels are run by a thorough team of researchers - a new study has indicated that the reason many straight male guitarists begin playing extreme metal is to...er...show off to other straight male guitarists.

""Research shows that heterosexual men who learn to play extreme metal guitar are mostly motivated to do so in order to impress other heterosexual men,"" reads QI's Tweet, posted yesterday (October 2). Needless to say, it sparked an immediate debate, most of which, unlike much of social media, was actually in good jest.

One user even went and found the original study, conducted by Tara DeLecce, Farid Pazhoohi, Anna Szala and Todd K. Shackelford, on which QI's Tweet was based. Conducted earlier this year and posted on Psychnet, while the minutiae of the research involved is behind a paywall, Psychnet's summary reveals that 44 straight male guitarists were surveyed for the study. While the results do reveal that some aspects of playing guitar are linked to a desire to get laid (which is a bit depressing - come on, lads, it's 2022), other aspects intrinsically linked to extreme metal are rooted in mens' desire to impress their fellow guitar bros.

""There are two main competing hypotheses for the function of music: sexual selection or byproduct of the complexity of the human brain,"" the study states. ""Although there is evidence that playing music increases male attractiveness, the sexual selection explanation may not be mutually exclusive to all types of music.""

The study goes on to highlight that extreme metal music in particular is a genre of rock that is dominated by men both on stage and off, so the ""sexual selection"" theory might not apply.

""Extreme metal is a genre that is heavily male-biased, not only among the individuals that play this style of music, but also among the fans of the genre,"" it continues. ""Therefore, it is unlikely that extreme metal musicians are primarily trying to increase their mating success through their music. However, musicians in this genre heavily invest their time in building technical skills (e.g., dexterity, coordination, timing), which raises the question of the purpose behind this costly investment. It could be that men engage in this genre mainly for status-seeking purposes: to intimidate other males with their technical skills and speed and thus gain social status.""

""To explore the reasoning behind investment in technical guitar skills,"" it explains, ""a sample of 44 heterosexual male metal guitarists was recruited and surveyed about their practicing habits...sexual behavior...and feelings of competitiveness toward the same sex.""

Revealing the study's findings, the site notes: ""The survey results indicated that time spent playing chords predicted desire for casual sex with women whereas perceptions of playing speed positively predicted intrasexual competitiveness (a desire to impress other men).""

So there you go. The faster the shredding, the more you're trying to show off to your guy mates, apparently! We'd take these findings with a pinch of salt (44 is hardly the most definitive sample number), so don't get too bent out of shape if you're one of the many straight male extreme metal guitarists out there who simply play because extreme metal is fucking awesome! Just be aware that, if the research is to be believed, there may be some peers out there who are determined to out-noodle you."

Cam Site Offers Hans Niemann $1 Million to Play Chess Nude to Prove He Didn't Cheat,https://dnyuz.com/2022/09/15/cam-site-offers-hans-niemann-1-million-to-play-chess-nude-to-prove-he-didnt-cheat/,nottheonion,"A popular cam site extended is offering $1 million to controversial Grandmaster Hans Niemann to broadcast himself playing a live game of chess completely naked. The offer is supposed to help him prove he did not cheat when he beat Magnus Carlsen, the world’s top-ranked chess player, in a tournament last week.

Stripchat, an adult webcam site that claims to have a monthly viewership of 400 million people, says it sent a letter to Niemann congratulating him on his victory, and extending sympathies for all the accusations of cheating against him. The cheating scandal has lit the chess world on fire, and has become the biggest scandal in chess in recent memory.

“Congratulations on your victory against world No. 1 Magnus Carlsen,” the letter reads. “It’s a shame you’re being ridiculed by the chess community for potentially cheating. Claims that you used wireless vibrating anal beads to gain an upper hand are ridiculous.”

Electronic anal beads, connected to an AI that would vibrate to tell Niemann what moves to play, is just one of the many theories circulating around his victory at the Sinquefield Cup in St. Louis two weeks ago.

Other theories suggest that Carlsen’s prep work for the tournament was leaked, allowing Niemann—who, despite being a notably young Grandmaster, was ranked the lowest in the tournament—to beat him. Others theorized that Niemann could have used a “shoe computer” connected to an AI, thus, the suggestion that he play nude.

Niemann has been staunch in defending his honor, and there is still no actual evidence that he cheated.

“I know you even offered to strip completely naked to prove to people you didn’t cheat,” the Stripchat letter reads.

“Well….being that Stripchat is an adult entertainment webcam platform that receives 400 million views on average each month, I wanted to extend you an offer to do just that,” the letter continues. “Prove the haters wrong once and for all. Strip naked and play a game of chess live on Stripchat in return for up to $1 million.”

Stripchat is known for stunts like this. The platform has previously offered free private cam shows to people who got a COVID booster (called “B0ner Booster”), has launched a SPAC it called “StripSPAC,” offered a job to disgraced CNN and New Yorker journalist Jeffrey Toobin, who was infamously caught masturbating on a work Zoom call, and promised to donate a dollar for every man who promised to continue masturbating during “No Nut November,” according to press releases emailed to Motherboard.

No word yet on whether Niemann, a 19-year-old from San Francisco, will take Stripchat up on the offer. Niemann did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Motherboard.

Elon Musk has even weighed in on the situation, supporting an idea that anal beads were used to facilitate cheating.The match in question happened on September 4, during the Sinquefield Cup, one of the longest running chess tournaments in the United States. It is the final leg of the Grand Chess Tour and features some of the world’s best chess players, as well as a $350,000 total prize fund.In round three of the cup, Magnus Carlsen, 31, a chess grandmaster from Norway, played against Hans Niemann, 19, a chess prodigy originally from San Francisco.Carlsen is a five-time grand champion and one of the greatest chess players in the world. He’s been a chess phenom since he was 13 and there is even a documentary about him, titled, that found a general audience beyond just chess players. Niemann is also a grandmaster, though according to worldchess.com, Niemann was the lowest-rated player at the tournament.Niemann had beaten Carlsen before in an online tournament in Miami, where he famously said, “the chess speaks for itself” at his victory interview. He went on to lose two out of the next three games to Carlsen, and ended the event with 0 points.So it shocked the chess world then when Niemann beat Carlsen in St. Louis.called this "" an upset for the ages ."" Carlsen had played 53 classical matches without a loss (the match where he previously lost to Niemann was a non-classical match) and Carlsen was playing white, which has a statistical advantage over black, since white moves first in chess.In an interview posted to the St. Louis Chess Club's YouTube channel , Niemann said, “I think [Carlsen] was just so demoralized because he's losing to an idiot like me. It must be embarrassing for the world champion to lose to me. I feel bad for him.""The following day, Carlsen tweeted that he had withdrawn from the tournament. It was the first time he'd ever pulled out of a competitive chess event. He added that he enjoys the Saint Louis Chess Club and looks forward to coming back.Carlsen included a short video of Portuguese soccer coach José Mourinho saying, ""If I speak I am in big trouble” in his tweet.Many in the chess world interpreted Carlsen's tweet as the Norwegian grand master accusing Niemann of cheating.But it's unclear how Niemann might have cheated.The match, like all the matches in the Sinquefield Cup, was broadcast live.American chess grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura created a YouTube video outlining his theory as to why Niemann's unusual strategy was, to Nakamura's mind, evidence he might have cheated. Right now, the video has almost a million views referenced an idea involving a hypothetical player ""using vibration-based buttons in a player’s shoes"" to communicate with a chess engine. A chess engine is a computer program that can be used to analyze the configuration of pieces on the chess board and then suggest moves to human players.The vibrating shoes morphed into the notion that Niemann was communicating using a ""prostate massager.""Tesla and Space-X CEO Elon Musk took that as his cue to enter the fray. In a tweet that has since been deleted, Grimes' ex-husband augmented a quote from 19th Century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer to fit the current controversy.""Talent hits a target no one else can hit, genius hits a target no one can see (cause it’s in ur butt),"" Musk wrote in response to the above tweet. Other theories about how Niemann may have cheated include that he was tipped off about Carlsen’s surprise opening of 1 d4 Nf6 2 c4 e6 3 Nc3 Bb4 4 g3. Niemann was prepared for the opening and some believe it may have been leaked. Analysis of the game play between Niemann and Carlsen shows both making mistakes, which would seem to indicate that Niemann did not use computer aid, according to the Guardian In the wake of the cheating allegations, Sinquefield Cup organizers began broadcasting the matches on a 15-minute delay and taking additional security measures. Plus, Niemann, despite Carlsen never confirming accusations of cheating, has been banned from chess.com, the largest chess site in the world, and was uninvited from the Chess.com Global Championship, a $1 million event.On Sunday, Iranian-born chess grandmaster Alireza Firouzja won the Sinquefield Cup , taking home the $100,000 grand prize.Firouzja, who like Niemann is 19-years-old, seems to have avoided any allegations of cheating in his victory.The Sinquefield Cup is named for Rex Sinquefield, famed supporter of libertarian causes and very rich man. The tournament is a 10-player round robin with the top three winners taking home cash prizes."

Bermuda Triangle cruise promises full refund if ship disappears,https://www.aninews.in/news/world/us/bermuda-triangle-cruise-promises-full-refund-if-ship-disappears20220528133840/,nottheonion,"New York [US], May 28 (ANI): In a bizarre offer, a cruise bound for the mysterious Bermuda Triangle has promised passengers that they will receive a full refund if the ship disappears, UK media reported.

The infamous Bermuda Triangle, also known as the Devil's Triangle, has remained a mystery for mankind as dozens of ships and flights have mysteriously disappeared in this region, stated the media.

The reason behind the disappearances has remained unexplained and has been attributed to the outcome of weather and human error. Conspiracy theorists have blamed supernatural causes and aliens for the disappearances of ships and flights.

In an advertisement on its website, the travel agency, the Ancient Mysteries Cruise, has said: ""Don't worry about disappearing on this Bermuda Triangle tour. The tour has a 100 per cent return rate and your money will be refunded in the rare chance you disappear.""

Passengers will undertake their journey to the Atlantic ocean on the Norwegian Prima liner heading from New York to Bermuda in March next year.

According to the advertisement, guests can enjoy an exclusive twilight Bermuda Triangle cruise on a glass-bottom boat with talks and Q&As.

The passengers have to shell out around £1,450 for a cabin on the ship for the eccentric offer. (ANI)"
"Enterprise dings woman who rented truck on sunny day more than $5,500 for hail damage",https://www.cbc.ca/news/gopublic/enterprise-vehicle-damage-hail-1.6312420,nottheonion,"Keli Chick never expected a one-day rental from Enterprise Rent-A-Car to turn into a year-long battle over a damage claim for more than $5,500.

Her fight with the biggest car rental company in North America began when she rented a truck in Dawson Creek, B.C., on Dec. 29, 2020 and drove it to Red Deer, Alta., the next morning — a seven-hour trip.

The skies were blue and the sun was shining, so Chick says she was more than a little surprised when a letter from Enterprise's damage recovery department arrived six weeks later, saying she was on the hook for $5,578, due to hail damage.

""I was pretty shocked,"" said Chick. ""I had to read it a few times just because it was so out there. I thought, 'This cannot be possible.'""

Go Public has heard from about a dozen other Enterprise customers who say they, too, were told long after their rental period was over that they were responsible for various repairs costing thousands of dollars.

A consumer advocate and lawyer, who is an expert on contract law, says car rental companies have to inform customers of damage in a timely manner — and can't just tell them they have to foot the bill for repairs.

""The onus is on the rental car company to prove their allegations,"" said Daniel Tsai, who teaches consumer and business law at Ryerson University in Toronto. ""If they say that you've caused the damage, they actually have to provide some evidence.""

Enterprise turned Chick’s case over to the collection agency Credifax, which sent numerous letters and threatened to take her to court. (Colin Hall/CBC)

A picture is worth… nothing?

Before leaving the Enterprise location, Chick and an agent completed a walk-around inspection and noted a scratch on a door and a broken tail light. The truck's roof and hood were covered in snow and ice, says Chick, but she assumed they were in good condition.

As she hit the highway the next morning, the sun melted the frozen white stuff off her rental vehicle. A photo Chick stopped to take of the horizon happened to include part of the hood and captured pock marks from what appeared to be hail.

When she arrived in Red Deer, the agent who signed off on the truck's return told her not to worry about the obvious dents.

""He didn't add the hail damage because clearly the weather was a beautiful day and no hail damage had occurred when it was in my possession,"" said Chick.

It wasn't until six weeks later that Chick received the Enterprise letter, telling her she'd received ""significantly discounted repair rates"" and that she was responsible to pay the cost.

Contract law expert Daniel Tsai says the onus to prove damage occurred during a rental period is on the rental companies, and that unhappy customers should fight damage claims in court. (Sue Goodspeed/CBC)

Chick thought she had insurance, because she'd paid with a credit card — most provide coverage. But she discovered that credit cards only cover car rentals, not trucks. On top of that, she says, filling out an insurance claim would have been fraudulent, because she wasn't responsible for the damage.

She sent Enterprise the photo and a link to a local TV weather report that said there had been clear skies during her rental period. A meteorologist at Environment and Climate Change Canada later confirmed that for Go Public.

""They told me that that didn't matter,"" she said. ""They were very clear that this was my fault.""

Enterprise sent her case to the collection agency Credifax, which added interest to the repair bill — so it grew to over $6,200 — and threatened legal action.

""Every time I tried to reach them [Enterprise], they completely ignored me and just kind of gave me the runaround,"" said Chick. ""It's a lot of time. A lot of energy. And just so frustrating that this has happened for a whole year.""

Enterprise told Pat Abbott three months after she returned a rental car that she owed more than $12,000 for a blown motor — a problem for which the car was under recall. (Submitted by Pat Abbott)

Can't 'conclusively determine' fault

Enterprise spokesperson Lisa Martini told Go Public that the company's terms and conditions spell out that customers are responsible for damage caused by an ""act of God,"" which includes hail. If they don't have insurance that cost becomes an out-of-pocket expense.

Similar clauses exist in agreements for the three companies that account for an estimated 95 per cent of all car rentals in Canada: Enterprise (which owns National and Alamo), Avis (which owns Budget) and Hertz (which owns Dollar and Thrifty).

After Go Public requested an interview with Enterprise, the company dropped its claim against Chick.

In a statement, Martini said the company was ""unable to conclusively determine"" when the truck was damaged so ""the wrong renter was likely held responsible.""

But the rental company's about-face doesn't sit well with Tsai.

""You deny a claim you can't even prove and make the customer go through a horrendous experience where they might even have to go to court?"" he said. ""That's a major marketing fail.""

Enterprise eventually dropped both claims against Chick and Abbott. (Sam Nar/CBC)

Vehicle recalled

Likewise, Pat Abbott didn't find out for three months that she was supposedly responsible for $12,322 in damages to the 2020 Elantra she'd driven for a month. Enterprise said the motor was shot.

""I said, 'I'm not paying this. That car was in perfect condition,"" Abbott, 71, said from her home in Abbotsford, B.C.

She then learned that that model of vehicle had been recalled due to motor issues.

""I was livid,"" she said. ""The motor was under recall, so why are they pinning the damage on me?""

WATCH | Woman charged more than $5,500 for hail damage on rented truck: Rental company charges customer for hail damage | Go Public Duration 1:52 An Alberta woman says Enterprise charged her for thousands of dollars in hail damage to a truck she rented, even though it was sunny during her rental period.

Enterprise ended up dropping the claim — after it emerged that the vehicle's odometer showed almost 1,300 kilometres more than when Abbott had returned it. Its letter to Abbott did not include an apology.

Taking months to hit a customer with a major repair bill is too long, says Tsai.

""There should definitely be a time limit if there's any damage or any circumstance where the customer owes additional money,"" he said. ""That delay is totally unacceptable. And in fact, it makes it suspicious.""

Enterprise says a ""miscommunication"" caused the claim to be sent out while the cause of the engine failure was being determined.

It says fewer than 0.2 per cent of all rentals in Canada last year resulted in cases ""where the customer had a concern with the way the claim was handled.""

When asked, Martini, the spokesperson, said she could not say what percentage of renters who had a concern about their claim weren't satisfied with the outcome.

Nor is it clear what percentage of Enterprise's total rentals for 2021 resulted in claims.

Martini also said in the statement it can take ""several weeks"" to inform customers of damage because it ""is not always noticeable immediately"" and that a bill isn't sent out until repairs are complete.

Tsai says the car rental industry is ""long overdue"" for regulatory oversight.

""We should have a regulatory standard in place where car companies that make their claims have to prove it before they pursue them,"" said Tsai.

""And have to provide some kind of mediation process to get these things dealt with fairly and quickly – to ensure that rental car companies are accountable to their customers.""

Keli Chick says she's relieved the hail damage problem is over, but that she'll be holding Enterprise accountable in a different way.

""I'm telling everybody I know not to use that company ever again,"" she said. ""I will never go back to them."""
Kingsland water tower shot; silhouette of Johnny Cash struck in sensitive spot,https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2022/may/15/kingsland-water-tower-shot-silhouette-of-johnny/,nottheonion,"One of Johnny Cash's hit songs, ""Don't Take Your Guns to Town,"" is about a man being urged to leave his guns at home, but the man in the song doesn't listen, and someone is still not listening.

Upon arriving at the Kingsland municipal building early Tuesday, the city's water office manager Betty Graham discovered that a hole had been shot through the adjacently located water tower tank. But it does not appear to be a random shot as the precise location of the bullet hole makes it appear that the image of the Man in Black is relieving himself.

Despite the humor some might find in such a stunt, Kingsland City Council Member Sharon Crosby said the vandalism is being taken seriously.

""Kingsland received a $300,000 grant that we used to entirely refurbish the interior and exterior of the city water receptacle,"" she said. ""After realizing what had happened Tuesday morning, our water department director contacted state and local authorities regarding the vandalism. At this point we are waiting to hear more from the investigation, but Cleveland County has a very good sheriff's department. Sheriff Jack Rogers and investigator Gary Young are working hard to find the responsible person.""

This is not the first time the tower has been shot.

""This happened before in 1993 when [someone] shot a hole in the tank. He was charged with a class 3 felony and fined $11,000.""

In honor and recognition of the fact that Kingsland is the birthplace of Cash, a silhouette of him holding a guitar along with the town name of Kingsland in large script was painted on the water tower during the 2021 renovation project, Crosby said.

Britt Talent, Cleveland County Herald newspaper publisher and founding member of the ""Kick-Start Cleveland County"" organization, said fixing the tank will be expensive.

""Whoever did this broke federal law damaging a public utility,"" he said. ""It is a very serious issue. Repairs are initially estimated to run over $100,000. In addition, until the repairs can be undertaken, the water pump is running almost constantly to maintain proper water levels and pressure in the tank. The response we've received on our Facebook page is well over 95% highly irate at this senseless act of destruction.""

Kingsland, population of about 400, located on U.S. 79, has taken great pride in being the early childhood home of Cash, known as one of the greatest country music singer/songwriters to ever grace a stage. In honor of that fact, the Kingsland Heritage Center committee is working toward converting the former Kingsland grammar school Sturgis Music building into a local museum recognizing Cash along with numerous other notable figures who came from Kingsland.

Kingsland is the childhood home of Johnny Cash. Authorities are investigating some vandalism that damaged a silhouette of Cash that adorns the city's water tower. (Special to The Commercial/Richard Ledbetter)

"SFPD put rape victims’ DNA into database used to find criminals, DA alleges",https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/02/sfpd-put-rape-victims-dna-into-database-used-to-find-criminals-da-alleges/,nottheonion,"The San Francisco Police Department's crime lab has been checking DNA collected from sexual assault victims to determine whether any of the victims committed a crime, according to District Attorney Chesa Boudin, who called for an immediate end to the alleged practice.

""The crime lab attempts to identify crime suspects by searching a database of DNA evidence that contains DNA collected from rape and sexual assault victims,"" Boudin's office said in a press release yesterday. Boudin's release denounced the alleged ""practice of using rape and sexual assault victims' DNA to attempt to subsequently incriminate them.""

""Boudin said his office was made aware of the purported practice last week, after a woman's DNA collected years ago as part of a rape exam was used to link her to a recent property crime,"" the San Francisco Chronicle reported yesterday. The woman ""was recently arrested on suspicion of a felony property crime, with police identifying her based on the rape-kit evidence she gave as a victim, Boudin said."" That was the only example provided, and Boudin gave few details about the case to protect the woman's privacy. But the database may include ""thousands of victims' DNA profiles, with entries over 'many, many years,' Boudin said,"" according to the Chronicle.

""We should encourage survivors to come forward—not collect evidence to use against them in the future. This practice treats victims like evidence, not human beings. This is legally and ethically wrong,"" Boudin said.

Separately, Boudin is facing a recall election in June over allegations that he hasn't been tough enough on crime. Advertisement

Police chief announces investigation

San Francisco Police Chief Bill Scott said the department will investigate and that he is ""committed to ending the practice"" if Boudin's allegation is accurate. But Scott also said the suspect cited by Boudin may have been identified from a different DNA database.

""We will immediately begin reviewing our DNA collection practices and policies... Although I am informed of the possibility that the suspect in this case may have been identified through a DNA hit in a non-victim DNA database, I think the questions raised by our district attorney today are sufficiently concerning that I have asked my assistant chief for operations to work with our Investigations Bureau to thoroughly review the matter and report back to me and to our DA's office partners,"" Scott said in a statement published by KRON 4.

Scott also said, ""I am informed that our existing DNA collection policies have been legally vetted and conform with state and national forensic standards,"" but he noted that ""there are many important principles for which the San Francisco Police Department stands that go beyond state and national standards.""

""We must never create disincentives for crime victims to cooperate with police, and if it's true that DNA collected from a rape or sexual assault victim has been used by SFPD to identify and apprehend that person as a suspect in another crime, I'm committed to ending the practice,"" Scott said.

Local lawmakers plan legislation

During examinations of people reporting sexual assaults, ""biological evidence from bodily fluids, fingernail scrapings, and bite and scratch marks is collected from the victim's body,"" Boudin's announcement explained. ""The victim submits their own DNA sample in order to exclude DNA that comes from the victim, as opposed to the suspect.""

State Senator Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco) and District 9 Supervisor Hillary Ronen are planning legislation at both the state and city level to stop the alleged misuse of DNA and are both quoted in Boudin's announcement. Wiener said that ""if survivors believe their DNA may end up being used against them in the future, they'll have one more reason not to participate in the rape kit process. That's why I'm working with the DA's office to address this problem through state legislation, if needed.""

Despite the plan for legislation, Boudin said the crime lab's alleged practice may already be illegal. ""If DNA from a rape kit was used without consent for purposes other than investigating the underlying rape case, it may be a violation of constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and seizures as well as California's Victims' Bill of Rights, Boudin said,"" according to the San Francisco Chronicle article.

Women’s groups slam use of DNA

Women's groups spoke out against the alleged use of victims' DNA. Rape exams should not be ""used to self-incriminate past survivors of sexual assault and rape,"" Pamela Tate, co-executive director of Black Women Revolt Against Domestic Violence, said in Boudin's press release. ""Rape survivors do not give law enforcement a blanket waiver of their rights to not self-incriminate. This type of misrepresentation will have a chilling effect to Black women and women of color in reporting crimes of sexual assault.""

Orchid Pusey, executive director of the Asian Women's Shelter, said, ""It can be especially frightening for crime survivors who are immigrants or non-native English speakers to come forward to report a crime like domestic violence or sexual assault.""

""Using DNA evidence from a survivor's most vulnerable moments to investigate her years later abuses trust and discourages future survivors' reporting and participation,"" she said."

Premier League considers adding human rights to new owners’ test,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/03/premier-league-considers-adding-human-rights-to-new-owners-test,nottheonion,"The Premier League is considering adding a human rights component to its owners’ and directors’ test as it conducts a review of the controversial regulation.

The review is part of a wide-ranging reassessment of the league’s governance and comes as pressure again grows to expand the criteria by which it assesses prospective owners.

League officials were keen to play down the significance of the review, suggesting it was normal practice and that the consideration of human rights was one of many issues being looked at. Any changes would need to be approved by at least 14 of the league’s 20 clubs. However, the league acknowledges it needs owners who benefit the competition during a period of greater scrutiny from the public and politicians.

The league’s chief executive, Richard Masters, said on Thursday at the Financial Times Business of Sport Summit: “The owners’ and directors’ test has been under a lot of scrutiny over the past 12 months and we’re looking at it again. It’s part of the process of responding to the fan-led review … We’re looking to see if more tests need to be added, if we need to be more transparent and whether those decisions should be approved by an independent body.”

On the consideration of human rights, Masters said: “We’ve had some helpful conversations with Amnesty International about those kinds of things. I’m not ready to say how it should change yet because actually it should be across football; it should be us the FA and the EFL agreeing what that test should be, how it should be implemented and how it should be communicated to fans.”

On Wednesday the leader of the Labour party, Sir Keir Starmer, called for sanctions to be applied against the Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich, after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Abramovich, who has put Chelsea up for sale, has vehemently disputed reports suggesting his alleged closeness to Vladimir Putin and Russia or that he has done anything to merit being sanctioned.

Gary Neville, the Salford City co-owner and campaigner for reform in football, who in January joined the Labour party, said the situation involving Abramovich showed the need for a reinforced owners’ test.

“Do I think [Abramovich] should be kicked out of English football? I’m not there yet but I do think we need a robust fit-and-proper owners’ test,” he told the FT Summit. “It needs to be more robust and resilient. We also need more transparency.”

Last year the takeover of Newcastle United by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund was met with protest by supporters and human rights groups and the government’s fan-led review, led by Tracey Crouch MP, called for an enhanced owners’ and directors’ test when published in November. One condition proposed by Crouch would assess a candidate’s integrity, or whether “the proposed owner is of good character such that they should be allowed to be the custodian of an important community asset”.

The fan-led review was welcomed by the government and there remains expectation that a bill to turn its recommendations into law, including the creation of an independent regulator for the game, will form part of the Queen’s speech later this year. The Premier League remains in regular discussions with government over possible legislation.

The league has held two meetings with Amnesty in recent months to discuss Amnesty’s suggestion of a fully human-rights compliant owners’ test. The Amnesty test called, among other things, for the Premier League board to consider whether a prospective owner or director had been complicit in serious violations of international human rights law or any conduct at odds with the league’s anti-discrimination policy.

Sacha Deshmukh, Amnesty International UK’s CEO, said: “In an era of global sportswashing and with the horror of what is currently unfolding in Ukraine, the Premier League has a clear moral responsibility to change its ownership rules to put a stop to top-flight English football being used as a PR vehicle for those complicit in serious human rights violations.”"
Massachusetts grants absolution to its last remaining witch,https://www.courthousenews.com/massachusetts-grants-absolution-to-its-last-remaining-witch/,nottheonion,"In Salem, 30 people were convicted and 19 were put to death within a four-month period. Five others died in jail, and one man, Giles Corey, was crushed to death by rocks in an effort to torture him into confessing. Johnson herself was spared death when her sentence was commuted by then-Governor William Phips.

Although the reason for Johnson’s confession is unknown, Hite noted that accused witches in Massachusetts were generally put to death only if they professed their innocence. Those who confessed were spared so that they could provide evidence against others.

The Andover hysteria centered largely on Mary Lacey, who accused fellow resident Martha Carrier of negotiating a deal with the devil that would allow her to become Queen of Hell. Seventeen members of Carrier’s family, including Johnson’s mother who was Carrier’s first cousin, ended up being arrested.

Once the hysteria died down, many of the convicted (or their families) petitioned to have the convictions reversed. Johnson submitted a petition in 1712 but was turned down. It’s not clear why, although the fact that she had developmental difficulties and never married or had children may have caused her to be treated as less of a priority.

The Massachusetts Legislature passed bills to exonerate the accused in 1957, shortly after Arthur Miller’s play ""The Crucible"" dramatized the Salem trials, and again in 2001, although the bills focused primarily on people who were put to death. Johnson was once again overlooked and remained the last person in the state guilty of witchcraft in the eyes of the law.

Johnson is believed to have died in 1747 and been buried in an unmarked grave in the Old Burying Ground in North Andover.

Film producer Cassandra Hesseltine, a descendant of Martha Carrier, is working with director Annika Hylmö on a documentary about Johnson’s exoneration. The project set to be called ""The Last Witch"" grew out of a discussion the pair had when they met in a women’s restroom at the Sundance Film Festival.

Ceremonial laws — those that don’t have a practical effect — are frequently taken up by school civics classes, and as many as 200 state laws have been passed as a result of schoolchildren, according to Kevin Underhill, the author of ""The Emergency Sasquatch Ordinance,"" a book about obscure laws.

A litigator at Shook, Hardy & Bacon in San Francisco who blogs regularly on the topic, Underhill said the witch bill is better than most such efforts that tend, for example, to name an official state dinosaur.

“A bill or resolution can still send an important message even if it’s not binding legislation or is a couple of centuries late,” he said. “This one might help in a small way to remind people that it’s better to make decisions based on evidence as opposed to just believing what Goody Putnam posted about witches on Ye Facebooke.”

Although some may believe that legislatures have better things to do with their time, “we shouldn’t exaggerate the amount of time and effort that lawmakers actually spend on this stuff,” Underhill said. He noted that Florida legislators approved a bill to make porpoises the official state saltwater mammal because they didn’t bother looking up the fact that porpoises are a different species from dolphins and aren’t native to Florida.

Laws without substantive effect do have their critics. Congressman Ron Paul, a Texas Republican, was notorious for opposing such legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives, often casting the lone “no” vote on measures to commend organ donors, endorse free and fair elections overseas, or express condolences to earthquake victims.

If nothing else, the exoneration effort in Massachusetts shines light on the fact that it was nearby Andover, not Salem, that was the real epicenter of the hysteria.

Salem gets the attention in part because it has found it profitable to embrace its witch history. The city actively lures tourists with a “witch house,” a witch museum and a statue of Elizabeth Montgomery, the star of the 1960s TV show “Bewitched.” Police cars have a witch logo, a public elementary school is known as Witchcraft Heights and the high school athletic teams are called the Witches. And each year the city has an extremely elaborate Halloween celebration.

By contrast, Andover downplays its spooky backstory. The town is best known today as the home of prestigious Phillips Academy, the country’s oldest prep school that is the alma mater of both Presidents Bush.

Interest in the Salem witch hysteria has endured in part because it can be used as a metaphor for continuing political debates. ""The Crucible"" was widely interpreted as a parable about McCarthyism, and in our own day Robert Mueller felt compelled to testify to Congress that his investigation of Russian election collusion “was not a witch hunt.”

The effort to grant Johnson clemency also highlights the historical mistreatment of socially marginal people and those with intellectual challenges.

Exonerating Johnson “was not deemed necessary in the past because she was not a wife or a mother” and had disabilities, said DiZoglio, the state senator, who also noted the “parallels today to people who don’t look or sound like us or have characteristics that might make people value them as worthy and important.”

Three centuries later, DiZoglio added, Johnson’s cause is relevant because “we see folks targeted all the time for political purposes or agendas.""

“Women’s rights are under attack,” DiZoglio said. ""Reproductive rights are under attack.”

Hesseltine, the film producer, emphasized meanwhile that it’s “very easy for somebody who doesn’t have familial ties to be forgotten.""

""Single women without kids might end up homeless or have to fight harder to get jobs,"" she said. ""A lot of people end up forgotten in mental hospitals or accused of a crime.”

LaPierre was more reticent to draw contemporary parallels in her classroom. “Current events are not a safe area because people might start talking about Trump,” she noted.

No class celebration of the bill-signing has been planned because the students are on summer vacation, “and they don’t care as much,” La Pierre said. “Maybe in 10 years it will sink in.”"
Church of Flying Spaghetti Monster leader's ICBC pirate hat fight continues,https://www.timescolonist.com/bc-news/church-of-flying-spaghetti-monster-leaders-icbc-pirate-hat-fight-continues-5230704,nottheonion,"Gary Smith, the B.C. leader of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, wants to wear a pirate hat in his driver's licence photo. ICBC has deemed the headgear ""unacceptable.""

The B.C. leader of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster continues to battle ICBC in his bid to wear a pirate hat for a driver's licence photo.

Gary Smith of Grand Forks, also known as the church’s captain, argues his pirate hat is part of his church’s religious headwear.

Smith identifies himself as a Pastafarian and a member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster. Members are known to wear either a pasta colander or a three-cornered hat known as a pirate’s tricorn on their heads.

Smith claims ICBC should allow the photo request just as it has already been allowed for his ID as a marriage commissioner and for his firearms acquisition licence.

“I will have you know that as the captain of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster of B.C., a legally constituted religious organization in good standing under the B.C. Society Act, I have successfully argued the right to wear religious headgear in conformance with my beliefs on three other occasions,” Smith said in an April 4 email to ICBC fair practices officer Debby Raffard.

“Ahoy, Debbie,” Smith greeted her in the missive.

Smith had already received a letter from ICBC saying the pirate hat was unacceptable.

“The head covering you wore in Feb. 17, 2022, which is the same brown tricorn hat you have worn on previous occasions for driver’s licence photo applications, was again deemed unacceptable for the purpose of printing on a B.C. driver’s licence, B.C. identification or BC Services Card,” wrote Mario Bourdages, ICBC manager of driver licensing integrity and oversight.

Bourdages wrote Feb. 18 that ICBC “endeavours to accommodate customers whose faith prohibits them from removing a head covering for a photo identification purposes.”

“We do not recognize you as a member of a religious group that requires accommodation in the context of a service customarily available to the public under the British Columbia Human Rights Code,” Bourdage wrote.

However, Smith questions what allows government to decide what set of religious beliefs requires accommodation and what don’t.

“What qualifications grant ICBC the ability to weigh the merits of any faith whatsoever? Hubris!” Smith said.

“The sheer arrogance in only willing to make accommodation if required under the Human Rights Code is shocking in its audacity.

“Ultimately, it remains for us to determine what ICBC is trying to protect in denying me and my crewmates the accommodation we seek,” Smith said.

And it’s not just ICBC Smith finds himself at odds with. He’s also been trying to wear his pirate hat for a security guard licence ID.

“I stridently reassert my right to be depicted in the fashion consistent with my beliefs,” he said in a March letter to licensing authorities.

Smith has already had a skirmish with the B.C. Human Rights Tribunal.

In a complaint, Smith said members of other faiths — such as Sikhs — are allowed to wear headgear in licence photos.

“There is no test of faith that any government agency, including ICBC, can apply to judge whether or not a person earnestly believes what they profess when they ask to be photographed with a religious head covering,” Smith told the tribunal.

So, what relief did he seek?

“That ICBC allow qualified citizens who self-identify as Pastafarians, or as members of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, to wear religious headgear of a form and type of their choosing, insofar as such headgear does not interfere with (facial recognition technology), for the purposes of obtaining either, or both, a driver’s licence and a BC Services Card.”

However, the tribunal dismissed the complaint, saying Smith was not sincere.

“You are a Pastafarian and member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster which mocks religious beliefs and certain religious practices,” the March 2020 decision said. “Pastafarians wear colanders as ‘religious’ head gear.

“While the protection against discrimination on the ground of religion in the [Human Rights] Code includes protecting the expression of non-belief and the refusal to participate in religious practice, the protection does not require accommodation of a practice satirizing religious practice in providing a service customarily available to the public,” the decision said. “It would not further the purposes of the code to proceed with a complaint in these circumstances.”

Smith took that decision to court for a judicial review where, in 2021, Justice Gordon Weatherill noted Smith conceded some of his arguments were satirical.

Weatherill dismissed the review petition, saying the code had not been violated.

"Texas school shooting: 'Wrong decision' not to storm classroom where gunman was holed up killing children, official admits",https://news.sky.com/story/texas-school-shooting-wrong-decision-not-to-storm-school-where-gunman-was-holed-up-killing-children-official-admits-12622644,nottheonion,"It was the ""wrong decision"" not to storm the classroom where a gunman was holed up killing primary school children, a Texas official has admitted.

The extraordinary recognition came on Friday at a highly-charged news conference in Uvalde, Texas, where parents have been demanding answers about why 19 students and two teachers lost their lives in the deadly rampage on Tuesday.

Some reports said it was up to an hour before a special Border Patrol team killed the gunman. Parents had to be restrained outside, desperately wanting to enter the school themselves to take action.

Texas Department of Public Safety Director Steven McCraw admitted to journalists there had been a mistake.

He said the on-scene commander had judged the situation at the Robb Elementary School as ""no longer an active shooter situation"" and that they were instead dealing with ""a barricaded subject"".

However, he added: ""Obviously there were children in that classroom that were at risk and it was, in fact, still an active shooter situation.

""From the benefit of hindsight, of course, it was not the right decision, it was the wrong decision.""

Revealed: The full timeline of the police response

'Not here to defend what happened'

At the news conference, he revealed people outside could hear ""children begging for help"" inside the school building.

One journalist demanded to know if Mr McCraw - who at times appeared to be choked - had any words for the grieving parents.

He replied: ""What do I have to say to the parents? I don't have anything to say to the parents, other than what has happened.

""We are not here to defend what happened. We are here to report the facts.""

One reporter pushed further, and asked if the parents were owed an apology, because not everything was done that could have been.

""If I thought it would help, I would apologise,"" said Mr McCraw.

""When you go back to the timeline - I am not defending anything - but when you go back to the timeline there was a barrage of hundreds of rounds pumped in in four minutes in those two classrooms.

""Any firing afterwards was sporadic, it was at the door.

""So the belief is that there may not be anybody living anymore and the subject is now trying to keep enforcement at bay.""

Texas governor Greg Abbott said he was ""livid"" as he believed he had been ""misled"" by police over details of the response.

""I was on this very stage two days ago and I was telling the public information that had been told to me in a room just a few yards behind what we are looking at now.""

But on Friday he said the information he was given ""turned out in part to be inaccurate"" and said it was ""inexcusable"" the families may have suffered because of this.

What social media posts tell us about Ramos

Highschool dropout Salvador Ramos went on his murderous rampage after hinting to followers on his Instagram page that he might do something.

Mr McCraw said investigations had revealed a conversation in the days leading up to the shooting that read:

""Word on the street is that you are buying a gun.""

""I just bought something. It's far end.""

Then came this mysterious post:

""Ten more days"".

In response, someone had replied: ""You gonna shoot up the school or something?""

Ramos replied: ""No, stop asking dumb questions - and you'll see.""

Mr McCraw also revealed 1,657 rounds and 60 magazines had been found at the school after the atrocity.

'Laws don't stop madmen'

In a pre-recorded message to the National Rifle Association convention which went ahead in Houston, Texas, just three days after the shootings, Governor Abbott addressed growing calls for new anti-gun legislation in the US.

He said: ""Laws have not stopped madmen from carrying out evil acts on innocent people, peaceful communities,"" adding there are ""thousands of laws on the books across the country that limit owning or using a firearm"".

He concluded: ""Just as laws didn't stop the killer... we will not let his evils acts stop us."""
Kentucky Noah's Ark sues insurance company over damage caused by heavy rains,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kentucky-noahs-ark-encounter-sues-insurance-company-over-heavy-rain-damage/,nottheonion,"Williamstown, Ky. — In the Bible, the ark survived an epic flood. Yet the owners of Kentucky's Noah's ark attraction are demanding their insurance company bail them out after heavy rains caused nearly $1 million in property damage.



The Ark Encounter says in a federal lawsuit that rains in 2017 and 2018 caused a landslide on its access road. The lawsuit says the road has been rebuilt. The ark was not damaged.

The Courier Journal reports the attraction's insurance carriers refused to cover the damage, however.

The 510-foot-long wooden ark has been a popular northern Kentucky attraction since its 2016 opening. Answers in Genesis, the company that operates the Ark Encounter, also operates the Creation Museum in Petersburg, which opened its doors in 2007.

The suit names Allied World Assurance Co. Holdings of Switzerland, its use company and three other insurance carriers.



Ark Encounter seeks compensatory and punitive damages. The Swiss company hasn't responded in court filings."
Texas police never checked to see if the classroom door was locked during the Uvalde school shooting: DPS,https://www.insider.com/police-never-checked-classroom-door-locked-during-uvalde-shooting-dps-2022-6,nottheonion,"Police never checked to see if the classroom door was locked during the Uvalde, Texas, school shooting, a state official said.

Col. Steve McCraw, the director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, said the door was ""unsecured.""

Authorities wasted time waiting for a key to the door that was not needed, McCraw said.

Police who responded to the Uvalde, Texas, deadly school shooting never checked to see if the door to the classroom where the gunman carried out the rampage was locked, even as authorities wasted time waiting for a key, a top state law enforcement official said on Tuesday.

Col. Steve McCraw, the director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, described the door to the Robb Elementary School classroom where a shooter killed 19 children and two teachers last month as ""unsecured"" in testimony before a Texas State Senate committee investigating the May 24 mass shooting.

""I don't believe based on the information we have right now that that door was ever secured,"" McCraw said, explaining that the door was not able to be locked from the inside. ""In fact, I have great reason to believe it wasn't secured.""

""There's no way to lock the door from the inside and there's no way for the subject to lock the door from the inside,"" he said.

McCraw called it ""ridiculous"" and ""inexcusable"" in terms of security purposes for the door to have only been able to lock from the outside.

He added: ""The door was unsecured and we've gone back and checked in our interviews and did anybody touch the door, and try it?""

""How about trying the door, and seeing if it's unlocked … and of course, no one had,"" McCraw said.

McCraw said that based on reviews of police body-camera footage, ""​​We could never see anybody put their hand on the door up until the breach.""

The 18-year-old gunman entered the school building at 11:33 a.m, but it wasn't until 12:50 p.m. that authorities breached the classroom door and shot and killed the shooter.

It took 74 minutes for officers to go into the classroom where the gunman went on the shooting spree and stop him, even though students trapped inside repeatedly called 911 for help.

McCraw said that even if the classroom door was locked, authorities could have found another way inside.

""You didn't need a key, there's tools,"" McCraw said, adding, ""You don't have to wait for a key and shouldn't ever have to wait for a key to breach.""

""If you're there on the scene you have an obligation to immediately engage the shooter and stop the shooting,"" said McCraw. ""That's preached, practiced and required in the state of Texas. It just wasn't implemented.""

A newly released timeline from the Texas Department of Public Safety shows how embattled school district police chief Pete Arredondo — who has been identified by the agency as the on-scene commander during the shooting — begged for a key to open the classroom door.

According to the timeline, Arredondo requested a master key at 12:11 p.m. as dozens of officers from multiple agencies converged on the school.

At 12:16 p.m., Arredondo said, ""I just need a key"" and about a minute later, he told others cops, ""Tell them to fucking wait. No one comes in,"" according to a transcript of officers' body camera footage.

""There is a window over there obviously. The door is probably going to be locked. That is the nature of this place. I am going to get more keys to test,"" Arredondo said at 12:28 p.m., according to the transcript.

Seconds later, Arredondo said, ""These master keys aren't working here, bro. We have master keys and they're not working,"" the transcript shows.

Two minutes later, Arredondo added, ""We're ready to breach but that door is locked,"" according to the transcript.

""I say we breach through those windows and shoot his fucking head off through the windows,"" Arredondo said three minutes later, the transcript says.

According to the timeline released by DPS, a ""hooligan"" breaching tool arrived at the school at 12:35 p.m., but it does not appear that it was ever used.

""We're having a fucking problem getting into the room because it is locked. He's [the gunman] got an AR-15 and he's shooting everywhere like crazy. So, he's stopped,"" Arredondo said at 12:42 p.m., according to the transcript.

One minute later, Arredondo said, ""They gotta get that fucking door open, bro. They can't get that door open. We need more keys or something,"" the transcript shows.

During his testimony on Tuesday, McCraw slammed the police response to the school shooting as an ""abject failure.""

McCraw said three minutes after the gunman entered the school, there was a ""sufficient number of armed officers wearing body armor to isolate, distract, and neutralize the subject.""

""I appear to be hypercritical of the on-scene commander and I don't mean to be, but the facts are the facts,"" McCraw said. ""Mistakes were made, it should have never happened that way."""
"Indiana Republican backtracks after saying teachers should be 'impartial' when teaching about Nazism, fascism",https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/588983-indiana-republican-backtracks-after-saying-teachers-should-be-impartial,nottheonion,"An Indiana Republican who last week said teachers should be “impartial” when teaching about Nazism and fascism is now backtracking from his comments.

State Sen. Scott Baldwin (R), during a state Senate committee hearing on Wednesday regarding a proposed bill that would prohibit “divisive concepts” in schools, said educators have gone “too far” when taking a position on Marxism, Nazism and fascism, arguing that they “need to be impartial.”

“Marxism, Nazism, fascism … I have no problem with the education system providing instruction on the existence of those ‘isms,’” said Baldwin, a co-writer of the bill, according to The Washington Post.

“I believe that we’ve gone too far when we take a position. … We need to be impartial,” he added.

One day later, however, Baldwin walked back his comments in an email to the Indianapolis Star. He said he meant to express that educators should not be telling children what to think about politics.

“When I was drafting this bill, my intent with regard to ‘political affiliation’ was to cover political parties within the legal American political system,” Baldwin told the newspaper.

“In my comments during committee, I was thinking more about the big picture and trying to say that we should not tell kids what to think about politics,” he added.

Baldwin’s initial remarks last week came in response to concerns a high school teacher expressed regarding Senate Bill 167, the legislation up for consideration that is similar to bills taken up in a number of states prohibiting critical race theory, according to the Post.

The legislation would also compel schools to create committees so parents can analyze curricula and offer their thoughts on materials before they are used in the classroom.

The Anti-Defamation League said “Baldwin’s apology doesn’t change the deep harms of using ‘impartiality’ or ‘neutrality’ as tools to sanitize history,” adding, “There’s nothing neutral about Nazism.”

“This is part of the continued efforts by some to try and rewrite history and characterize extremism, racism, and genocide as somehow legitimate. This is dangerous and despicable. It should be categorically, universally, and loudly rejected,” the group added.

"AI wins state fair art contest, annoys humans",https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/08/ai-wins-state-fair-art-contest-annoys-humans/,nottheonion,"A synthetic media artist named Jason Allen entered AI-generated artwork into the Colorado State Fair fine arts competition and announced last week that he won first place in the Digital Arts/Digitally Manipulated Photography category, Vice reported Wednesday based on a viral tweet.

Allen used Midjourney—a commercial image synthesis model available through a Discord server—to create a series of three images. He then upscaled them, printed them on canvas, and submitted them to the competition in early August. To his delight, one of the images (titled Théåtre D'opéra Spatial) captured the top prize, and he posted about his victory on the Midjourney Discord server on Friday.

Allen's victory prompted lively discussions on Twitter, Reddit, and the Midjourney Discord server about the nature of art and what it means to be an artist. Some commenters think human artistry is doomed thanks to AI and that all artists are destined to be replaced by machines. Others think art will evolve and adapt with new technologies that come along, citing synthesizers in music. It's a hot debate that Wired covered in July.

There's also the fairness element since it isn't clear if Allen told the judges about his use of image synthesis, though some Twitter users have reportedly contacted the judges and discovered that they didn't know. Curiously, the art was considered good enough to fool human artists, and someone on Twitter joked that it settled the debate over ""whether AI art is art.""

It's worth noting that the invention of the camera in the 1800s prompted similar criticism related to the medium of photography, since the camera seemingly did all the work compared to an artist that labored to craft an artwork by hand with a brush or pencil. Some feared that painters would forever become obsolete with the advent of color photography. In some applications, photography replaced more laborious illustration methods (such as engraving), but human fine art painters are still around today.

Image synthesis tools in their current state require a high degree of human guidance and cherry-picking to achieve remarkable results, but the field is evolving rapidly, and that might not always be the case. Still, as long as new artistic tools emerge, the ""Is it art?"" debate will likely continue as long as there are people to have the discussion."
"Florida bride allegedly laces wedding food with pot, grins as deputies arrive, bodycam shows",https://www.foxnews.com/us/florida-bride-marijuana-laced-catering-bodycam,nottheonion,"Florida deputies' bodycam video shows a grinning new bride as law enforcement responded to reports of a mass marijuana overdose at her wedding after she and the caterer allegedly engaged in lacing their guest’s food with pot and causing multiple bad trips.

It shows deputies telling catering staff ""don’t put anything away yet"" after loading victims into the back of an ambulance.

""We all have been affected, somehow, by what was put in the food,"" a man, whose face is blurred, tells a Seminole County Sheriff’s deputy in video recorded at a Feb. 19 wedding and released Monday.

FLORIDA BRIDE AND CATERER ARRESTED AFTER WEDDING GUESTS GET SICK FROM WEED-LACED FOOD

""We’re trying to figure out who put it in the food, whether it was a guest or the catering company,"" the officer responds, before walking across the lawn to interview the bride and groom.

The bride, Dayna Glenny Svoboda, 42, and caterer, Joycelyn Bryant, 31, have been charged with tampering, culpable negligence and marijuana delivery. They did not respond to requests for comment Monday, nor did a lawyer listed for Bryant. It was not immediately clear who was representing Svoboda.

The bodycam video shows law enforcement confronting the bride and groom after their wedding went south.

""Supposedly your food had cannabis inside of it,"" a deputy can be heard telling the couple as the wedding singer is standing with them trying to get paid. ""Did you guys authorize that?""

""I have no idea,"" replies the husband, Andrew Svoboda, who has not been charged. His face appears blurred in the footage.

The bride is standing in the background, seemingly aloof with a smile on her face. The grin turns into a strained look and she shakes her head no as the deputy repeats his question.

At least 18 people complained of feeling high or ill after eating at the reception, according to court documents. There were between 50 and 70 guests present.

According to court documents, one victim, Miranda Cady, told investigators that she saw Bryant placing spoonfuls of what looked like a green herb mixture into olive oil for the bread. It smelled like pot, but lost its scent once mixed with the oil. She said she recognized the caterer from a prior event in January.

When she confronted Svoboda on the dance floor, the bride allegedly admitted to lacing the food and ""acted like [she] should be excited as if she were given a gift."" She also told investigators she was ""terrified"" at how the food made her feel and showed them a positive marijuana test.

All 10 people seated at her table discussed feeling the drug's effects the next day in a group text, she told investigators. Other alleged victims included a half-dozen relatives of the bride who had traveled in from Michigan and the newlyweds' neighbor.

One questionable dish the victims shared in common was the bread and olive oil appetizer.

Authorities later tested food dumped on a neighbor's lawn nearby and found traces of THC in the lasagna as well, the documents state.

Christopher Baumann, who lives near the wedding venue, told Fox News Digital Monday that his security cameras recorded an unidentified woman dumping trash on his property on the evening on the nuptials.

""We found what looked like some food leftover and stuff, it looked like a lot of dessert…salad, some kind of pasta, dumped in our front lawn,"" he said.

He said he was not sure who the woman was but that he did not believe her to be Svoboda or Bryant.

Baumann and his wife reached out to the homeowners association and were told to contact police. Police referenced their video in the warrants and said they tested some of the food and found THC, the active ingredient of marijuana, present.

The gated community, known as The Springs, was built in the 1970s and is rife with nature trails and wild animals, Baumann said. He has lived there for about two years and said this was the first trouble he’s seen stemming from a wedding at the clubhouse.

""It’s the first time I’ve ever heard of anything… this is not a neighborhood that has that kind of stuff going on,"" he said."
City of Houston sues to shut down Lucky Evening Food Store for not addressing crime in their area,https://abc13.com/houston-crime-lucky-evening-food-store-caught-in-south-braeswood/12024958/,nottheonion,"A convenience store that too often has been caught up in violent crime, finds itself in the middle of a battle over keeping Houston safe.

City of Houston sues to shut down corner store for not addressing crime in their area

HOUSTON, Texas (KTRK) -- The Lucky Evening Food Store in southwest Houston has been open for 20 years under the same owner.

""It has gotten progressively worse in terms of crime over the last few decades, but these people were committed to the community,"" Loyd Neal, the attorney representing the owner of the store, said.

In March, the store, located in the 8900 block of South Braeswood, and property owners were hit with a common nuisance lawsuit by the city.

The lawsuit read there have been repeated incidents of delivery and possession of controlled substances, robbery, aggravated robbery, aggravated assaults, unlawful carrying of a weapon, and murder at the property.

""They are being sued because they supposedly, knowingly tolerate crime at this property,"" Neal said.

When Mayor Sylvester Turner and Houston Police Chief Troy Finner announced the One Safe Houston initiative in February 2022, they vowed to file suit against businesses deemed as crime hot spots.

Neal and his client do not disagree that crime is bad in the area. In an exhibit filed in the case, they list the 720 incidents that happened within 1,000 feet of the food store from Jan. 1, 2020, to June 22, 2022. Employees have had their cars shot and there are bullet holes in the side of the building.

""I would argue that you can't go to the city and say that the employees of the convenience store can stop a bullet or should be liable for someone driving by and committing crimes and shooting people,"" Neal said.

The strip center is surrounded by apartment complexes and a homeless camp.

They have installed surveillance cameras, burglar bars, high-intensity lighting, and signage to prevent loiterers and trespassing affidavits, according to the store's attorney.

""They don't want that element present,"" Neal said. ""They want the city to come in and provide the police protection that they pay the taxes for and protect them.""

The store owner has realized that calling the police is actually detrimental to his business. With each call they make to police for help, they believe that it's another mark against them in the eyes of the city that has ultimately led to this lawsuit.

""You're like, wait a minute,"" Neal said. ""We are calling the police and reporting the criminals and then you are using that stat to presume our guilt under the statute that we aren't stopping crime?""

It has become a self-fulfilling problem in their eyes.

City Attorney Arturo Michel said they base who they file the Chapter 125 suits against in many ways on complaints.

""We rely on information from HPD and we rely on the body of case law that looks at what level of instances, and whether the owners have done anything to remediate,"" Michel said. ""It's on a case-by-case basis. It's not an exact objective determination. There is a lot of subjectivity that goes into it, but we have an entire section of the legal department that looks at that continuously.""

The state statute allows the attorney general's office, district, counties, cities, or individuals to bring the suits against ""a person who maintains a place to which persons habitually go for the following purposes and who knowingly tolerates the activity and furthermore fails to make reasonable attempts to abate the activity maintains a common nuisance."" The statute goes on to list more than two dozen crimes.

The city is seeking a temporary and permanent injunctive order against the store and property to stop allowing crime.

""One of the penalties is the city can come in and turn off your utilities,"" Neal explained. ""The city can come in and revoke your certificate of occupancy. Another penalty is the city can force the landlord to come in and terminate your lease. One of them says if you violate the injunction, you can be put in jail.""

Neal has filed a challenge to the constitutionality of the state statute used in the suit. He said it violates both the Texas and U.S. constitutions, among several reasons, he said it is vague.

""This is a very significant legal issue right now,"" Neal said. ""What it's done is being used to aggressively pursue innocent tax-paying businesses and shift to them the responsibility to stop crime, but what is so unfair about it is not only are they at risk of losing their businesses and property and equipment and having their property shut down, but now innocent business owners are being asked to spend tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees to defend themselves.""

He said the statute was not meant to shut down tax-paying businesses that are not stopping criminals.

Based on what a judge rules on Neal's complaint, there could be statewide effects.

""Now if you shut down this convenience store, do you think you've stopped crime?"" Neal asked. ""No, you've just moved it down the street. It's done nothing but make the city look like they accomplished something by taking some action or maybe putting $10,000 in someone's pocket as a penalty.""

ABC13 reached out to the city to raise Neal and his client's concerns, and ask if they intended to pursue a suit against any high-crime apartment complexes in the city, but did not hear back.

The city also filed a nuisance lawsuit against Spivey's Uptown Nightclub.

""I think Spivey's in many ways, it does not look like TABC is going to grant them their liquor license and it may be folded all into that,"" Michel said.

A spokesperson for TABC told ABC13 that currently their liquor permit is expired and they are under an active investigation. Based on the outcome, they may not have it renewed.

The city also said they filed a TABC protest against Standard Bar on Washington Ave. TABC confirmed that they too are under investigation that should wrap up in the coming week. The outcome will determine their ability to hold a liquor permit.

""No Shit"", Says World.",https://www.luriechildrens.org/en/news-stories/teens-with-access-to-firearms-found-to-be-at-higher-risk-for-suicide/,nottheonion,"Teens with Access to Firearms Found to Be at Higher Risk for Suicide

Findings point to need to screen all adolescents for suicide risk and access to firearms

Adolescents who had access to firearms had about 1.5 times higher odds for prior suicide attempt and current suicidal ideation, according to a study published in the journal Academic Pediatrics. The study also found that one-third of adolescents coming to the Emergency Department (ED) for any reason had moderate to severe depressive symptoms, and over 40 percent of this group had access to a gun. This data was collected before the pandemic, during which EDs across the country saw an overwhelming increase in mental health burden in youth.

“Our findings underscore the importance of screening all adolescents who present to the ED for suicide risk and access to firearms,” said lead author Samaa Kemal, MD, MPH, Pediatric Emergency Medicine Fellow at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago. “This is even more critical now that we are in the midst of a youth mental health crisis.”

Currently, the Joint Commission mandates that all children over 12 years old should be screened for suicide risk, and if this risk is identified, screening for access to lethal means is recommended. However, screening for firearm access tends to be inconsistent in the ED.

Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents in the United States, and adolescent suicide death rates have almost doubled over the past 10 years. Firearms accounted for 44 percent of suicide deaths among adolescents ages 14 to 18 between 2015 and 2020, with an estimated 70 percent of firearm-related suicide attempts involving weapons that were obtained within the victim’s household.

Dr. Kemal and colleagues analyzed data from over 15,000 patients ages 14-18 years seen at a tertiary children’s hospital ED between June 2013 and March 2020. Fourteen percent of the overall sample reported access to a firearm in the home or ability to access one within the next 24 hours. A history of sexual assault significantly increased the odds of a participant reporting a prior suicide attempt. Participants reporting verbal bullying, intimate partner violence, and/or abuse by a caregiver also had significantly increased odds of reporting current suicidal ideation and prior suicide attempt.

“Universal mental health screening of adolescents is particularly important in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to both increased firearm availability and worsening indicators of youth mental health,” said Dr. Kemal. “Proper screening for both suicidality and firearm access can create the opportunity to offer effective firearm safety counseling, such as keeping all firearms locked, unloaded and separate from ammunition, as well as linkage to mental health resources. We must do everything possible to prevent tragic deaths among teens who are struggling.”

NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) this week captured an image of the sun in ultraviolet light featuring three dark patches that look like a smiling face — a face that could signal a solar storm with problems for Earth.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Weather Prediction Center issued a minor geomagnetic storm watch effective for Saturday. While geomagnetic storms can create beautiful aurora in the sky, they can also disrupt GPS and create harmful currents in the power grid and pipelines.

The dark patches, known as coronal holes, are regions where solar wind escapes more quickly and readily into space, making these regions cooler. These winds can clock up to 1.8 million miles per hour, according to Exploratorium, a museum in San Francisco.

People capitalized on the opportunity to make memes and alterations of the smiling sun to look like a jack-o'-lantern or the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man from the Ghostbusters franchise.

NASA took photos of the sun back in 2014 that also resembled a jack-o'-lantern, titling the photos ""Pumpkin Sun."" The regions that made up the jack-o'-lantern's face were active regions of the sun, marking disturbances in the magnetic field that produce solar storms like solar flares and coronal mass ejections.

Because the human eye cannot perceive certain wavelengths of the sunlight, solar physicists use telescopes that can image the sun in the extreme ultraviolet spectrum. SDO uses 13 different wavelengths of light to highlight a particular part of the sun's atmosphere.

""Ultraviolet light from the sun can show us the origins of solar storms that can lead to power outages, cell phone disruptions, and delays in shipping packages due to the rerouting of planes from over the pole,"" Joseph Gurman, a scientist at the Solar Data Analysis Center at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, told NASA.

Wednesday's image was taken at 193 angstrom light, giving it the yellow, light orange hue. The 2014 image was taken at a blend of 171 and 193 angstrom light, colorizing the sun in gold and yellow ""to create a Halloween-like appearance,"" according to NASA.

Both images were captured in October in time for the Halloween season."

‘Disturbing’: weedkiller ingredient tied to cancer found in 80% of US urine samples,https://www.buzz-news.com.co/?p=152,nottheonion,"CDC study finds glyphosate, controversial ingredient found in weedkillers including popular Roundup brand, present in samples

More than 80% of urine samples drawn from children and adults in a US health study contained a weedkilling chemical linked to cancer, a finding scientists have called “disturbing” and “concerning”.

The report by a unit of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that out of 2,310 urine samples, taken from a group of Americans intended to be representative of the US population, 1,885 were laced with detectable traces of glyphosate. This is the active ingredient in herbicides sold around the world, including the widely used Roundup brand. Almost a third of the participants were children ranging from six to 18.

Academics and private researchers have been noting high levels of the herbicide glyphosate in analyses of human urine samples for years. But the CDC has only recently started examining the extent of human exposure to glyphosate in the US, and its work comes at a time of mounting concerns and controversy over how pesticides in food and water impact human and environmental health.

“I expect that the realization that most of us have glyphosate in our urine will be disturbing to many people,” said Lianne Sheppard, professor at the University of Washington’s department of environmental and occupational health sciences. Thanks to the new research, “we know that a large fraction of the population has it in urine. Many people will be thinking about whether that includes them.”

Sheppard co-authored a 2019 analysis that found glyphosate exposure increases the risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and also co-authored a 2019 scientific paper that reviewed 19 studies documenting glyphosate in human urine.

Both the amount and prevalence of glyphosate found in human urine has been rising steadily since the 1990s when Monsanto Co. introduced genetically engineered crops designed to be sprayed directly with Roundup, according to research published in 2017 by University of California San Diego School of Medicine researchers.

Paul Mills, the lead researcher of that study, said at the time there was “an urgent need” for a thorough examination of the impact on human health from glyphosate in foods people commonly consume.

More than 200 million pounds of glyphosate are used annually by US farmers on their fields. The weedkiller is sprayed directly over genetically engineered crops such as corn and soybeans, and also over non-genetically engineered crops such as wheat and oats as a desiccant to dry crops out prior to harvest. Many farmers also use it on fields before the growing season, including spinach growers and almond producers. It is considered the most widely used herbicide in history.

Residues of glyphosate have been documented in an array of popular foods made with crops sprayed with glyphosate, including baby food. The primary route of exposure for children is through the diet.

Monsanto and the company that bought it in 2018, Bayer, have maintained that glyphosate and Roundup products are safe, and that residues in food and in human urine are not a health risk.

They are at odds with many researchers and the International Agency for Research on Cancer, a unit of the World Health Organization, which classified glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen in 2015.

The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has taken the opposite stance, classifying glyphosate as not likely to be carcinogenic. But last month a federal appeals court issued an opinion vacating the agency’s safety determination and ordering the agency to give “further consideration” to evidence of glyphosate risks.

“People of all ages should be concerned, but I’m particularly concerned for children,” said Phil Landrigan, who worked for years at the CDC and the EPA and now directs the Program for Global Public Health and the Common Good at Boston College.

“Children are more heavily exposed to pesticides than adults because pound-for-pound they drink more water, eat more food and breathe more air,” Landrigan said. “Also, children have many years of future life when they can develop diseases with long incubation periods such as cancer. This is particularly a concern with the herbicide, glyphosate.”

The new CDC data was released as part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), research that is typically highly valued by scientists.

Cynthia Curl, Boise State University assistant professor of community and environmental health, said it was “obviously concerning” that a large percentage of the US population is exposed to glyphosate, but said it is still unclear how that translates to human health.

Mom who faked her own kidnapping and went to Disney World is now facing fraud charges,https://www.inquirer.com/news/bonnie-sweeten-kidnap-hoax-mom-fraud-20221017.html,nottheonion,"A former Bucks County woman who sparked national outrage 13 years ago by falsely claiming she had been kidnapped when she had actually gone to Walt Disney World is back in trouble with the law.

Bonnie Sweeten, once called a “master con woman” by a federal judge, has been charged in connection with a scheme to steal from an employer who was trying to give her a second chance, U.S. Attorney Jacqueline C. Romero announced Monday.

Sweeten, 51, recently of Delanco, Burlington County, was charged by information, which means she may have agreed to a plea deal, with two counts of wire fraud related to allegedly stealing from a Doylestown-based excavating company, Romero said in a news release.

If convicted, she faces a maximum of 40 years in prison, Romero said.

According to Romero, Sweeten was hired as a bookkeeper in September 2017 because the president of the company had known her for many years.

Sweeten allegedly issued dozens of unauthorized company checks to herself; stole checks that had been mailed to the company, which she then fraudulently endorsed over to herself; and used a company credit card to make tens of thousands of dollars of personal purchases, Romero said.

In the 2009 kidnapping hoax case, Sweeten called 911 and claimed to have been carjacked along with her 9-year-old daughter. Sweeten, who is white, said that two Black men had rear-ended her SUV in Lower Bucks County and abducted the girl and her.

Sweeten told the dispatcher that she was calling from the trunk of the kidnappers’ Cadillac, triggering a massive police dragnet.

Sweeten and her daughter turned up the next day at a luxury resort at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla. She had used the driver’s license of a former coworker to purchase plane tickets from Philadelphia the day she fled.

For the hoax, Sweeten was sentenced to at least nine months in county prison.

In 2012, Sweeten was sentenced to 100 months in federal prison for a series of deceptions starting in 2004 to steal more than $1 million while working as a paralegal in Bucks County."
Black correction officer mistaken for shoplifter sues Walmart for 'racial profiling',https://abcnews.go.com/US/black-correction-officer-mistaken-shoplifter-sues-walmart-racial/story?id=82460745,nottheonion,"A Black law enforcement officer is alleging that he was racially profiled in a Georgia Walmart store after he was handcuffed and wrongfully accused of shoplifting -- and now he's suing.

David Conners, a Clayton County corrections officer, said he was shopping for home decor when a Fayetteville Police Department officer stopped him in his tracks, saying employees believed he was a man with the last name ""Wright"" who had repeatedly stolen electronics from the store.

""He's just in the store, minding his own business, when he's approached by the police, and everything went downhill from there,"" Terance Madden, an attorney for Conners, told ABC News in an interview.

The Walmart Supercenter in Fayetteville, Ga. is pictured in an image from Google Maps Street view on Nov. 2021. Google Maps Street view

According to the lawsuit, officers handcuffed him while investigating claims by Walmart employees that he was the serial shoplifter. Madden said a warrant already had been issued for that individual.

Conners gave the arresting officers two pieces of identification -- one of which showed he was a local correction officer -- but he was still taken to another room and held while officers investigated, the lawsuit said.

Officers showed Conners footage of the shoplifter that employees thought was him. Conners pointed out that he has visible tattoos, while the alleged shoplifter didn't. But it wasn't until officers called someone familiar with the case who confirmed Conners wasn't the shoplifter that he was released, according to the lawsuit.

In a statement to ABC News, Walmart spokesperson Randy Hargrove said: ""We don't tolerate discrimination of any kind and take allegations like this seriously. We are not going to comment further on this pending litigation.""

Conners said he's since sought professional counseling to cope with the mental and psychological trauma that he says was brought about as a result of this incident. He said neither Walmart nor the employee who called the police has apologized for the incident.

Conners also said the incident has given him a new perspective on the prevalence and impact of racial profiling, as a law enforcement officer himself.

""You see it all the time, but you never believe it's going to happen to you until it happens to you,"" Madden added. ""It becomes personal, and a violation is something you can't help to think about over and over and over again when it happens to you."""

A FedEx worker accidentally delivered six rifles intended for a private collector to Chester High School on Friday, according to Chester police.

The delivery — six boxes containing .30-caliber M1 rifles — was dropped off Friday afternoon, Chester Police Commissioner Steven Gretsky said. Within minutes, the driver realized his mistake and contacted police, who were able to pick the guns up Monday and give them to their intended recipient.

“It really was just an honest mistake; the addresses are very similar,” Gretsky said. “Everything was legitimate, and no charges are going to be filed.”

Gretsky said the guns had been ordered by a collector who owns an auto-repair shop in Chester Township, which borders the city.

Community members learned of the error Monday evening, when Chester Upland School District Superintendent Craig Parkinson sent a letter to parents outlining the issue. Classes are scheduled to resume in the 2,621-student district Monday.

Parkinson said the boxes were delivered to the school’s loading dock and secured inside the building over the weekend, the standard practice for any delivery. The boxes did not appear to be suspicious, Parkinson said.

“We wanted to communicate with you about this in case you hear rumors in the community or on social media,” Parkinson said in the letter. “We are focused on a positive start to the school year and can’t wait to see you and our students back in our schools!”

A spokesperson for FedEx said in an email Wednesday that the company is cooperating with Chester police and is conducting an internal review of the situation."

Republican States Sue to Let Schools Block LGBTQ Children From Getting Meals,https://truthout.org/articles/republican-states-sue-to-let-schools-block-lgbtq-children-from-getting-meals/,nottheonion,"The lawsuit is part of the right’s escalating attacks on LGBTQ peoples’ right to exist in the U.S.

In the latest installment of Republicans’ cultural and legal war against LGBTQ adults and children, the vast majority of the U.S.’s Republican attorneys general filed a lawsuit last week suing the Biden administration over its Department of Agriculture (USDA) rule aimed at preventing LGBTQ children from being discriminated against in school meal programs.

Twenty-two Republican attorneys general, including from states with explicitly far-right GOP leadership like Texas, are suing over a rule announced by the USDA earlier this year that prohibits schools from receiving federal meal funding if they have meal programs that discriminate against LGBTQ children. About 95 percent of public schools receive federal funding for meals. The rule is based off of anti-discrimination rules laid out in Title IX.

Their argument — that the USDA doesn’t have the authority to make such anti-discrimination rules — is similar to what a Tennessee judge found of federal protections for LGBTQ people in school and the workplace last month.

However, the underlying reason that the attorneys general are bringing the lawsuit is to advance their mission of subjugating and punishing LGBTQ children and adults for existing. Indiana’s Republican Attorney General Todd Rokita, one of the leaders of the lawsuit, said in a loaded statement announcing the lawsuit that “the Biden administration is dead-set on imposing an extreme left-wing agenda” and added that the anti-discrimination rule is a form of left-wing authoritarianism.

Of course, the real threat of authoritarianism in the U.S. is coming from the right, which is coordinating to rig elections for the GOP and has spent the last years enshrining cruel anti-LGBTQ ideologies into their official party platforms and passing laws establishing legal bases to discriminate against trans youth, unleashing violence against the LGBTQ community.

Advocates for the National School Lunch program, which helps to feed tens of millions of children each year, have long held that the program is necessary to reduce poverty and improve health outcomes for children who may not be able to access meals otherwise. The USDA anti-discrimination rule was announced as part of a Biden administration initiative to prevent discrimination against LGBTQ children in schools.

Republicans have spent decades trying to make cuts to school meals; earlier this year, thanks in part to Republican leaders in Congress, legislators failed to extend a universal school lunch program that has fed an estimated 10 million children through the pandemic.

The party, which has been lurching further and further into right-wing extremism, has launched a deluge of escalating attacks against LGBTQ people in recent years. Earlier this year, after Republican legislators banned trans children from participating in school sports and hurled hateful and false child abuse allegations against parents of LGBTQ children, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced that his administration was moving to ban trans children and Medicaid recipients from receiving gender affirming care — care that evidence shows can often be life-saving.

In another recent lawsuit, a prominent Texas Republican who had a major hand in crafting the state’s restrictive abortion ban argued that allowing people to access HIV medications for free under the Affordable Care Act was a violation of his Christian clients’ rights to maintain their homophobia.

Borrowers in 7 states may be taxed on their student loan cancellation,https://www.npr.org/2022/09/09/1121717824/biden-student-loans-debt-cancellation-taxpayer-impact,nottheonion,"Borrowers in 7 states may be taxed on their student loan cancellation

Enlarge this image Sesame/Getty Images Sesame/Getty Images

When federal student loan borrowers take a breath from celebrating the cancelation of some or all of their federal student loans, millions of them could be in for a nasty surprise:

While President Biden's sweeping student debt relief won't be subject to federal income tax, in seven states borrowers may have to pay state income tax on all those canceled loans.

Before 2021, student debt cancelation was generally considered a form of income, and therefore taxable both at the federal and usually state level. But in March of 2021, the American Rescue Plan changed that, at least temporarily: Until the end of 2025, Congress said, the U.S. government will not consider canceled student loan debts to be taxable income.

Now that the Biden administration has unveiled its sweeping new debt cancelation plan, this federal exemption is a really big deal. That's because most places follow the federal government's lead when it comes to income tax.

""The majority of states that have an income tax essentially say, 'Whatever the federal government says is gross income, we say the same thing,' "" explains John Brooks, a Fordham University professor who studies both tax policy and student loan law.

But seven states are out of step with federal tax policy and have either said they will tax debt relief or still have policies that could require it, barring a change in state law.

States where borrowers may be taxed for loan cancellation

1. North Carolina

Like most states, North Carolina conforms to federal tax law. What's interesting here is that the state decided, in spite of Congress, to tax student debt relief.

In a statement, the North Carolina Department of Revenue tells NPR the state's General Assembly chose not to adopt the federal student debt tax exemption. ""The Department is monitoring any further enactments by the General Assembly that could change the taxability of student loan forgiveness in North Carolina,"" a spokesperson says.

But for now, it's taxable. And the Assembly has given no indication it will change that.

2. Indiana

Like North Carolina, Indiana tends to follow federal tax policy, but has similarly chosen to break with Congress on this. Tax officials there have confirmed (to the AP) that residents will be expected to list any debt relief they receive under taxable income.

3. Mississippi

Now things get more complicated. Unlike most states, Mississippi doesn't follow federal tax policy, so the changes in the American Rescue Plan don't mean much there. That's no guarantee they will ultimately tax debt relief; it just means that, right now, there's nothing on the state's books to exempt canceled loans.

As such, Mississippi's Department of Revenue has reportedly confirmed that under current state law, student debt relief is taxable.

4. Arkansas

Like Mississippi, Arkansas' tax policies don't follow federal policy, so, again, there's no obvious exemption on the books there to protect debt relief from being taxed. But... Arkansas has not yet said it will tax these canceled loans.

In an email to NPR, a spokesperson for the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration says, ""Our Department is currently reviewing whether debt forgiveness in this scenario is subject to state income tax in Arkansas. If we determine this is indeed subject to state income tax, legislative action would be required to change/exempt it. The next session of the Arkansas General Assembly is scheduled to begin in early 2023.""

5. Minnesota

Now the murky gets even murkier. While most states mirror federal tax policy, some are simply out-of-date, like Minnesota. It conforms to federal policy that pre-dates the American Rescue Plan, going back to 2018, when debt relief was still considered taxable.

The fact that Minnesota could technically tax debt relief is not an intentional response to the news, says Jared Walczak of the Tax Foundation. Walczak advises state leaders on tax policy and has been paying close attention to this income tax conundrum.

""They did not go through with this saying, 'Well, if President Biden makes this policy enactment, we are going to tax this.' This is just the continuation of existing law. It's where pretty much every state would have been a year ago.""

But most states have updated their policies, Walczak says. Minnesota and a handful of other states, ""because of the quirks of their tax codes, have not. That is something they could potentially fix.""

Minnesota's Democratic governor tried to fix it, introducing a tax bill during the last legislative session that would have brought the state up-to-date, ""however, that legislation was not passed so Minnesota is currently out of conformity with federal law in that area,"" a spokesperson for the Minnesota Department of Revenue writes in an email to NPR.

""If the state does not conform to this federal law, then Minnesota taxpayers who have their student debt discharged will have to add back this amount for Minnesota income tax purposes.""

6. Wisconsin

Like Minnesota, Wisconsin also conforms to outdated federal tax policy, in this case from 2020, just a few months before the ARPA exempted student debt relief.

""It hasn't updated it since then,"" says Brooks at Fordham University, ""which is not to say that they don't want to. It just doesn't seem to be an immediate priority right now in their legislative calendar."" Brooks says that's in part because the federal debt relief action is still brand new.

Both Minnesota and Wisconsin could still update their state tax policies and choose to exempt student debt relief. Though any changes would need to happen by early 2023, before tax season, or last-minute tweaks could lead to widespread confusion.

7. California

Believe it or not, it's possible this Democratic stronghold could find itself having to tax millions of Californians who qualify for Biden's debt relief plan – because the state conforms to federal tax policy from 2015, according to the Tax Foundation. It does have tax exclusions on the books for some specific kinds of debt relief, like loans canceled through an income-based repayment plan, but, depending on whom you ask, it's either unclear or unlikely that those can be applied to Biden's recent announcement.

In an email to NPR, a spokesperson for the California Franchise Tax Board says they can't yet say if debt relief in California will be taxable because they need more information from the U.S. Department of Education. ""We are saying the loan forgiveness (i.e., cancellation of indebtedness) would be taxable in California UNLESS this federal student loan debt is repaid or canceled pursuant to 1098e of Title 20 of the United States Code.""

Secret decoder ring: That section of the tax code refers to debts discharged through income-based repayment plans. And, says Walczak, ""I can't imagine any scenario in which [debt under the Biden plan] would be forgiven under those sections.""

In other words, California leaders will likely need to take some additional action if they don't want the state taxing millions of student loan borrowers there. And action seems highly likely, with leaders of the state legislature tweeting on Friday, ""Rest assured, one way or another, California will not tax the federal student debt relief.""

How much income tax borrowers may have to pay

President Biden's loan forgiveness plan would cancel up to $10,000 in debt for individuals who earn less than $125,000 a year, or less than $250,000 a year for couples; and it would cancel up to $20,000 for borrowers who received a Pell Grant in college and meet those income requirements.

Assuming a hypothetical state income tax rate of 5%, a borrower who receives $10,000 in debt cancellation would be on the hook for $500 in state income tax, and a borrower who receives the Pell-eligible $20,000 in relief could have to pay as much as $1,000 to the state.

That may be a high bar for some borrowers. After all, this relief is a debt reset; it's not a windfall of dollars that can then be used to pay off an unexpected tax liability.

""A lot of people anticipate some amount of return and really depend on that at the end of the year to get that money back. So if that gets wiped out, I could see that really disrupting people's financial planning,"" says Colin Stroud, who lives in Madison, Wisc., and says he qualifies for $10,000 in debt cancellation.

Stroud says, while he can afford the added tax bill if it comes to that, ""I just don't understand why you would want to spring this on people. I don't know what is gained by it.""

Also, while we're talking about only a handful of states, this is not only a handful of borrowers.

According to federal data from March 2022, almost 8 million federal student loan borrowers live in just these seven states, and the vast majority likely qualify for debt relief.

What borrowers should know about filing their taxes

There's one more reason this muddle could cause yet more confusion come tax time:

The U.S. government has instructed student loan servicing companies not to mail a federal 1099-C form to the millions of borrowers who receive debt relief. This matters, a lot.

In the past, the 1099-C form has been sent not only to borrowers who receive debt relief, notifying them of their tax burden, but also to state tax authorities.

This year, though, because debt relief is not considered taxable income at the federal level, the U.S. government won't be sending out 1099-C forms. That's because if 40 million borrowers receive a form suggesting they owe federal income tax on their debt relief, when they don't, ""that would confuse the heck out of a lot of taxpayers,"" Brooks says.

But without this 1099-C form, it's state tax authorities who'll be confused.

States that want to collect income tax on these canceled student debts won't have a clear way of knowing who got help and who didn't. Tax preparers and tax preparation software can ask borrowers if they received debt relief, and borrowers will have a legal responsibility to answer truthfully, but, without that 1099-C, states will have to rely on the word of borrowers.

Brooks and Walczak both say many borrowers might not report their debt relief as income – not because they're trying to commit fraud but because it simply wouldn't occur to them that it would be taxable, since they're not being asked to pay federal income taxes.

""This is difficult. This is new. People aren't necessarily expecting it, and especially if you don't have documentation being sent to you like you would with just about any other form of debt discharge. It's putting people at a disadvantage,"" Walczak says.

""If borrowers don't report it,"" Brooks says, ""the state tax agencies don't know that there was cancellation. Everybody just moves on, and it doesn't actually get taxed at the state level in a practical sense, even if the state law says that it should be.""

Brooks and Walczak recommend borrowers in these states stay tuned.

It's possible, perhaps even likely, that, given these complications, one or more of these states will update their tax policies in the coming months and follow Congress' lead after all."

Royal beekeeper has to inform palace bees that the Queen has died in strange ritual,https://www.edinburghlive.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/royal-beekeeper-inform-palace-bees-24986089,nottheonion,"The royal beekeeper has taken part in a peculiar ancient tradition by telling bees that the Queen has died.

It is understood that the bees were informed of the change from Elizabeth II to Charles III through whispered tones.

The stinging news was shared with the bees at their hive homes on the grounds of Buckingham Palace and Clarence House.

John Chapple, who is the official palace beekeeper, had to make the solemn journey to the hive locations on Friday September 9 to inform the insects of the Queen’s passing, the Mirror reports.

The bees showed their respect by having black ribbons tied in bows on the outside of their hives where thousands of the honey collecting beasties live.

The ritual took place through the 79-year-old informing the bees that the Queen had died and they would have a new master.

Afterwards the bees were urged to be good to their new boss King Charles.

This strange and quirky ancient superstition is said to have become common practice after it was believed that keeping the bees out of the loop would lead to them not being able to produce honey, abandoning the hive or dying.

Mr Chapple told MailOnline : ""I’m at the hives now and it is traditional when someone dies that you go to the hives and say a little prayer and put a black ribbon on the hive.

""I drape the hives with black ribbon with a bow.

""The person who has died is the master or mistress of the hives, someone important in the family who dies and you don’t get any more important than the Queen, do you?

""You knock on each hive and say, ‘The mistress is dead, but don't you go. Your master will be a good master to you.""

Mr Chapple looks after more than a million bees in total but has seen the numbers drop as late summer comes to an end.

It is understood that Clarence house is home to two hives whilst Buckingham Palace has five.

It is estimated that there are only 20,000 insects at the sites at the present moment but during the height of summer their ranks can swell to beyond one million.

The royal beekeeper has been in his role for 15 years and admitted that he did not realise that informing the bees was part of his role.

But he was alerted to his duty after receiving an email from the head gardener who told him to speak with the bees and let them know of the development.

The 79-year-old who is retired, says his hobby is beekeeping and he also tends the hives of other important people.

But he said his first duty was to the Queen who he was employed by 15 years and hopes it will continue with King Charles III.

Mr Chapple has been been looking after bees for more than three decades and this began because of his wife’s love of honey.

The hobby has taken him around the world where he has met wonderful people and observed sights only beekeepers get to see.

He said it had been a 'wonderful privilege' to work for the Queen and hopes his work will continue with King Charles.

The bees in his care are Dark European Honey bees, but some of them he says are London mongrels.

Other European countries also have similar traditions to tell the insects about their keeper's lives.

In some cases if the custom was omitted it was believed a penalty would occur for the owner including the end of their honey production or the death of the bees.

CEO who is outspoken about free speech fires at least five employees for writing a letter to other executives calling him an embarrassment,https://www.space.com/elon-musk-embarrassing-spacex-employee-letter,nottheonion,"SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk and the SpaceX team are recognized by Vice President Mike Pence at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center following the launch of the company’s Demo-2 mission to the International Space Station.

A group of anonymous SpaceX employees say that founder and CEO Elon Musk's recent behavior reflects badly on the company.

An open letter to company executives was posted in an internal SpaceX Microsoft Teams channel with more than 2,600 employees, the Verge reported (opens in new tab) on Thursday (June 16). The letter asks the founder of SpaceX and Tesla to change his ways.

""Elon's behavior in the public sphere is a frequent source of distraction and embarrassment for us, particularly in recent weeks,"" the letter states.

Much of that behavior unfolds on Twitter, which Musk is trying to buy. The billionaire is very active on the platform, sometimes using it to make crude jokes (opens in new tab) or insult people (opens in new tab). In 2018, for example, he implied that a man involved in rescuing Thai boys from a flooded cave is a pedophile (opens in new tab).

""As our CEO and most prominent spokesperson, Elon is seen as the face of SpaceX — every tweet that Elon sends is a de facto public statement by the company,"" the letter adds. ""It is critical to make clear to our teams and to our potential talent pool that his messaging does not reflect our work, our mission or our values.""

Elon Musk: Revolutionary private space entrepreneur

It is unclear who wrote the letter, although the document itself claims employees ""across the spectra of gender, ethnicity, seniority and technical roles have collaborated on"" its authorship, The Verge said. The employees who posted the letter did not respond to requests for comment from that website.

The document suggests three different ""action items"" to remedy what is happening. These items include SpaceX leadership denouncing ""Elon's harmful Twitter behavior,"" condemning other senior company leaders for similar conduct, and defining ""what exactly is intended by SpaceX’s 'no-asshole' and 'zero tolerance' policies and enforce them consistently.""

Musk, Time Magazine's 2021 person of the year, has also denied an allegation of sexual misconduct concerning his activities with a flight attendant in 2016, a story that was broken by Business Insider (opens in new tab).

And multiple former SpaceX employees recently alleged that the company as a whole doesn't do enough to punish or discourage sexual harassment in the workplace, The Verge reported in another story (opens in new tab).

After Business Insider's sexual harassment story about Musk came out, SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell sent a company-wide email (opens in new tab) to employees defending Musk, according to The Verge's story today.

""Personally, I believe the allegations to be false; not because I work for Elon, but because I have worked closely with him for 20 years and never seen nor heard anything resembling these allegations,"" Shotwell wrote. ""Anyone who knows Elon like I do knows he would never conduct or condone this alleged inappropriate behavior.""

SpaceX is engaged in numerous government, military and commercial projects. For example, NASA picked SpaceX's huge Starship vehicle to land astronauts on the moon a few years from now. The agency also awarded SpaceX contracts to fly cargo and astronauts to the International Space Station. And the company supplies Starlink satellite-internet service to customers around the world.

"Millionaires join Davos protests, demanding ‘tax us now’",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/22/millionaires-join-davos-protests-demanding-tax-us-now-taxation-wealthy-cost-of-living-crisis,nottheonion,"A group of millionaires have joined protests against the World Economic Forum gathering of the business and political elite in Davos, Switzerland, demanding that governments “tax us now” to tackle the burgeoning gulf between rich and poor.

The unlikely protesters, who describe themselves as “patriotic millionaires”, called on world leaders attending the annual conference on Sunday to immediately introduce fresh taxes on the wealthy in order to tackle the “cost of living scandal playing out in multiple nations around the world”.

The charity Oxfam recently said rising inequality could push as many as 263 million more people into extreme poverty in 2022, reversing decades of progress.

Phil White, a former business consultant and member of Patriotic Millionaires UK, said: “While the rest of the world is collapsing under the weight of an economic crisis, billionaires and world leaders meet in this private compound to discuss turning points in history.

“It’s outrageous that our political leaders listen to those who have the most, know the least about the economic impact of this crisis, and many of whom pay infamously little in taxes. The only credible outcome from this conference is to tax the richest and tax us now. Tax the delegates attending Davos 2022.”

The protest comes as it was revealed that there were now a record 177 billionaires in the UK, with a combined fortune of £653bn.

At the same time more than 250,000 UK households are predicted to slide into destitution next year because of soaring food and energy bills. That would take the total number in extreme poverty to about 1.2 million, unless the government acts to help the poorest families hit by the huge rise in energy prices, according to the National Institute for Economic and Social Research (NIESR).

Marlene Engelhorn, another “patriotic millionaire” at the protest, said the only solution to “gross inequality” was to demand that governments “tax me, tax the rich”.

Engelhorn, an heir to the founders of the BASF chemical company, who co-founded the #taxmenow initiative, said: “As someone who has enjoyed the benefits of wealth my whole life, I know how skewed our economy is and I cannot continue to sit back and wait for someone, somewhere, to do something. I feel there is no option left for us other than to take action.

“Our governments continue to do nothing to address gross inequality and instead meet behind closed doors in this spectacle of private wealth. We have hit the end of the line when another quarter of a billion people will be pushed into extreme poverty this year. It’s time to rebalance the world. It’s time to tax the rich.”

The theme of this year’s WEF meeting in Davos – the first-in-person gathering in more than two years, because of the pandemic – is “working together, restoring trust”.

Djaffar Shalchi, a Danish multimillionaire engineer and property developer, said: “You don’t win people’s trust by holding events like Davos, where the world’s rich and powerful meet behind layers of security. The most significant thing Davos participants could do to actually win people’s trust is to acknowledge that the wealth and privilege they represent and protect, is incompatible with a world where everyone can live full and prosperous lives.”"
"""Utah passed a bill clarifying that officers shouldn’t shoot at people who are only a threat to themselves""",https://www.sltrib.com/news/2021/05/20/unified-police-officer/,nottheonion,"(Trent Nelson | The Salt Lake Tribune) Alexis Hilbelink at her home in Salt Lake City on Thursday, May 20, 2021. Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill announced Thursday that a Unified police officer was legally justified in shooting Alexis' husband, Matthew Hilbelink, who was suicidal and who had pointed a gun at an officer.

Editor’s note: This story discusses suicide. If you or someone you know is experiencing suicidal thoughts, call the Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or the UNI CrisisLine at 801-587-3000.

She called the police on an August afternoon last year after her husband sent her a text saying he bought a gun and wanted to end his life.

It never occurred to Alexis Hilbelink that the police might shoot her husband, Matthew, when they found him sitting cross-legged in an empty parking lot with a gun in his hand.

“I just hoped they would talk to him,” she recalled Thursday. “Like they would help him. Because I knew he would not have shot himself or anybody. I thought they could just help him. I didn’t think it would be this stand-off situation.”

But that’s what happened.

Officers surrounded Matthew Hilbelink. They tried to talk to him, to plead with him to put the gun down — but Hilbelink didn’t respond. He had his finger on the trigger, according to the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office, and at times pointed the gun in an officer’s direction or at himself.

The last time he pointed the gun toward an officer, Unified Police Officer Dave Jaroscak fired, striking Hilbelink in the head. He died in a hospital three days later.

“When they told me they had shot him, I was like, ‘What do you mean?’” Alexis Hilbelink said. “It made no sense to me. Why would they do that? He wasn’t going to do anything to anybody.”

(Trent Nelson | The Salt Lake Tribune) Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill announced Thursday that a Unified police officer was legally justified in shooting Matthew Hilbelink, who was suicidal and who had pointed a gun at an officer. His wife, Alexis Hilbelink, talks at her home Thursday about the ruling and also a new law change that prohibits officers from shooting at someone who is suicidal but only a danger to themselves.

Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill announced Thursday that Jaroscak was justified in killing Hilbelink, saying it was reasonable that the officer feared for the safety of a colleague.

But Gill questioned whether the shooting was necessary.

“In essence, this was a shooting that did not need to happen,” he said. “But it was a shooting that was protected by the law.”

The outcome of similar situations could be different going forward — after Utah lawmakers passed a bill clarifying that police officers shouldn’t shoot at people who are only a threat to themselves.

Hilbelink’s family hopes the new law will save lives. His brother, Stephan Hilbelink, said they felt Gill’s ruling was “fair and correct according to the law the day of my brother’s shooting.”

“My hope and prayer is that [the new law] will be used correctly, wisely and to its fullest extent,” he said, “so families can have another day to help, love and support their loved ones with mental illness.”

The shooting

Alexis Hilbelink said her husband had depression, which had deepened during the pandemic because group therapy and other support had been canceled or was done online.

She was shocked when he texted her on Aug. 8 saying he had just bought a firearm. She didn’t know you could get a gun that quickly.

“My husband has a gun and he said he’s going to commit suicide,” she told a dispatcher. “And now he’s not at my house and I don’t know what to do. I’m at work.”

Officers were able to find Hilbelink, 39, in the parking lot near 3210 E. 6200 South in Holladay after his wife used an app to track his iPhone, according to Gill’s ruling.

When they arrived, three officers took cover behind a truck, according to Gill, and began talking to Hilbelink. Two had guns, and a third had a “less-lethal soft-foam projectile weapon.”

They tried to negotiate with Hilbelink for nearly 30 minutes.

“We learned that he liked hiking,” one officer later told investigators. “So, I tried to kind of start talking about ‘What hobbies do you like?’ Things of that nature. Talked about hiking and how we just went hiking, my wife and I. I talked about PTSD and how things could still be OK, just let us get the chance. ... He just wouldn’t take it. And he just kept looking at us like he was ... kind of that zombie kind of look. There was no one home, it seemed like. Like a man totally lost.”

Gill’s ruling said the officers kept talking to Hilbelink, but he never responded. He kept the gun in his hand, and at times pointed it at the officers and at himself.

A sergeant later told investigators he considered firing one of the foam bullets, but worried it would just agitate Hilbelink and cause him to shoot.

“At that point, I was going through in my mind, ‘Should I shoot him in the hand [with the less-lethal weapon], maybe break his hand so he can’t pull the trigger?” the sergeant recalled. “We’re not trained that way.”

Officers told investigators that, at some point, they saw Hilbelink’s expression change and he had what one officer described as a “thousand-yard stare.”

Jaroscak said in a statement that Hilbelink “then began to raise the gun from his thigh, and it appeared he was aiming at [another officer’s] exposed upper body, face and head. I believed that Hilbelink was about to shoot [the officer] if immediate action wasn’t taken. To protect [the officer], I shot Hilbelink.”

Gill wrote that it was reasonable for Jaroscak to believe that the other officer’s life was in danger. But the district attorney said even though the case was justified, he’s “troubled with the outcome in which a suicidal man with a gun is shot and killed by police.”

Gill said he questions if there was a better way for police to have responded. What was the training offered to the officers to deal with a suicidal man with a gun? Could a negotiator have been more readily available? Was there a better place to park the police truck to talk to Hilbelink? What’s the best way to protect the community while trying to contain the threat that Hilbelink posed?

“Could this have ended differently?” he said. “The answer to this ultimate question, and the answers to other more specific questions related to this encounter, may alter the course of future police encounters with similar circumstances.”

‘I need help’

Alexis Hilbelink wasn’t prepared for the onslaught of mental health issues her family would experience in the wake of her husband’s death.

Her four kids struggled. She struggled.

But when it came clear she needed outside help, she said she couldn’t find it. She thought as a nurse working at a cancer institute, she would have the resources. Maybe those resources were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, she said, but it wasn’t there when they needed it.

Alexis Hilbelink recalled once calling a hospital mobile crisis outreach team for one of her children, but the wait was two hours. She had no other choice but to call the police.

Officers with the same department who killed her husband showed up at her door.

“They would come to the house,” she said, “and I was like, ‘My kids don’t like you. But I need help.’”

The Holladay woman hopes that through the recent law change, no other family will go through what her family has.

Police officers in Utah are now prohibited from shooting at someone if the person is suicidal but isn’t a threat to anyone else.

The state law previously said a police officer was allowed to use deadly force if a suspect poses “a threat of serious bodily injury to the officer or to others.”

It’s expected that the new law will alter how police are trained, and allow them to retreat in situations where they are responding to a suicidal person who isn’t threatening anyone else.

That gives Alexis Hilbelink hope.

“When someone is experiencing a mental health crisis, when we call our police officers, we hope for help,” she said. “Not for them to shoot somebody. Hopefully, if a situation like this happens again, it gives me a little bit of comfort that maybe they’ll just back off.”"
"Vatican slams German reformers, warns of potential for schism",https://www.dw.com/en/vatican-slams-german-reformers-warns-of-potential-for-schism/a-62559108,nottheonion,"The Holy See rebuked the progressive ""Synodal Path,"" which seeks more agency for lay members, saying it has no authority on doctrine. They warned that issues taken up by the group could split the Catholic Church.

The Vatican on Thursday issued a terse statement on the progressive German Catholic movement known as the ""Synodal Path."" The statement warned German reformers they had no authority to instruct bishops on moral or doctrinal matters.

Moreover, the Holy See made clear that it views the Synodal Path's calls for addressing homosexuality, celibacy, and women in the Church as divisive and warned those calls could cause a fracture.

Members of the Synodal Path, a group made up of equal numbers of German bishops and lay Catholics, meet regularly. In February, they called on the Catholic Church to allow priests to marry, women to become deacons, and same-sex couples to receive the Church's blessing.

The Vatican, or Holy See, said the Synodal Path, ""does not have the faculty to oblige bishops and the faithful to assume new forms of governance and new approaches to doctrine and morals.""

To do so, read the statement, ""would represent a wound to ecclesial communion and a threat to the unity of the Church.""

German reformers responded to Vatican statement with 'astonishment'

Speaking on behalf of the Synodal Path, Chairman of the German Bishops' Conference Georg Bätzig and President of the Central Committee of German Catholics (ZdK) Irme Stetter-Karp, said they were ""astonished"" at the ""poor form"" the Vatican had shown by releasing such a statement to the public without putting a name to it.

Both Bätzig and Stetter-Karp vowed there would be no ""German deviation"" but said it is their ""responsibility to clearly point out where change is needed."" The two say the problems they are addressing are not unique to Germany, but common to dioceses all over the world.

Bätzig and Stetter-Karp voiced ""bemused regret"" over the fact that no direct communication with the Vatican had yet taken place.

On Saturday, the German Catholic women's movement Maria 2.0 (Mary 2.0) said church leaders should not fear confrontation with the Vatican.

Theologian Maria Mesrian, who represents the group, told Deutschlandfunk Radio that the bishops will have to ""decide whether they want a living church in Germany or whether they would rather lead a dead institution.""

Mesrian said the Vatican is all about ""power and the unity of the omnipresent church.""

Hundreds of thousands leave Catholic Church over lack of reform

The German group, formed in the wake of woefully mishandled clergy sexual abuse scandals, also calls for ordinary Catholics to have more of a say in how the Church operates. The Vatican again warned that if national Churches chose to pursue their own paths they would, ""weaken, rot and die.""

In 2021, 360,000 Catholics formally left the German Church— which has 22 million members in the country and rakes in €6.45 billion ($6.58 billion) in church taxes every year — in protest at corruption and abuse

Although progressive European and US Catholics would likely be willing to support progressive issues, such as blessing same-sex relationships and ordaining women, Rome would risk backlash with fast-growing South American and African congregations.

In 2019, Pope Francis warned German bishops against the temptation to change for the sake of appeasing certain groups or ideas. Observers speculate that the reforms could leave the Catholic Church open to a splintering, similar to the one which befell the Anglican and Protestant Churches after they introduced similar changes.

According to the Vatican statement, any changes to teaching on morals or doctrine must be taken up by the Church's own synodal path. The Holy See said preliminary consultations are already being held globally in preparation for a meeting of bishops next year in Rome.

The next gathering of the German Synodal Path is scheduled to convene on September 8-10.

Lady Gaga: Man accused of shooting singer's dog walker released from jail by mistake,https://news.sky.com/story/lady-gaga-man-accused-of-shooting-singers-dog-walker-released-from-jail-by-mistake-12585847,nottheonion,"A man accused of shooting and seriously wounding Lady Gaga's dog walker and stealing her two French bulldogs has been freed from jail by mistake.

James Howard Jackson was being held on an attempted murder charge but was released from a jail in Los Angeles ""due to a clerical error"", a sheriff's department said.

The 19-year-old is now being sought by the sheriff's major crimes bureau.

Prosecutors say Jackson and two other alleged gang members had driven around looking for expensive French bulldogs to steal on 24 February last year.

They then spotted, tailed and robbed Ryan Fischer as he walked the dogs belonging to Lady Gaga near Sunset Boulevard, it is alleged.

During a violent struggle, Fischer was hit, choked and then shot in an attack caught on camera by the doorbell camera of a nearby home, prosecutors say.

The video recorded the dog walker screaming ""Oh, my God! I've been shot!"" and ""Help me!"" and ""I'm bleeding out from my chest!""

The dramatic incident saw Fischer lose part of a lung.

Reacting to Jackson's mistaken release, Fischer said in a statement to KABC-TV: ""While I'm deeply concerned at the events that led to his release, I'm confident law enforcement will rectify the error.

""I ask for Mr Jackson to turn himself over to the authorities, so resolution to the crime committed against me runs its course, whatever the courts determine that outcome to be.""

"John Bolton: “As someone who has helped plan coups de etat — not here but, you know, other places — it takes a lot of work”",https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/3556437-john-bolton-says-hes-been-involved-in-planning-coups-it-takes-a-lot-of-work/,nottheonion,"Former Trump national security adviser John Bolton said during an appearance on CNN that he has helped plan coups in other countries while arguing that former President Trump’s actions leading up to the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack did not amount to a coup attempt.

Bolton told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Tuesday that Trump’s actions to overturn the election results were indefensible but added that the former president was a “disturbance in the force” rather than a leader of an “attack on our democracy. ”

Bolton said he disagrees with the premise that Trump attempted a coup, which he said requires cunning and elaborate planning.

“That’s not the way Donald Trump does things,” Bolton said. “It’s rambling from one … idea to another, one plan that falls through, and another comes up.”

“As somebody who has helped plan coup d’état, not here but other places, it takes a lot of work, and that’s not what he did,” Bolton added.

He said Trump did “unleash” the rioters on the Capitol, but it was not to overthrow the Constitution and instead was to give himself more time to challenge the results in state legislatures.

Tapper later pressed Bolton to clarify what he was referencing in his comment about having planned coups. Bolton cited a failed 2019 Venezuelan coup attempt against President Nicolás Maduro, though he added that the U.S. government did not have “much to do with” it.

Protesters took to the streets in late April of that year to force Maduro from power, led by National Assembly leader Juan Guaidó, whom the U.S. still recognizes as the interim president, even though the putsch was unsuccessful.

“The notion that Donald Trump was half as competent as the Venezuelan opposition is laughable,” Bolton said.

The former United Nations ambassador also said if anyone thinks Trump has higher aims than delaying the election certification, “you’re going to overreact, and I think that’s a real risk for the committee, which has done a lot of good work.”

Bolton has served in multiple positions over the years in the administrations of former Presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush and Trump.

The committee’s public hearing on Tuesday focused on Trump’s efforts to rally his supporters to come to Washington, D.C., ahead of Jan. 6, the date Congress was set to certify the results of the election.

The committee revealed during its hearing that texts and an unpublished draft of a tweet show that Trump’s call for his supporters to march to the Capitol was not spontaneous.

Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), the committee’s vice chairwoman, also revealed that Trump tried to call a witness expected to appear at a future hearing, raising further questions about potential witness tampering."
Missouri governor rebuffed: Journalist won’t be prosecuted for viewing HTML,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/02/missouri-governor-rebuffed-journalist-wont-be-prosecuted-for-viewing-html/,nottheonion,"A Cole County prosecutor has rebuffed Missouri Gov. Mike Parson's request to file criminal charges against a St. Louis Post-Dispatch reporter who identified a major security flaw in a government website by viewing publicly available HTML code.

Post-Dispatch reporter Josh Renaud had been facing the threat of prosecution since his discovery that the state website's HTML source code exposed the full Social Security numbers of teachers and other school employees in unencrypted form. Renaud merely viewed the website's HTML and converted the Social Security numbers into plain text, and he gave the state time to close the gaping security hole before publishing his findings. Despite Renaud helping the state improve its security, Parson called the journalist a ""hacker,"" sought criminal charges, and threatened a civil suit.

On Friday, Cole County Prosecutor Locke Thompson issued a statement saying he has closed the investigation without charges:

There is an argument to be made that there was a violation of law. However, upon a review of the case file, the issues at the heart of the investigation have been resolved through non-legal means. As such, it is not in the best interest of Cole County citizens to utilize the significant resources and taxpayer dollars that would be necessary to pursue misdemeanor criminal charges in this case. The investigation is now closed, and the Cole County Prosecutor's Office will have no further comment on the matter.

As the county's prosecuting attorney, Thompson is an elected official. Thompson and Parson are both Republicans.

Governor still insists reporter committed crime

Gov. Parson's office continues to insist that the journalist committed a crime. ""The hacking of Missouri teachers' personally identifiable information is a clear violation of Section 569.095, which the state takes seriously. The state did its part by investigating and presenting its findings to the Cole County Prosecutor, who has elected not to press charges, as is his prerogative,"" the governor's office said in a statement to Missourinet.

Normally, an organization notified of a security flaw would thank the person who reported it. Missouri state government officials did in fact plan to publicly thank Renaud in a press release, according to internal emails published by the Post-Dispatch in December.

But that draft of the press release was scrapped as the governor insisted on calling Renaud a hacker and demanding a criminal investigation. ""It is unlawful to access encoded data and systems in order to examine other people's personal information, and we are coordinating state resources to respond and utilize all legal methods available,"" Parson said in October. In addition to announcing that his ""administration notified the Cole County prosecutor of this matter,"" Parson said that state law ""allows us to bring a civil suit to recover damages against all those involved."" No civil suit has been filed.

Thompson's decision to close the investigation came about seven weeks after the Missouri Highway Patrol finished its report on the incident."
"Marjorie Taylor Greene Urged for ""Marshall"" Law After Capitol Insurrection",https://ourgeneration.news/news/marjorie-taylor-greene-urged-for-marshall-law-after-capitol-insurrection,nottheonion,"A little over a week after the capitol building was stormed by thousands of Trump supporters, some Republican congressmen were calling for martial law, or as one put it “Marshall” law. CNN has released more than 2,000 unseen text messages sent to and from Trump's chief of staff Mark Meadows, many showing the thoughts and plans of Trump’s most zealous political allies in the wake of the attack.

Greene reached out to Meadows on December 31st, “Good morning Mark, I’m here in DC. We have to get organized for the 6th. I would like to meet with Rudy Giuliani again. We didn’t get to speak with him long. Also anyone who can help. We are getting a lot of members on board. And we need to lay out the best case for each state.” While Greene was eager to “organize” for the 6th by the day itself her text messages to Meadows showed the dangers of the situation she had herself supported: “Mark I was just told there is an active shooter on the first floor of the Capitol Please tell the President to calm people This isn’t the way to solve anything.” During that day thousands of supporters of the ex-president stormed the Capitol building, breaking into the offices of Congressmen and attacking law enforcement. 5 people were killed, 140 police officers were injured, and the damages to the building quickly amounted to over $30 million.

Greene texted Meadows the next day: “Yesterday was a terrible day. We tried everything we could in our objection to the 6 states. I’m sorry nothing worked. I don’t think that President Trump caused the attack on the Capitol. It’s not his fault. Antifa was mixed in the crowed and instigated it, and sadly people followed. But when people try everything and no one listens and nothing works, I guess they think they have no other choice. Absolutely no excuse and I fully denounce all of it, but after shut downs all year and a stolen election, people are saying that they have no other choice. I defended Trump last night on Newsmax. He has been the greatest President. I will continue to defend him. And you if anyone attacks you. I hope you are ok. I feel badly for everyone.”

“Thanks Marjorie” was the terse reply from Meadows.

While Marjorie seemed remorseful the day after the attack, within ten days she was calling for the ex-president to call for martial law (something he had zero authority to do). ""In our private chat with only Members, several are saying the only way to save our Republic is for Trump to call for Marshall law [sic],"" Greene texted Trump's then-chief of staff, Mark Meadows, on Jan. 17, 2021, 11 days after the attack. ""I don’t know on those things,"" Greene continued in her exchange with Meadows. ""I just wanted you to tell him. They stole this election. We all know. They will destroy our country next. Please tell him to declassify as much as possible so we can go after Biden and anyone else!"" Greene continued by claiming that the insurrectionists were actually antifascists “dressed as Trump supporters.” This sentiment was echoed by Republican Representative Louie Gohmert who texted Meadows: “Cap[itol] Police told me last night they’d been warned that today there’d be a lot of Antifa dressed in red Trump shirts & hats & would likely get violent.”

Martial law is the imposition of direct military control of normal civil functions or suspension of civil law by a government, especially in response to an emergency where civil forces are overwhelmed, or in an occupied territory. In the United States, martial law has been used in a limited number of circumstances, such as during insurrections like the Battle of New Orleans; major disasters like the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 or the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, or during riots, such as the Omaha race riot of 1919 or the 1920 Lexington riots.

Greene became the first member of Congress to testify under oath about the attacks on April 22nd. Greene repeatedly denied she or her office gave tours to or met with Trump protesters ahead of the Jan. 6 rally or that she provided maps of the Capitol building. ""I would have to talk to people on my campaign, but I don't think we did,"" she said. ""How would we have done that? We didn't do anything like that,"" She repeatedly answered that she didn't recall sending tweets or making other social media posts or the circumstances around many of the statements shown on a video monitor. Greene continued to claim she was opposed to violence. She blamed members of her staff for liking Facebook comments calling for the killing of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi."

Blind men verbally abused by 'animal rights activist' who screams it is cruel to use guide dogs,https://meaww.com/blind-men-verbal-abuse-scream-animal-rights-activist-cruel-use-guide-dogs-dr-amit-patel,nottheonion,"A blind disability activist has said that he and a blind friend were verbally abused by an ""animal rights activist"" who is said to have become angry that they were using guide dogs.

Dr. Amit Patel was enjoying a drink with his friend at the Portsmouth Mariott when an ""aggressive"" woman approached them and started screaming at them because she was not happy they had guide dogs with them.

""Last night: two blind guys & our dogs at a bar, having a quiet drink"", he tweeted. ""We then get accosted by an aggressive woman screaming that we’re cruel for having Guide Dogs. Not only was she in our faces but at one point I thought she‘d get physical. Not a comfortable position to be in [sic].""

Social media users immediately came to his support, with one user writing, ""Disgraceful. I’m so sorry you both had to go through that. People really can be awful.""

Another commented, ""A speciest - I didn't realize that they were taking it this far. So sorry that you are on the receiving end of their dogma - which would, no doubt, evaporate if they needed an assistance dog [sic].""

Speaking to Unilad, Dr. Patel detailed the incident further and said the woman declared herself as an animal rights activist and told them they were ""absolutely cruel"" for having the dogs with them. He said the woman went as far as to suggest that he and Jonathan were as bad as the people who organized dog fights.

Ironically enough, just earlier the same night, Dr. Patel had spoken at the Animal Star Awards, an awards evening dedicated to service animals and humans within the animal industry, and described the problems faced by those who used such animals in their everyday lives.

""It's ironic that earlier in the eve I was on stage & gave an anecdote about the grief assistance dog owners get from some people about our working dogs"", he wrote. ""Our dogs are so loved, well cared for & love their jobs. If they didn't, they wouldn't work.""

Dr. Patel explained that there was a misconception that these animals were ""forced to work"" and that, over the past few months, guide dog owners, medical detection dog owners, hearing dog owners, and such had been receiving grief about owning the animals because of this.

""Can you imagine having someone shout at you when you can’t hear them?"" he said. ""And it’s people with hearing loss, you know. It’s crazy. Imagine shouting at someone who is deaf, who has a hearing dog, and telling them they are cruel. It’s not on.""

He also cleared the air around the claims that these dogs were somehow being abused because they were made to work. ""These dogs don’t make it through their training if they don’t want to work"", he said. ""A lot of dogs don’t make it through their training because they don’t want to work because they’re not interested or they’re too sniffy.""

""You know, to be able to trust your life to a guide dog, that dog has to be concentrated 24/7"", he added. ""I can’t go through central London at peak time and have a dog that has a kind of 'I don’t really want to work but I’ll do it anyway' attitude. My guide dog has to be on it all the time."""
North Carolina woman fights to keep her 'FART' license plate,https://abc30.com/fart-license-plate-nc-karly-sindy/11619556/,nottheonion,"FART -- That's the license plate one North Carolina woman paid extra money to have on the back of her vehicle.

ASHEVILLE, N.C. -- FART -- That's the license plate one North Carolina woman paid extra money to have on the back of her vehicle.

Karly Sindy of Asheville said the DMV approved her personalized license plate back in October. She was a bit surprised but excited when she received the plate in the mail.

She put it on her truck and went on her merry way, driving around town with ""FART"" on the back of her pickup.

But then on February 25, she received a letter in the mail from the DMV. The letter stated that the DMV had received some complaints about the plate.

The DMV asked Sindy to respond explaining what the plate meant to her and why it was important.

She and some friends online put their heads together and came up with an attempt to save the FART. They decided to tell the DMV that it was an acronym for their (completely made up) group: Friends of Asheville Recreational Trails.

Well we say ""completely made up,"" but that's not exactly accurate now. Now the group does exist. Sindy even said she had 15 people show up at the group's first meeting. The group now has a mailing list, a website, promotional stickers and t-shirts!

As for the license plate, it's yet to be seen if the DMV will allow Sindy to keep using FART. There are more than 9,000 personalized plates already banned in North Carolina. Time will tell if FART joins the list."
Trophy hunter who kills endangered elephants and lions 'eaten by crocodiles',https://www.sonyaz.net/trophy-hunter-who-kills-endangered-elephants-and-lions-eaten-by-crocodiles/5178/,nottheonion,"It is believed Mr van Zyl and his tracker left their truck and walked in different directions into the bush. The dogs later returned to the camp without Mr van Zyl, whose belongings were found inside the vehicle. Rescue teams were sent to search for the hunter and helicopters, trackers and divers all scoured the region.



His tracks were later spotted leading to the banks of the river and his backpack was located nearby. Sakkie Louwrens, a member of one of the search teams, said police suspected two Nile crocodiles may have eaten Mr Van Zyl.



“We found what could possibly be human remains in them,” he told The Telegraph. Forensic experts are currently testing whether the remains belong to Mr van Zyl. The SS Pro Safaris website, owned by Mr van Zyl, states the company ""has conducted numerous safaris"" throughout Southern Africa. These include ""elephants in Botswana to the smallest blue duiker in KwaZulu Natal"".



It goes on to list buffalo, rhino, lions, leopards and antelopes as targets for hunts. There have been previous incidents in southern Zimbabwe of people being killed by crocodiles.

Queen’s bees notified of monarch’s death in bizarre tradition,https://www.geo.tv/latest/439381-queens-bees-notified-of-monarchs-death-in-bizarre-tradition,nottheonion,"Queen Elizabeth II’s death was announced to Buckingham Palace bees on Friday in a bizarre tradition which dates back centuries.



According to Daily Mail, the royal housekeeper John Chapple revealed that he went to the palace and Clarence House to carry out the ritual.

The palace hives have also been told that now King Charles III is their new master after Britain’s longest-serving monarch breathed her last at Balmoral on Thursday.

The 79-year-old housekeeper told the outlet: “It is traditional when someone dies that you go to the hives and say a little prayer and put a black ribbon on the hive.

“I drape the hives with black ribbon with a bow,” he said.

Chapple continued: “The person who has died is the master or mistress of the hives, someone important in the family who dies and you don’t get any more important than the Queen, do you?

“You knock on each hive and say, ‘The mistress is dead, but don't you go. Your master will be a good master to you.’

Parents sue TikTok after 7 kids die from profitable Blackout Challenge videos,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/07/parents-sue-tiktok-after-7-kids-die-from-profitable-blackout-challenge-videos,nottheonion,"After the first child died from self-strangulation while attempting a recommended ""Blackout Challenge,"" there were many steps that TikTok could have taken to shield other kids from the same fate immediately. Instead, a new lawsuit filed in California says TikTok chose to continue profiting from promoting what's now being described as its deadliest challenge, directly causing the deaths of six more children in 2021.

The lawsuit was filed by the parents of two of those children—girls ages 8 and 9. They claim their kids became addicted to TikTok, were fed a constant stream of seemingly harmless challenge videos persuading them to participate, and then died after attempting the Blackout Challenge. (The Blackout Challenge encourages TikTok users to post videos where they choke themselves until they pass out.)

Rather than blame creators of harmful videos or come after TikTok for publishing videos, the lawsuit instead seeks damages from TikTok for its product design, which directs kids to videos.

In a statement, the parents' legal team at the Social Media Victims Law Center (SMVLC) summarized the lengthy complaint: ""The suit alleges that TikTok's defective design of its social media product results in an addictive product that is not safe for users and fails to warn minors and their parents that TikTok is addictive and pushes harmful content onto their 'For You' page that could endanger their wellbeing.""

TikTok did not immediately respond to Ars' request for comment, but a TikTok spokesperson told The New York Times that ""the company would not comment on continuing litigation."" The spokesperson also linked to a prior company statement to People magazine about a 10-year-old girl who also died after attempting the Blackout Challenge. At that time, TikTok said that the ""disturbing challenge"" predated their platform and had never become ""a TikTok trend."" Expressing ""deepest sympathies"" to the family affected in that case, TikTok vowed to ""remain vigilant in our commitment to user safety"" and ""immediately remove related content if found.""

The lawsuit tells a different story, pointing out that ""the 'Blackout Challenge' currently cannot be found on TikTok's social media product,"" which proves that the videos could have been removed after TikTok learned of the first death. Instead, the company chose not to take that or any earlier action to limit child exposure to the challenge, even though ""the cost of incorporating age and identity verification into TikTok's product would be negligible.""

Parents want TikTok to pay for addicting their kids, demanding a jury trial to decide whether TikTok's design needs to change. Damages sought right now are unspecified but are expected to cover intangible losses suffered by the kids before they died, as well as the loss of each kid's ""future earning capacity"" and ""normal activities, pursuits, and pleasures.""

""TikTok needs to be held accountable for pushing deadly content to these two young girls,"" said SMVLC attorney Matthew P. Bergman, who is part of the parents' legal team. ""TikTok has invested billions of dollars to intentionally design products that push dangerous content that it knows are dangerous and can result in the deaths of its users.""

What could TikTok have done?

Parents suing TikTok say it's obvious when kids post videos of themselves that they're too young for TikTok. The lawsuit claims that the platform knows that ""hundreds of thousands of children as young as 6 years old are currently using its social media product,"" but makes no attempt to terminate accounts for users under 12 because that would diminish the company's ad revenue.

""TikTok has information and knowledge that can determine with reasonably [sic] certainty each user's age, habits, and other personal information, regardless of what information the user provides at the time of account setup,"" the complaint states. ""In other words, TikTok knows when a user claims to be 21 but is really 12.""

Keeping kids under 13 off TikTok isn't the only option, though. The lawsuit claims there are many actions that TikTok could have taken to save lives after the first report from January 2021 of a child dying after attempting the ""Blackout Challenge."""
A women in Bihar (India) was found living with her lover while her husband was in jail for her 'murder',https://www.indiatoday.in/crime/story/motihari-news-woman-declared-dead-found-living-boyfriend-husband-served-jail-murder-1944591-2022-05-02,nottheonion,"In a bizarre incident, police traced a woman from Jalandhar, living with her boyfriend, who was declared dead in Bihar. The husband of the woman was sent to jail after the woman's father had accused him of murdering her.

By India Today Web Desk: In what is being suspected to be a case of a love triangle, a woman who was declared dead in Motihari district of Bihar was found living with her lover in Jalandhar. What is even more shocking is that her husband was serving punishment in jail for her alleged 'murder'.

The woman, identified as Shanti Devi, married Dinesh Ram, a resident of Laxmipur, on June 14, 2016. Years after marriage, Shanti allegedly ran away from her husband's home on April 19 and went to live with her paramour in Punjab.

After the woman went missing, her family members approached the police and accused the husband of dowry harassment and also alleged that he had murdered her. Acting on the complaint of the victim's kin, police arrested Dinesh and he was sent to jail on murder charges.

IN-LAWS ACCUSED OF DOWRY

Shanti's father, Yogendra Yadav, had told police, ""My daughter married Dinesh Ram in 2016 but on April 19, I received information that she was nowhere to be found. I went to her in-laws' house and checked but in vain. Last year, my daughter was tortured for dowry as her in-laws had demanded a motorbike and Rs 50,000 cash.""

He then filed an FIR against Dinesh, following which he was arrested.

However, things took an interesting turn when the Station House Officer smelled a rat and urged the technical team to trace the mobile phone location of Shanti. With the help of technical surveillance, police found that the woman, who was declared dead, was actually living with her lover in Jalandhar district of Punjab.

A police team was constituted after the matter came to light and the woman was brought back to Motihari.

"Paraplegic shooting suspect can avoid trial and end his life, Spanish court says",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/05/paraplegic-shooting-suspect-can-avoid-trial-and-end-his-life-spanish-court-says,nottheonion,"A Spanish court has ruled that a paraplegic man, who was accused of firing on colleagues in a rage before being shot in the spine by police, can avoid trial as he has the right to end his life.

Last December, Marin Eugen Sabau, 46, a Romanian security guard, allegedly fired on his former co-workers at a security company in Tarragona in eastern Spain, seriously injuring three people. He later shot and injured a police officer before being severely wounded by police marksmen.

The national court in Tarragona upheld an earlier court ruling that, given his condition, Sabau had a right to euthanasia under a law passed last year. The court said the law had not anticipated a situation in which a person facing criminal charges might request assisted dying.

Euthanasia was a “fundamental right” with which the judicial system could not interfere, the court said.

Spain’s euthanasia law allows adults with “serious and incurable” conditions that cause “unbearable suffering” to choose to end their lives.

The decision was rejected by lawyers representing the wounded police officer, who has appealed to the constitutional court.

“The national court’s decision is erroneous,” argued Antonio Bitos, the lawyer representing the wounded officer. “It hasn’t taken into account the victims’ suffering nor their dignity.”

Bitos accused the court of “squandering” the opportunity to rule on a unique case. Sabau had been due to be euthanised on 28 July and if the appeal fails he will get his wish.

In a statement released from the prison hospital in July, Sabau said: “I’m paraplegic. I’ve got 45 stitches in one hand and I can barely move my left arm. I’m full of screws and I can’t feel my chest.”

He claimed that his bosses at the Securitas company had made his life “a living hell” and that he was a victim of exploitation and racism. Before the attack, he sent an email to his superiors that read: “I’ve got no option, I will take the law into my own hands. Lessons learned with blood aren’t easily forgotten.”

He also claimed that the Mossos d’Esquadra, the Catalan police, fired first and without warning and continued to fire when he was already unconscious.

In its ruling, the court recognised that Sabau caused “pain as well as physical and moral damage to his victims” and that there was reason to assume he would be convicted of crimes.

However, it added, his condition causes “constant physical and psychological suffering without any possibility of relief and he faces the prospect of a very limited life”."
"Jonny Greenwood on early Radiohead rehearsals: “The first thing I did was make sure my keyboard was turned off. I must have done months of rehearsals, and they didn’t know that I’d already turned it off”",https://www.musicradar.com/news/jonny-greenwood-on-early-radiohead-rehearsals,nottheonion,"In a recent interview (opens in new tab) with Terry Gross for NPR's Fresh Air podcast, Radiohead guitarist and film composer Jonny Greenwood shared some fascinating insights into his early experiences playing with the band.

Speaking about forming the group as schoolmates in the mid-80s, Greenwood described playing a deliberately muted keyboard for several months so as not to disturb the band's dynamic. ""Thom's band had a keyboard player — [whom] I think they didn't get on with because he played his keyboard so loud"" he said.

""And so when I got the chance to play with them, the first thing I did was make sure my keyboard was turned off ... I must have done months of rehearsals with them with this keyboard, and they didn't know that I'd already turned it off.""

""They made quite a racket, quite a noise. It was all guitars and distortion — and so I would pretend to play for weeks on end and Thom would say, ""I can't quite hear what you're doing, but I think you're adding a really interesting texture, because I can tell when you're not playing.""

""And I'm thinking, ""No, you can't, because I'm really not playing."" And I'd go home in the evening and work out how to actually play chords and cautiously over the next few months, I would start turning this keyboard up. And that's how I started in with Radiohead.""

Elsewhere in the interview, Greenwood discussed his approach to scoring films such as Paul Thomas Anderson's Licorice Pizza and Jane Campion's The Power of The Dog, which recently picked up 12 Oscar nominations, including Best Score.

Recalling his experiences working with violinist Daniel Pioro to coax unconventional sounds from his instrument, he said: ""Daniel is a very physical player indeed, and is interested in every possible color and texture. I love a recording where you can hear the physicality of what's happening, whether it's the breathing of the player or just the effort involved in making the music.

""I know it drives some people crazy, but things like Glenn Gould singing along and all of that remind that there's all this muscle ... behind the making of the music. It just makes it more exciting to me. I think that stuff is, quite often, clinically stripped out in most people's consumption of music. Especially classical music.""

Much like the music he writes with Radiohead, Greenwood's scores are highly experimental, featuring unorthodox harmonies, irregular time signatures, unconventional instruments and extended playing techniques.

""I always found acoustic instruments, certainly orchestral instruments, to be capable of much more variety and strangeness and complexity than nearly all of the software I've used in the past"", he continued.

""And I think that's maybe why, to me, music by people like [Krzysztof] Penderecki and [Gyorgy] Ligeti ... still sounds very strange and contemporary, and they still sound like the music of the future to me. Whereas lots of the electronic stuff that was done in the '60s and '70s, you hear it now, and it's just of its time.""

Convoy protesters plan to stand up to high fuel prices by filling up their cars and driving around New Zealand,https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2022/06/convoy-protesters-plan-to-stand-up-to-high-fuel-prices-by-filling-up-their-cars-and-driving-around-new-zealand.html,nottheonion,"A poster circulating on social media reads: ""Enough is enough. We deserve better.""

""Start your engines get ready to roll!"" it continues.

""Stand up to fuel prices New Zealand-wide!""

People on social media have noticed the irony of the posts pointing out that the protest against fuel prices involves buying a lot of fuel.

""Protesting rising fuel prices by driving is possibly the silliest thing I've heard,"" one person said.

""Can't afford the petrol,"" another person commented.

However, one of the protest supporters said while they can see the irony, they said gathering in a large group and making noise is the best way to gain attention and encourages anyone to do whatever they can to support.

It appears the protest has some crossover with the anti-mandate crowd after a link to the protest was shared by Zeb Jackson Live, who according to the NZ Herald live-streamed her confrontation with former All Black Eric Rush over a not wearing a mask at a supermarket.

A spokesperson for the event said in a press release they believe the looming fuel crisis was avoidable by the Government.

""Fuel is an essential item and not a luxury, it is vital to food security and a healthy economy along with healthy families and a healthy society,"" the spokesperson said.

They said they believe the closing of the country's only oil refinery Marsden Point has directly contributed to the fuel crisis.

A police spokesperson said they are aware of the planned action in some North Island locations and will be monitoring it.

Police said they will respond to any issues if they arise."

"US man gets $450,000 after unwanted work birthday party triggered panic attack Kentucky man says former employer ignored his request not to celebrate his birthday due to his anxiety disorder",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/18/unwanted-office-birthday-party-lawsuit-panic-attack,nottheonion,"A Kentucky man was awarded $450,000 in a lawsuit against his former employer, after the company disregarded his wish not to be given a birthday party.

In August 2019, Gravity Diagnostics, a medical laboratory, ignored Kevin Berling’s request not to celebrate his birthday due to his anxiety disorder.

According to Tony Bucher, Berling’s attorney, Berling spoke to the birthday celebration organizer about his request not to have a party, but “the person who was responsible for the birthday parties who he talked to flat-out forgot about his request”.

As a result, the company hosted the celebration, at which Berling suffered a panic attack.

According to Bucher, Berling went to his car, practiced breathing techniques, ate his lunch and then texted his manager, upset his request had been ignored.

The person who scheduled the party, Berling said, “didn’t do it to be mean. She said she would accommodate [Berling’s request] and she just forgot.”

The next day, according to Berling’s lawsuit, Berling was “confronted and criticized” for his reaction.

“According to my client, [his managers] started reading him the riot act and accused him of stealing other co-workers’ joy,” Bucher told Link NKY.

According to the lawsuit, “this confrontation triggered another panic attack”.

Amid this attack, Bucher said, co-workers asked Berling to stop using coping mechanisms including “hugging himself”. When he did not, the staff members walked out.

Bucher said: “The way [they] say it, they believed he was enraged and possibly about to get violent.”

Berling’s lawsuit said: “At the conclusion of this meeting and because plaintiff had a panic attack, plaintiff was sent home from work for the remainder of 8 and 9 August.”

Berling apologized for having a panic attack. But, his lawsuit said, three days later he received an email from the company, “informing him that he was being terminated because of the events of the previous week”.

According to court documents, a jury awarded Berling $450,000, including “$120,000 in lost wages and benefits; $30,000 in future lost wages and benefits; and $300,000 for past, present and future mental pain and suffering, mental anguish, embarrassment, humiliation, mortification and loss of self-esteem”.

In a statement, Kenton circuit court judge Patricia Summe said Berling “was able to perform the essential functions of his job with or without reasonable accommodations” but “suffered an adverse employment action because of that disability”.

Julie Brazil, chief operating officer of Gravity Diagnostics, said the verdict set a dangerous precedent for employers and employees that unless physical violence happens, any other form of workplace violence is permissible.

“As an employer who puts our employee safety first, we have a zero-tolerance policy and we stand by our decision to terminate the plaintiff for his violation of our workplace violence policy,” Brazil told Link NKY.

“My employees were the victims in this case, not the plaintiff.”

Brazil indicated that the company would appeal."

Janie Doe, whose identity we are not revealing because of the nature of the case, was a senior in high school last year.

Her mother, who we also are not identifying for her daughter's sake, said she has the mentality of a 5 or 6-year-old and should not be left alone. She said the now-19-year-old cannot read and has trouble writing.

""She believes in Santa,"" her mother said. ""She believes in the Easter bunny, and her favorite animal is a unicorn. She looks at the world as a happy, good place, or she used to. Now she's scared.""

In November 2021, her mother said she got a call from an Alvin ISD police officer saying her daughter was in the nurse's office.

""He says, 'We believe she has been sexually assaulted,' and I said, 'What?'"" her mother recalled. ""He repeated himself and I said, 'What?' because I couldn't accept what he was saying to me. He said, 'You might want to come up here.'""

The woman said her daughter was questioned alone by the district for an hour and they attempted to go through her phone.

She said the police told her that a witness heard her daughter yelling ""no"" and ""stop"" while she was in the bathroom.

Immediately after, she took Janie Doe to the hospital for a SANE exam. She said she had marks on her neck and abrasions on her face.

""She told me when she was doing the female exam to her lower anatomy that she said, 'Yes, there is bruising. There is tearing. She was hurt.'""

From there, the mother said Alvin ISD tried to claim her daughter consented.

""'Your daughter walked down the hallway with him so she consented.' But I said she never should have been alone,"" the mother said. ""My daughter would walk down the hallway with Jeffrey Dahmer, because she can't read people.""

The distraught mother learned from the principal that the male student was suspended for three days.

""(The principal) said, 'Things are better now,'"" the mother said. ""'He's being watched now. The teacher has been moved now. The powers are doing their job now.' I took that as a slap in the face.""

She said she wants the people who allowed her daughter to be gone for an extended period of time without supervision to be fired and the student to be arrested.

The family does not have a lawyer and has not filed a lawsuit against the district.

""All the money in the world can't undo what they did to my daughter,"" the mother said.

Her daughter is now in counseling and has had a seizure for the first time in her life since the assault.

""She didn't speak for probably about five weeks,"" she said. ""She wasn't herself. I don't know if she will ever be who she was before.""

ABC13 learned the case was turned over to the juvenile division of the Brazoria County District Attorney's Office and a grand jury declined to file charges against the boy. We stopped by their office to find out why and are waiting on an answer.

We also sent in a public records request a week ago asking for all of the documents that were turned over to the district attorney's office. Alvin ISD sent our request to the Texas Attorney General's Office to determine what they can release. It will take weeks or months to get an answer.

Alvin ISD released the following statement to ABC13:

""Alvin ISD is deeply committed to the wellbeing of each one of our students, as well as providing a safe environment for our students.The District is aware of recent social media posts concerning an alleged incident of sexual assault occurring at Alvin High School during the fall semester of 2021. The District vehemently denies that its staff improperly responded to the allegations. While the District is prohibited by law from commenting on the outcome of the investigation, all confirmed instances of student misconduct are handled in accordance with federal law, state law, and District policy. Furthermore, any confirmed or suspected instances of criminal activity are referred to the appropriate law enforcement agencies for investigation, and ultimately to the District Attorney for disposition. Alvin ISD remains committed to honoring the trust families place in our district when they send their children to our schools.""

In 2011, a federal lawsuit was filed in the Southern District of Texas alleging very similar circumstances. A woman said her daughter with special needs was raped in a bathroom at Alvin High School and the district did not properly handle the situation.

The plaintiffs ultimately filed to have the case dismissed with prejudice against Alvin ISD and the staff members individually listed. They also requested the case be ruled in favor of Alvin ISD.

"‘I have the biggest d*** in Chicago’: Mayor Lightfoot sued for defamation, accused of profane comments",https://wgntv.com/news/chicago-news/i-have-the-biggest-d-in-chicago-mayor-lightfoot-sued-for-defamation-accused-of-profane-comments/,nottheonion,"This is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.

CHICAGO — A former attorney for the City of Chicago is suing Mayor Lori Lightfoot for defamation after she allegedly berated a group of lawyers during a heated meeting over the removal of the Christopher Columbus Statue.

The statue was removed in July 2020 following unrest over the murder of George Floyd. Under Lightfoot’s orders, crews used a large crane to remove the statue from its pedestal in Grant Park following a week after protesters trying to topple the monument clashed with police.

The lawsuit, filed Wednesday by former Chicago Park District counsel general George Smyrniotis, says Lightfoot blocked a deal with an Italian-American group to display the statue in the Columbus Day Parade.

Smyrniotis claims she berated the lawyers who struck the deal, asking them which law school they attended or if they even went to law school. The suit claims the insults defamed Smyrniotis by insinuating that he lacked the abilities to perform his duties.

The lawsuit also claims the mayor used obscene language and called the lawyers “d—-.” The mayor allegedly made the following statement:

“You make some kind of secret agreement with Italians, what you are doing, you are out there measuring your d—- with the Italians seeing whose got the biggest d—, you are out there stroking your d—- over the Columbus statue, I am trying to keep Chicago Police officers from being shot and you are trying to get them shot.

The lawsuit claims she then went on to say, “My d— is bigger than yours and the Italians, I have the biggest d— in Chicago.”

The city has not commented on the lawsuit.

A second statue of Columbus was removed the same day the Grant Park statue was taken down. The second statue was removed from Arrigo Park in Little Italy. Several Italian Americans had been guarding the statue, considering it a celebration of their immigrant heritage. At the time, they accused the mayor of caving in to activists.

Columbus Day, as well as statues honoring the historical figure, has been controversial because the day has been used to commemorate the Italian explorer who claimed to have discovered the region now known as the Americas in 1492. The area was already populated by Indigenous people and some have argued that Columbus’ actions led to their genocide.

Those opposed to renaming the holiday argue that the day is meant for celebrating Italian heritage and historical contributions."

"Republican Lauren Boebert denounced separation of church and state, claims church should direct the government.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/29/republican-lauren-boebert-wins-colorado-primary-church-state,nottheonion,"The extremist Colorado Republican congresswoman Lauren Boebert won her primary on Tuesday night, shortly after attacking the separation of church and state under the US constitution.

“I’m tired of this separation of church and state junk,” she said.

A dedicated controversialist first elected in 2020, backed by Donald Trump and described by NBC News as a “Maga lightning rod”, Boebert convincingly beat Don Coram, a state senator, for the nomination to contest the midterm elections.

At one event recently Coram, 74, told voters: “My politics are very similar to my driving. To the chagrin of both my wife and my Republican colleagues, I tend to crowd the center line and sometimes I veer over a bit.”

In contrast, Boebert has heckled Joe Biden during the state of the union address; made racist attacks on Ilhan Omar, a Democrat from Minnesota; vowed to carry a gun on to the House floor; and voted to object to results in swing states in the 2020 presidential election.

Boebert beat Coram by 31 points.

On Sunday, two days before the primary and in comments first reported by the Denver Post, Boebert told a religious service: “The church is supposed to direct the government. The government is not supposed to direct the church. That is not how our founding fathers intended it.”

The first amendment to the US constitution, from 1791, says: “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.”

This is widely held to mean church and state should be separate. Critics charge that the US supreme court is now among rightwing bodies which dispute that.

This month, the conservative-dominated court has ruled that Maine cannot exclude religious schools from a tuition programme and ruled in favour of a public school football coach who lost his job for leading prayers on the field.

In the Maine case, the liberal justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote: “This court continues to dismantle the wall of separation between church and state that the framers fought to build.”

Boebert, however, said she was “tired of this separation of church and state junk that’s not in the constitution. It was in a stinking letter, and it means nothing like what they say it does”.

The “stinking letter” seemed to be one written by Thomas Jefferson to the Baptists of Danbury, Connecticut, in 1802.

The third president referred to the constitution establishing “a wall of separation between church and state”. His words have been mentioned in supreme court rulings.

Gwen Calais-Haase, a Harvard political scientist, told the Washington Post Boebert’s claim was “false, misleading and dangerous”, and said she was “extremely worried about the environment of misinformation that extremist politicians take advantage of for their own gains”.

The supreme court has also recently ruled on abortion, overturning the long established right in a ruling last week.

At the service on Sunday, Boebert said, “Look at what happened this week. This is the fruit of your labor, of your votes and of your prayers – this is your harvest.”"
"The TSA Is Improving, Only Failing ~80% Of Tests",https://onemileatatime.com/tsa-failure-rate/,nottheonion,"It continues to blow my mind how ineffective the TSA is. Back in 2015, the TSA failed 67 of 70 tests that were conducted around the nation, which involved undercover officers smuggling banned items through security. That’s right, they have a ~95% failure rate. At least up until recently, the TSA has been consistent. In July a similar test was conducted, where 16 of 17 tests were failed, which is a similar failure rate.

I simply can’t wrap my head around how this is acceptable. Earlier in the year we saw the federal government imposing ridiculous (and dangerous) bans on electronics for flights from the Middle East to the US, while for flights departing the US, 95% of weapons go undetected.

Information is now coming out about the latest tests conducted by the Department of Homeland Security, in which undercover agents brought weapons through TSA checkpoint. This time around they’re not revealing exact numbers, but rather are only giving ballpark figures.

The DHS has said that the TSA failed over half of the time in the most recent tests. CBS News reports that the TSA failed over 70% of the time, while ABC News reports that they were informed that the failure rate was in the ballpark of 80%.

Hey, if the TSA only failed 70-80% of the time, that’s a significant improvement over failing over 95% of the time, no? The chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee is quoted as saying that he found the briefing disturbing. It’s disturbing to me that after years of even worse results, this comes as any sort of a surprise, and that nothing has been done about it up until now.

The committee is pushing for the implementation of new scanners that would create 3D images of bags, though widespread implementation of these would require the TSA to get an increased budget (or maybe allocate their budget differently, but I don’t have high hopes of that being done effectively).

I hate to say it, but to me it’s a miracle that nothing major has happened after security at US airports since 9/11…"
Qatar bans one night stands during the World Cup,https://www.marca.com/en/world-cup/2022/06/21/62b1b8e446163f7e7a8b45af.html,nottheonion,"Any extramarital sexual encounter that takes place in Qatar during the 2022 World Cup could result in a seven-year jail sentence.

It is the first time that a World Cup has been held in a Gulf state, which means there are some cultural differences that many spectators may struggle to adapt to.

Qatar's Supreme Committee said in a statement that ""Qatar is a conservative country and public displays of affection are frowned upon regardless of sexual orientation"".

The Daily Star now reports that there is growing concern from UK law enforcement about the possibility of British fans facing stiff penalties for doing things that they would not think twice about.

""Sex is very much off the menu, unless you are coming as a husband and wife team,"" a police source told the Daily Star.

""There definitely will be no one-night stands at this tournament. There will be no partying at all really.

""Everyone needs to keep their heads about them, unless they want to risk being stuck in prison.

""There is essentially a sex ban in place at this year's World Cup for the first time ever. Fans need to be prepared.""

Nasser Al-Khater's interview with CNN

Concern for LGTBIQ+ visitors to Qatar

Nasser Al-Khater, chairman of Qatar's 2022 World Cup organising committee, has said that all World Cup attendees will be safe regardless of their sexual orientation or culture.

In December 2021 Al-Khater did confirm that ""homosexuality is not allowed"" in the emirate, but promises that LGTBIQ+ fans will have the right to travel to the country and attend matches.

""Qatar and the region are a lot more conservative,"" Al-Khater told CNN.

""And this is what we ask fans to respect. And we're sure that fans will respect that.

""We respect different cultures and we expect other cultures to respect ours.

""Qatar is a tolerant country. It's a welcoming country. It's a hospitable country."""
Alaska: Children served floor sealant instead of milk at summer school programme,https://news.sky.com/story/alaska-children-served-floor-sealant-instead-of-milk-at-summer-school-programme-12634713,nottheonion,"A dozen children were served floor sealant instead of milk at a day care summer programme at a school in Alaska.

Several students complained that their mouths and throats were burning shortly after being served breakfast on Tuesday, and at least one child was taken to hospital for treatment.

Police in the Alaskan state capital of Juneau are now investigating what happened, but officers do not believe ""anything criminal"" took place.

""We do want a thorough investigation of what happened, how it happened, and they're trained investigators,"" Superintendent Bridget Weiss said.

After the children complained the milk tasted bad, staff at Sitʼ Eeti Shaanax Glacier Valley Elementary School checked the container label.

""Staff immediately directed students to stop consuming the substance and removed it,"" the school district said in a statement.

A school official immediately contacted poison control and alerted parents, the statement said.

All food items including milk from a dispenser were provided by a contractor, NANA Management Services, and served by staff.

The summer day care programme is for students aged five to 12.

It was discovered the clear plastic bag of milk that had been placed in a dispenser for the children was actually a floor sealant that looks similar.

Supt Weiss said the two bags are usually both stored in cardboard boxes at a storage site off campus and somehow were moved on the same pallet.

""We don't know how that happened, but they were all put on the same pallet,"" she said.

""That pallet was delivered, and the assumption was that it was milk because that's what we thought was being delivered.""

There was no odour or chemical smell to the sealant, but school standards dictate that any chemical used must have a low ingestion risk.

The remaining sealant was removed from the school and placed in hazardous storage.

NANA Management Services said in a statement that after it learned of the incident, the company immediately dispatched a safety team to the state capital.

""We are in the midst of a comprehensive investigation that will look at every contributing factor to determine exactly what happened and to identify potential safety measures,"" the company said."
Herschel Walker defines a woman as a “Rib”,https://theblackwallsttimes.com/2022/09/27/herschel-walker-defines-a-woman-as-a-rib/,nottheonion,"Listen to this article here

Georgia Republican candidate for U.S. Senate Herschel Walker gave the biblical definition of a woman when asked to define what a woman is at a campaign event. “I know what a woman is. It’s written in the Bible. She’s from the rib of a man,” Walker boldly declared in front of an audience in Cherokee County, Ga.

Despite the fact that many Americans derive from a variety of lands with various creation stories opposing that of walkers, instead of giving a more common or scientific definition of what defines a woman in modernity, Herschel Walker chose to give the biblical definition from the Book of Genesis.

“Then the LORD God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man,” the Judeo-Christian text reads in the second chapter.

In addition, the candidate also promoted anti-transgender views during his campaign speech.

“Men shouldn’t be in women’s sports. That’s easy to know,” Herschel said. “There’s man, and there’s wo-man.” That’s it. There ain’t another. So quit trying to create it.”

Florida still won’t explain why it rejected math textbooks,http://www.tampabay.com/news/education/2022/04/18/florida-still-wont-specify-why-it-rejected-math-textbooks/,nottheonion,"TALLAHASSEE — Days after rejecting dozens of math textbooks for including what the state Department of Education claimed were “indoctrinating concepts,” Florida officials on Monday continued to refuse requests for examples.

The material is “proprietary,” Gov. Ron DeSantis said during a news conference.

The lack of information caused a buzz over the weekend, with the state’s announcement capturing attention nationally as the latest flame in ongoing classroom culture wars.

Local school officials, publishers and other interested parties scrambled for specifics and were left scratching their heads as to what exactly the state was talking about when it said math textbooks contained “prohibited topics,” including references to critical race theory.

“Textbook selection has always been a highly politicized area,” said Christopher Finan, executive director of the National Coalition Against Censorship. “It is not a surprise that textbooks are being attacked. It just seems so bizarre that they managed to find CRT in math textbooks. It is direct from satire.”

Several publishers whose books were rejected did not respond to requests for comment. Richard Weir, spokesperson for publishing giant Savvas Learning (formerly Pearson), said his company has had “a long and successful track record” with Florida education officials and worked to ensure its materials would meet the state’s new standards.

“Like many other companies that submitted bids to the Florida DOE, Savvas has been notified that some of our math programs developed specifically for Florida have not been recommended at this time. Once we obtain additional information from the state as to the specific reasons why, Savvas will work toward an appropriate resolution,” he said via email.

As the nation talked about Florida’s unusual textbook move, DeSantis administration officials doubled down. Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez appeared on Fox & Friends Monday morning to argue that publishers are conspiring to indoctrinate children.

“What we’ve seen is a systematic attempt by these publishers to infiltrate our children’s education by embedding topics such as CRT,” said Nuñez, who characterized the state’s book vetting process as “very transparent.”

A few hours later, DeSantis told reporters at a news conference that the state has not released specific examples from the rejected books because the text is considered “proprietary information.”

“I would like it to be released, but I also respect the process,” he told reporters.

His comments appear to clash with the intent of a measure that DeSantis signed into law a couple of weeks ago. That law aims to bring more transparency into Florida school districts’ book selection process. It says districts must provide access to all materials “before the district school board takes any official action on such materials.”

The lack of information has left many local school officials scrambling for clarity as they prepare to select instructional materials for their classrooms. Districts don’t have to purchase books from the state-approved list, but they attempt to have materials that meet the state’s academic expectations.

Miami-Dade County Public Schools, Florida’s largest district, said it was “awaiting feedback from the state as to why the titles were rejected.”

“We’re trying to understand what’s going on (and) what the issue at hand is,” said Karla Hernandez-Mats, United Teachers of Dade president. “This is smoke and mirrors. This is the shiny object. No one is complaining about math books, but (state GOP leaders) are turning it into an issue.”

In Orange and Pinellas counties, the information matters because they have already selected their new math book for the 2022-23 school year. None of the books those districts picked for elementary math classes were on the state approved list.

“I’ve never seen a K-5 list of only one selection,” said Kevin Hendrick, chief academic officer for Pinellas schools. “It was a little surprising to not see the textbooks that our teachers chose.”

The state has a textbook adoption cycle that rotates through subjects every six years. The process is not new, and it is not the first time books have not been included in a state-approved list. What is unusual, state officials said, is that 41 percent of the books — 54 of the 132 textbooks publishers submitted — failed to meet “Florida’s lofty standards for math instruction.”

Hendrick said the district’s review of the books did not reveal any critical race theory in the lessons. The inclusion of social-emotional learning might be inferred, he said, because publishers are following state standards for helping students see math as approachable and relevant.

Social-emotional learning, also known by its acronym SEL, is based on the idea that emotional skills are crucial to academic performance in school.

“I don’t know how those are being implemented in math problems,” said Morgan Polikoff, an associate professor of education with the University of Southern California’s Rossier School of Education. “To me the onus is on the state to provide evidence of what they’re talking about.”

Lea Mitchell, director of leading and learning for Pasco County schools, said her district decided not to choose an elementary math series for the coming year because of some of the reasons the state cited for rejecting them.

“Our concern was the same about publishers not being able to adequately adapt elementary textbooks to meet the B.E.S.T. standards in the time given,” she said.

But not knowing what officials are referring to when they criticize content as “indoctrination” could prove problematic for educators as they attempt to find materials for their classrooms. State law says that districts may spend up to 50 percent of their state allocation for books that are not on department adoption lists.

“If they want to point it out to us, that is what I think is very worrisome,” Mitchell said.

Stephana Ferrell of Orange County is a leader of the Florida Freedom to Read Project. The group has been fighting efforts to remove books from school libraries in several counties.

Ferrell acknowledged the state’s authority to set guidelines for textbooks and curriculum is much stricter than determining what goes into libraries. She was not surprised about the direction the state took on math books, suggesting it advances the DeSantis narrative that Floridians cannot trust public education.

DeSantis “scores easy points with the base and he looks like a hero for stopping the bad guys yet again,” Ferrell said.

Jeremy Young, senior manager of PEN America’s Free Expression and Education program, said in a statement that the textbook decision “raises serious concerns about whether these decisions are being made based on pedagogy or politics.”

In the past year, DeSantis and Florida Republicans have made no secret of their disagreements with local school officials. Mask mandates, classroom instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity in some primary grades and restrictions on race-related topics have all been targets, and been part of a broad GOP effort to energize its base ahead of the midterm election.

At DeSantis’ request, the State Board of Education last year also banned lessons that deal with critical race theory, an academic concept focused on the idea that racism is systemic and entwined in American society.

After reading the department’s announcement, Ferrell said she went back to the Orange County district website to review the online versions of its recommended math textbooks, which were made public because of state requirements.

She said she found a few examples where lessons focused on such ideas as the statistical probability of being arrested by race, based on existing data. If that’s what the state is talking about, Ferrell said, her group disputes the definition of “indoctrination.”

“Indoctrination is not having it in the book but removing it from the conversation,” she said. “We want our children to go and be educated in a school that looks like the real world, that acts like the real world, that challenges their beliefs.”

State Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith, D-Orlando, said he worries that the Department of Education’s action on the math books might foreshadow how it will approach other subjects, including how it carries out HB 1557 on the instruction of sexual orientation and gender identity. Critics have called the new law vague, leaving decisions about what may and may not be included to the department.

The state will be reviewing social studies textbooks next year.

“The Department of Education has been politicized by Ron DeSantis, by his appointees and by Moms for Liberty,” Smith said. “Their assessment of what is and is not appropriate for students is totally out of sync with a majority of Floridians.”

Evangelical Christian furries are worried they’ll be targeted for their faith,https://onlysky.media/hemant-mehta/evangelical-christian-furries-are-worried-theyll-be-targeted-for-their-faith/?__vfz=medium%3Dstandalone_content_recirculation_with_ads,nottheonion,"Reading Time: 3 minutes

Here’s a problem you never knew existed: Christian furries are worried people will come after them… for being Christians.

That’s the premise of a Religion News Service article by Riley Farrell, who spoke with leaders of the Christian Furry Fellowship (“Bringing the Good News to the Furry Fandom”) about the two things they feel obligated to hide from people in their lives: their faith and their fursonas.

It’s one thing to hide behind a costume where you can let your avatar represent you. But when you feel most at home in a furry subculture that’s more atheist/agnostic than Christian, and very welcoming to and accepting of LGBTQ people, what happens when you’re a conservative Christ-follower who believes most of the furries you hang out with are Hell-bound?

… Christians in the furry community are cautious about who knows about both their furry and faithful selves. Christian furries interviewed for this story, including leaders of the group that calls itself the Christian Furry Fellowship, asked to be anonymous, fearing “doxxing” from within the largely secular furry community for their Christian identity and ostracization from their professional lives for their furry hobby. “My furry friendships are a blessing,” said one CFF organizer with a red fox fursona who asked to be called “F.” “And for that reason, I am sad to see so much grief within the fandom that could be helped by the knowledge of the Lord.”

Yeah, spare a thought for the happy furries who need more Jesus in their lives…

I’m having a hard time feeling sympathy for the Christians who may be furries, but who also have an additional goal of spreading their beliefs in a community that already has to avoid the wrath of Christians in every other aspect of their lives.

The type of people who often adopt fursonas and identify as LGBTQ have to deal with legal, personal, and moral attacks from Christians who wield incredible power. Yet these conservative Christian furries, who have the kind of privilege the rest of us can only dream of, want to come into this community in order to evangelize. And they have the audacity to whine about how hard things are for them?!

Please.

The furries won’t dox them for being Christian. They respect privacy. But you can bet good money that conservative Christians will keep spreading lies about furries. (They already have.)

These Christians ought to be asking why they’re so unwelcome in this subculture.

This isn’t just theoretical. Even though the Christian Furry Fellowship doesn’t force members to adopt any anti-LGBTQ faith statement, it’s certainly implicit in their beliefs:

… Like many conservative Christians, its members believe that engaging in same-sex sexual relationships is wrong; having homosexual feelings alone is not. Furries who disagree with this stance can still join, S said, as long as they abide by the group’s rules.

They love gay people… as long as they never do anything gay. It’s the same policy many evangelical churches have adopted in order to distance themselves from anti-LGBTQ extremists… even though it’s hardly any better. LGBTQ people and their allies know exactly where those church members stand.

One of the goals of CFF is to “present a different face of their faith to their fellow furries.” But when they hold bigoted beliefs, how do they expect to make inroads? Furries may accept these Christians, but they do so in spite of their beliefs, not because of them.

In a way, these Christians are like the Log Cabin Republicans who are fully convinced they’re liberalizing the Republican Party on the issue of LGBTQ rights, only to realize (long after everyone else) that they’re a joke to the very people they’ve been trying to change.

Instead of trying to make the furry community more accepting of Christianity, the Christians should spend their time making evangelical churches more inclusive on matters of sexual orientation and gender identity.

I doubt it’ll work, but at least the furries will be left alone.

(Correction: I initially wrote that the only goal of Christian furries was to spread their faith in these communities. That’s not accurate since they may genuinely be furries with a secondary goal. I’ve corrected the piece to reflect that. Thank you to everyone who pointed that out.)"

NVIDIA hacks the attackers

Vx-underground, a group sharing samples of the malware and viruses, has reported on Twitter that the supposed NVIDIA ransomware attack was performed by a South American group called LAPU$.

Supposed messages from the hacking group, Source: @vx-underground

The group allegedly performed a ransomware attack on NVIDIA internal servers and has exfiltrated over 1TB of data. This claim has not been confirmed by NVIDIA, as the company has only confirmed it is investigating the incident.

Yesterday Bloomberg citing their own sources confirmed that NVIDIA was indeed attacked by a ransomware attack, which partially confirms the news from vx-underground.

The most interesting part of this story is that NVIDIA allegedly hacked the group back by trying to encrypt the stolen data, however, the group has made a copy of it in a virtual-machine environment which means such a counter-attack measure will be unsuccessful.

It appears that the hacking group gained access to employees’ email accounts, which may explain why NVIDIA had trouble with their mailing systems for the past 2 days. The group also posted source code from NVIDIA drivers, but the true scope of this attack is yet unknown.

The Emmett Till Antilynching Act was sponsored by a bipartisan group of Senators including Democrat Cory Booker of New Jersey and Republican Tim Scott of South Carolina. The Emmett Till Antilynching Act makes conspiracy to commit certain pre-existing hate crimes illegal and punishable by up to 30 years in prison if the crimes result in death or serious bodily injury. It amends the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act and prior hate crime laws to define lynching as any bias-motivated offense which results in death or bodily injury. The bill is named after a 14-year-old African American boy who was lynched by two white men after being accused of whistling at a white woman at a grocery store.

""Lynching is a longstanding and uniquely American weapon of racial terror that has for decades been used to maintain the white hierarchy,"" Senator Bobby Rush of Illinois said in a statement Monday evening. ""Unanimous Senate passage of the Emmett Till Anti-Lynching Act sends a clear and emphatic message that our nation will no longer ignore this shameful chapter of our history and that the full force of the U.S. federal government will always be brought to bear against those who commit this heinous act."" According to Senator Rush, the absence of anti-lynching laws has meant 99% of lynching perpetrators escaped punishment.

While the bill passed the Senate unanimously, it faced some dissent in the House of Representatives. The House voted 422-3 to approve the Emmett Till Antilynching Act. Republican Representatives Andrew Clyde of Georgia, Thomas Massie of Kentucky; and Chip Roy of Texas voted against the legislation. Representative Chip Roy opposed the bill because he claimed it was “an effort to advance a woke agenda under the guise of correcting racial injustice.” Representative Thomas Massie stated he opposed the federal bill because “[t]he Constitution specifies only a handful of federal crimes, and leaves the rest to individual states to prosecute.” Representative Andrew Clyde called the Antilynching Act a “duplicative federal law” and argued other federal laws punished hate crimes.

From 1882 to 1968, 4,743 lynchings occurred in the U.S., according to records maintained by NAACP. Other accounts, including the Equal Justice Initiative's extensive report on lynching, count slightly different numbers, but it's impossible to know for certain how many lynchings occurred because there was no formal tracking. Many historians believe the true number is underreported."
Gov. Ron DeSantis claims credit for sending 2 planes carrying migrants to Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts,https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/14/politics/marthas-vineyard-massachusetts-migrants-planes/index.html,nottheonion,
Mcdonald’s and wendy’s sued for $50m over misleading ads that make burgers look bigger,https://www.diyphotography.net/mcdonalds-and-wendys-sued-for-50m-over-misleading-ads-that-make-burgers-look-bigger/,nottheonion,"One would say we’re all used to the fact that burgers always look way more appetizing in photos than they do in life. However, a New York man recently filed a lawsuit over those misleading ads we’re all so accustomed to.

The man, named Justin Chimenti, sued McDonald’s and Wendy’s for “unfair and deceptive trade practices.” He’s seeking $50 million in damages for himself and everyone else who thought that burgers actually look like they do in the ads.

According to the lawsuit, the companies’ ads are “unfair and financially damaging consumers as they are receiving food that is much lower in value than what is being promised.” It also states that the burgers of both companies are at least 15% larger in the ads than they are in real life. If I may add, the ones in ads are also probably inedible thanks to the “makeup” they get for the shoot. Anyway, the lawsuit claims that this kind of “misleading” advertising is “especially concerning now that inflation, food, and meat prices are very high and many consumers, especially lower income consumers, are struggling financially.”

According to the BBC, both chains failed to immediately comment on the case. After checking their socials, I also didn’t spot anything related to the lawsuit. Still, Chimenti is obviously convinced he could get millions of dollars, but Mark Bartholomew disagrees. He is a law professor at the University of Buffalo in New York, and he calls this “an uphill battle for the plaintiff to prove. He added that “fast food companies could likely argue that the public expects some exaggeration in a marketing campaign,” and that this will end with a settlement.

If you thought this case sounds familiar, that’s because it kinda is. Just a few weeks ago, a woman sued Burger King over the same claim. I’m still a little shocked, though, that people believe those ads. A woman even sued McDonald’s last year claiming that their photos were so appetizing that they made her break her lent.

On the other hand, this probably does fall under false advertising and filing a lawsuit is legit. Still, I’m also sure there’s no way for Chimenti to win $50 million, it’s more likely that it will just end in a settlement. What do you think?

Texas Republican Party passes resolution denying legitimacy of Biden's victory in presidential election,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-republican-party-passes-resolution-denying-legitimacy-of-bidens-victory-in-presidential-election/,nottheonion,"The Texas Republican Party officially rejected the results of the 2020 presidential election over the weekend, passing a resolution in its platform that falsely blames election fraud in five battleground states for President Joe Biden's victory over former President Donald Trump. The resolution refers to Mr. Biden as ""acting"" president.

""We reject the certified results of the 2020 Presidential election, and we hold that acting President Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. was not legitimately elected by the people of the United States,"" the resolution reads. It claims that the elections in five states violated Articles 1 and 2 of the Constitution because ""various secretaries of state illegally circumvented their state legislatures in conducting their elections in multiple ways, including by allowing ballots to be received after November 3, 2020.""

Reviews of the vote tallies and various recounts did not change the outcome of any state's election. Officials including Trump's Attorney General William Barr have repeatedly rejected claims that there was widespread election fraud. The former president and his allies waged dozens of unsuccessful legal battles to try and deliver Mr. Trump a second term in the White House after Mr. Biden was declared the winner, including multiple rejected appeals to the Supreme Court. Despite this, Mr. Trump persists in his false election fraud claims. His actions are currently under scrutiny from a House select committee tasked with investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and related efforts to overturn the 2020 election.

Texas Republicans also passed a number of other far-right resolutions in the platform, demonstrating the most conservative activists' strength in the state party. The platform calls for the complete abolition of abortion, prohibiting ""the teaching of sex education, sexual health, or sexual choice or identity in any public school in any grade whatsoever,"" and refers to homosexuality as ""an abnormal lifestyle choice."" The platform also calls for Obergefell v. Hodges, the 2015 Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide, to be overturned.

The platform notes that ""Texas retains the right to secede from the United States."" One resolution called for a referendum ""in the 2023 general election for the people of Texas to determine whether or not the State of Texas should reassert its status as an independent nation,"" the platform reads. Another called for the United States to withdraw from the United Nations.

Convention attendees also codified their opposition to the bipartisan gun bill that's being negotiated and rebuked the state's own Republican Senator John Cornyn for his work on the bill. When Cornyn addressed the convention, he was met with loud boos. The senior senator defended the framework of the gun control legislation, declaring, ""I will not under any circumstance support new restrictions for law-abiding gun owners. That will always be my red line. And despite what some of you may have heard, the framework that we are working on is consistent with that red line.""

He also pointed out the measures he has fought against in the legislation: ""Democrats push for an assault weapons ban. I said no. They tried to get a new three-week mandatory waiting period for all gun purchases. I said no. Universal background checks. Magazine bans; licensing requirements. The list goes on and on and on. And I said no, no, 1000 times no!""

The gun debate in Congress comes after a wave of mass shootings across the country, including one in Uvalde, Texas that left 19 students and two teachers dead. That shooting came just 10 days after a racially motivated mass shooting in Buffalo, where 10 Black people were killed in a grocery store.

In their resolution, the Texas Republicans inveighed against potential age restrictions, stating without citing any evidence that ""those under 21 are most likely to be victims of violent crime and thus most likely to need to defend themselves."" The resolution also said ""red-flag"" laws violate citizens' due process, and ""all gun control is a violation of the Second Amendment and our God given rights.""

Though supportive of the Second Amendment, the platform calls for other amendments to be eliminated. One portion of the platform calls for the repeal of the Seventeenth Amendment, which allows citizens to vote for senators rather than have them be appointed by state legislatures. Another calls for the federal income tax, established in the Sixteenth Amendment, to be eliminated. Constitutional amendments require two-thirds of each chamber of Congress, or two-thirds of states, to be proposed, as well as three-fourths of state legislatures for ratification."
China warns Asian nations to avoid being used as 'chess pieces' by big powers,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/china-asean-wang-yi-chess-pieces-2801576,nottheonion,"JAKARTA: China's foreign minister Wang Yi warned on Monday (Jul 11) in a policy speech in the Indonesian capital that countries should avoid being used as ""chess pieces"" by major powers in a region that he said was at risk of being reshaped by geopolitical factors.

Addressing the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) secretariat in Jakarta, Wang, who was speaking through a translator, said many countries in the region were under pressure to take sides.

""We should insulate this region from geopolitical calculations … from being used as chess pieces from major power rivalry and from coercion,"" he said, adding: ""The future of our region should be in our own hands.""

Southeast Asia has long been an area of geopolitical friction between major powers given its strategic importance, with countries in the region now wary of being caught in the middle of US-China rivalry.

Heightening tensions, China claims almost the entire South China Sea as its territory based on what it says are historical maps, putting it at odds with some ASEAN countries which say the claims are inconsistent with international law.

Wang's speech comes just days after he attended a G20 foreign ministers' meeting in Bali and amid intense Chinese diplomacy that has seen him make a string of stops across the region in recent weeks.

On the sidelines of the G20, Wang held a five-hour meeting with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken with both describing their first in-person talks since October as ""candid"".

Wang said on Monday he had told Blinken both sides should discuss the establishment of rules for positive interactions and to jointly uphold regionalism in the Asia-Pacific.

""The core elements are to support ASEAN centrality, uphold the existing regional corporation framework, respect each other's legitimate rights and interests in the Asia-Pacific instead of aiming to antagonise or contain the other side,"" Wang said.

Responding to a question about Taiwan after his speech, Wang said Washington ""by distorting and hollowing out the One China policy, is trying to play the Taiwan card to disrupt and contain China's development"".

Tensions between Beijing and Taipei have escalated in recent months as China's military conducted repeated air missions over the Taiwan Strait, the waterway separating the island from China.

China considers Taiwan its ""sacred"" territory and has never renounced the use of force to ensure eventual unification.

Washington says it remains committed to its One China policy and does not encourage independence for Taiwan, but the United States is required to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself under its US Taiwan Relations Act.

""The two sides across the (Taiwan) Strait will enjoy peaceful development. But when the one-China principle is arbitrarily challenged or even sabotaged, there will be dark clouds or even ferocious storms across the strait,"" Wang said."
Iowa Republicans Call for Teachers to be Monitored by Cameras,https://themountain.news/news/iowa-republicans-call-for-teachers-to-be-monitored-by-cameras,nottheonion,"“History teaches but has no students.” Conservatives, the self-proclaimed defenders of tradition and the America of old are cracking down on American history. Conservatives from the Atlantic to the Pacific are fighting the teaching of “Critical Race Theory.” For many people, it is a school of thought focusing on how material conditions disparately impact people of color and that those disparate conditions stem from systematic racism over centuries. To conservatives, it is indoctrinating white children that they are evil and tainted with some original sin that obligates them to live in shame. For conservatives, Critical Race Theory is but one form of a broader conspiracy that liberals are trying to indoctrinate America’s youth into becoming Marxists. While Critical Race Theory academically refers to a specific school of thought, the goal posts have been moved to the point that teaching the most basic truths of American history, that this country was built on slavery, has become a part of this academic subject. In another episode in Republicans' mistrust of the education system, Iowa republicans have called for cameras to be installed in every public school classroom in the state, ostensibly to “showcase the great work our teachers do.”

“Similar to a body camera on a policeman, a camera takes away the ‘he said, she said’ or ‘he said,' ’type argument and lets them know ‘hey, we are doing a good job.’ It takes that argument away.” Iowa Republican Norlin Mommsen explained. According to the bill, any teacher who “obstructs, disconnects, or otherwise causes a camera or online site not to function” could be fined a part of their weekly salary. The wording of “otherwise causes a camera or online site not to function” implies that if the cameras stop working or malfunction (which is common with any technology) the teacher could still be found liable and be fined a part of their salary. If a school superintendent fails to ensure this system of surveillance works, they too could be fined part of their weekly salary. Funding for the cameras would be paid by school foundation aid overseen by the state of Iowa. The only exceptions to the cameras would be classrooms meant for special education and gymnasiums. Iowa, like many states, is struggling with teacher shortages as a consequence of the pandemic, virtual learning, and stagnating wages.

Iowa’s teachers expressed immediate and adamant opposition to the camera bill. “The inappropriateness of belief that there should be continual videotaping in a classroom is something that should not even be considered,"" said Mike Beranek, the president of the Iowa State Education Association. Becky Pringle, leader of the largest educators union in the United States was similarly opposed: “Instead of wasting public funds on monitoring equipment, we should employ additional qualified professionals, reduce class sizes, and provide more programming that helps students acquire the skills they need.” Both houses of the Iowa government are controlled by Republicans and Iowa’s governor, Kim Reynolds, is a Republican. Governor Reynolds has previously signed laws focused on targeting the teaching of critical race theory and other concepts in government diversity training and classroom curriculum when she signed a bill that banned the teaching that the United States or the state of Iowa is fundamentally or systemically racist or sexist. That law was copied almost verbatim from a Trump administration executive order.

The most obvious reason why this is a horrible idea could be spotted by anyone who has worked a job. Who enjoys being watched while they work, wondering if those eyes over your shoulder are disapproving of your day's work? Having live cameras in a public school classroom is sure to make the job of being a teacher only more stressful, disenchanting, and miserable. The average American has work, chores, a never-ending list of errands that take up their day. Yet, at the same time, there is an army of activist parents who have nothing better to do but stare at their students in 5th-period social studies and micromanage teachers and students alike. It would be miserable for the students almost as much as the teacher. God forbid a teacher slip the words “slavery”, “racism”, or “systematic” and that Mom will be dialing the principal to vent her outrage. Then comes the call for that teacher to go sit down with the administration and explain themselves like they are a criminal. Making teachers feel like they are perpetually being watched is an extreme example of how to chill freedoms. Conservatives have stopped bemoaning about the world turning into 1984 and pivoted to speeding up that process.

Similar legal attacks on American history are appearing across America. A bill in Oklahoma would ban the teaching that “[t]hat one race is the unique oppressor in the institution of slavery” and “[t]hat another race is the unique victim in the institution of slavery.” In that bill, entire school districts could see their state funding slashed for endorsing these radical and extreme ideas. Republicans control both houses in Iowa, A task force looking into claims of critical race theory “indoctrination"" in Idaho schools is seeking records from the Boise School District, a move critics say is aimed at intimidating teachers. The Alabama State Department of Education announced plans to introduce a resolution banning the study of critical race theory in public schools. Community meetings over the school district have gone from treatment for Insomnia to screaming matches between parents, teachers, and members of the community. While not new to America, a new wave of historical revisionism is coming to America, ornamented in the flag and cross."

"Jeffrey Dahmer Halloween costumes are hurtful to victims’ families, victim’s mother says",https://wreg.com/news/nation-and-world/jeffrey-dahmer-halloween-costumes-are-hurtful-to-victims-families-victims-mother-says/,nottheonion,"(WFLA) — Shirley Hughes, the mother of one of murderer Jeffrey Dahmer’s victims, is calling out the use of Dahmer’s image for Halloween costumes this year as being exploitative, according to a report by TMZ.

In an interview with the outlet, Hughes said it was triggering to see people dress like the man who took her son, Tony Hughes, away.

Tony Hughes was a deaf man who was murdered by Dahmer.

Dahmer was eventually convicted of killing 17 men between the 1970s and 1990s. His other horrific deeds included sexual assault, the mutilation of his victims, and sex crimes involving minors.

Authorities would not find out what happened to Hughes until they found a skull in Dahmer’s apartment that matched the victim’s dental records.

Controversy over media depictions of Dahmer’s life resurfaced this year following the release of a Netflix series detailing the murders. One of the episodes of the series even focuses on Tony Hughes and his deadly encounter with Dahmer.

(AP Photo/Morry Gash)

Part of the controversy involves the races of Dahmer’s victims, who were mostly Black or other minorities. Critics of law enforcement have said that this racial imbalance contributed to Dahmer’s ability to carry out the murders for so long.

In an interview with the Guardian, Shirley Hughes said it was difficult to talk about her son’s murder and to see people make stories about the victims and their families.

“I don’t see how they can use our names and put stuff out like that out there,” she told the Guardian.

Eric Perry, whose cousin Errol Lindsey was murdered by Dahmer, said Lindsey’s family only found out about the series after it came out.

Because the information in Dahmer’s case is public record, Netflix was not required to consult with the victim’s families. But Hughes and other relatives of the victims have called out the company for profiting off their trauma.

“So when they say they’re doing this ‘with respect to the victims’ or ‘honoring the dignity of the families,’ no one contacts them,” Perry wrote on Twitter. “My cousins wake up every few months at this point with a bunch of calls and messages and they know there’s another Dahmer show. It’s cruel.”

In a report from Insider, Lindsey’s sister Rita Isbell said she was never contacted about the show, even though the series recreated her emotional victim impact statement where she shouted at Dahmer for killing her brother.

“I feel like Netflix should’ve asked if we mind or how we felt about making it,” Isbell said in her essay published by Insider. “They didn’t ask me anything. They just did it.”"
"Joan Jett on Ted Nugent: ""He s**t his pants so he didn't have to go to the army""",https://www.loudersound.com/news/joan-jett-on-ted-nugent-he-st-his-pants-so-he-didnt-have-to-go-to-the-army/,nottheonion,"Joan Jett has hit back at Ted Nugent after he poured scorn on her inclusion on a list of 100 Great Guitarists compiled by Rolling Stone editor David Fricke (opens in new tab) 12 years ago.

Taking a brief break from railing against all the stuff he traditionally rails against in his frequent video broadcasts, Nugent singles Jett out for particular attention, saying, ""So I just mentioned some killer, monster guitar players, huh? Some of the best that ever lived. When you see the Rolling Stone magazine list of greatest guitar players, they list Joan Jett but not Tommy Shaw [of Styx].”

""How do you list the top 100 guitar players and not list Derek St. Holmes?,"" he drones on, as if his viewers might still be awake. ""How do you do that? You do that by lying. The same way you get Grandmaster Flash in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. You do that by lying. You have to be a liar.”

As well as being ""a liar"", someone considering adding Jett to such a list would have to have ""shit for brains"" and be ""a soulless, soulless prick"", Nugent continued, apparently still furious about a personal opinion someone held a dozen years ago.

Now Jett has hit back at Nugent, who wasn't included in Fricke's list. In an interview with The NME (opens in new tab), she asks, ""Is his implication that he should be on the list instead of me? Well, that's just typical – it's what I've dealt with my whole life, being written off.

""Ted Nugent has to live with being Ted Nugent. He has to be in that body, so that's punishment enough. He's not a tough guy. He plays tough guy, but this is the guy who shit his pants – literally – so he didn't have to go in the Army.""

In a 1977 interview with High Times, Nugent claimed that in the days leading up to his draft board physical exam he'd taken meth, stopped eating food with any nutritional value, and defecated in his pants.

""I just had chips, Pepsi, beer – stuff I never touched – buttered poop, little jars of Polish sausages, and I’d drink the syrup. I was this side of death. Then, a week before, I stopped going to the bathroom. I did it in my pants, poop, piss, the whole shot. My pants got crusted up.

""So I went in, and those guys in uniform couldn’t believe the smell. They were ridiculin’ me and pushin’ me around and I was cryin’, but all the time I was laughin’ to myself.""

Nugent later distanced himself from his remarks, telling The Independent in 2006, ""You've got to realise that these interviewers would arrive with glazed eyes and I would make stories up. I never did crystal meth. And I never pooped my pants."""
"Lawmakers Drink Raw Milk To Celebrate Its Legality, Become Immediately Sick",https://modernfarmer.com/2016/03/west-virginia-lawmakers-raw-milk-sick/,nottheonion,"WSAZ, a local news affiliate in West Virginia, got a tip that might make legalizing raw milk just a little bit harder. Last week, West Virginia governor Earl Ray Tomblin signed into law a bill that makes it legal to drink (but not sell) raw milk throughout the state, despite pressures from the dairy industry and from the FDA, which actually testified that raw milk is unsafe. However, the law doesn’t go into effect for 30 days.

According to the tipster, who remains anonymous, state representative Scott Cadle (Republican of West Virginia’s 13th district) brought in some raw milk to celebrate the legalization. Cadle, says the tipster, handed out samples to various other representatives. And now, verifies WSAZ, several West Virginia lawmakers are severely sick to their stomachs.

Pat McGeehan (Republican of West Virginia’s first district), one of the afflicted, says that while he did drink the raw milk, that a stomach bug is going around and that he does not believe his illness to be related to the milk.

Although there isn’t proof – and we all know that correlation doesn’t equal causation – there’s certainly the possibility that the raw milk consumption and the illnesses are related. Raw milk is not pasteurized, or heated up to a temperature of 140 degrees F for 20 minutes, a process that kills off bacteria that can cause foodborne illness, including Salmonella, listeria, and E. coli. The Center for Disease Control says that thousands of illnesses, and two deaths, can be linked conclusively to consumption of raw dairy products in the period between 1998 and 2011. The Cornell University food science department, one of the premier such institutions in the world, puts it simply: “We recommend pasteurization of milk intended for consumption by humans.”

There are substantial efforts to allow the sale and consumption of raw milk, partly from entities who claim that the pasteurization process is unnecessary thanks to modern sanitary requirements, that the process kills beneficial bacteria and vitamins, and that raw milk can have effects ranging from healthier gut flora to decreased risk of cancer. The West Virginia lawmakers involved here are a slightly different breed; they mostly push for legal raw milk out of a libertarian instinct that citizens should be able to decide what they eat and drink.

“There definitely shouldn’t be a law against allowing people to do what they want within the framework of the rule of law,” McGeehan told WSAZ. “Just be careful.” It’s unclear how careful McGeehan was when he drank a cup of raw milk handed to him by a co-worker."
Money unites: Republicans and Democrats find rare bipartisanship over trading stocks,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/22/us-politicians-trading-stocks-bipartisan-idea,nottheonion,"Nancy Pelosi probably did not expect to set off such a firestorm with her use of three words: free market economy.

When the House speaker was asked in December whether she supports proposals to ban members and their spouses from trading individual stocks, she said no. “We’re a free market economy,” Pelosi said. “They should be able to participate in that.”

But Pelosi’s comment sparked ire among government ethics experts and editorial boards, who argued that lawmakers’ ability to glean information from classified briefings and stakeholder meetings raised the possibility of insider trading.

Some critics also noted that Pelosi’s husband, Paul, recently netted a gain of more than $5m from trading stocks of Alphabet, Google’s parent company.

In the face of backlash, Pelosi has changed her tune on the stock-trading issue, but her hesitation highlighted an uncomfortable truth about how Congresshas responded to the proposal.

Despite wide public support for banning lawmakers from trading stocks, members of both parties have expressed anxiety about the idea: a rare moment of bipartisanship in a divided America, but one whose subject – stock-trading politicians – is unlikely to please many voters.

Government watchdog groups warn that if Congress fails to act on this issue, it will only intensify many Americans’ concern over how money has tainted their country’s political institutions.

The debate over banning members’ stock-trading has been reinvigorated in recent months, after a string of high-profile controversies at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. In February 2020, Republican senator Richard Burr sold hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of stock before the market suffered a severe setback the next month. While he was overseeing those valuable stock trades, Burr was also publicly downplaying the threat of the virus. The justice department investigated Burr and three of his Senate colleagues – Republicans Kelly Loeffler and James Inhofe and Democrat Dianne Feinstein – for possible insider trading, but ultimately no charges were filed.

In response to the outcry over those controversies, both Democrats and Republicans have proposed bills to crack down on members’ stock-trading. One bill, introduced by Democratic senators Jon Ossoff and Mark Kelly, would require members, their spouses and their dependent children to place their stock portfolios in a blind trust controlled by an outside party. Republican senator Josh Hawley has proposed a similar bill, although his legislation does not cover dependent children and would not fine members’ salaries for violations, as the Ossoff-Kelly bill would.

Over in the House, Democrat Abigail Spanberger and Republican Chip Roy have introduced a similar bill to the Ossoff-Kelly proposal, and more than 50 members have signed on as co-sponsors to the separate Ban Conflicted Trading Act. That bill, which was first introduced by Democrat Raja Krishnamoorthi, would ban members and senior congressional staffers from trading individual stocks.

“It has really gotten to a point where it’s getting a little bit too difficult for the rest of Congress to ignore,” Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a co-sponsor of Krishnamoorthi’s bill, said at a town hall on Tuesday. “The fact of the matter is, we shouldn’t be able to day-trade the companies whose regulation and whose hearings and whose industries and business is before Congress.”

A majority of Americans agree with her. According to a January poll from the progressive firm Data for Progress, 67% of US voters say lawmakers should be banned from trading stocks. Another recent survey, conducted by the conservative advocacy group Convention of States Action, found that 76% of voters believe lawmakers and their spouses have an “unfair advantage” in the stock market.

It is illegal for members of Congress, or any American, to engage in insider trading. However, insider trading is very difficult to prove, so in 2012, Congress passed the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (Stock) Act to address concerns about lawmakers’ financial activities. The law prohibits members from using information gained through work for their own personal profit, and it requires them to disclose stock trades within 45 days.

Both Democratic and Republican lawmakers have pointed to the existing legislation to argue against banning members from trading stocks. Republican congressman Pete Sessions has described a ban as unnecessary, while one of his Democratic colleagues, Elaine Luria, attacked the proposal as “bullshit”.

“Why would you assume that members of Congress are going to be inherently bad or corrupt? We already have the Stock Act that requires people to report stock trades,” Luria told Punchbowl News earlier this month. “So I’m very strongly opposed to any legislation like that.”

Advocates for a stock-trading ban were quick to note that Luria and her husband own millions of dollars worth of stocks in Facebook, Netflix and Apple, among other companies.

“Honestly, the stock trades by members of Congress just smell bad … Regardless of which party is doing it, it just doesn’t look good,” said RL Miller, the political director of Climate Hawks Vote. Responding to Luria’s comments specifically, Miller added: “Members of Congress expecting that they don’t prioritize companies in which they’re invested is bullshit.”

Miller’s group was one of 18 progressive organizations that signed on to a letter urging Congress to hold a hearing on banning stock trades, arguing that the Stock Act and other existing laws “have not served as a sufficient deterrent to this problem”.

Enforcement of the Stock Act also appears to have been spotty at best over the past 10 years. No one has ever been prosecuted under the law, and an investigation by Business Insider found that at least 55 members of Congress and 182 senior congressional staffers were late in filing their stock trades in 2020 and 2021. A late filing is supposed to be punished with a $200 fine that increases with subsequent offenses, but Congress does not keep any public record of such fines, and it’s unclear how often they are collected.

“The teeth behind the Stock Act are basically non-existent,” said Dylan Hedtler-Gaudette, government affairs manager at the Project on Government Oversight. “We’re seeing that reporting and disclosure do not actually act as any kind of a deterrent to doing things that look, at the very least, pretty sketchy.”

Government watchdog groups also argue that the Stock Act is now somewhat outdated. They say the legislation does not properly account for how lawmakers can use the 24-hour news cycle and social media platforms to affect markets and specific companies’ share prices.

“We have seen countless examples of how members – not just as a body but individual members – can influence the stock market with a range of tools at their disposal,” said Donald Sherman, chief counsel for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. “Now we’re at a place in history and on the Hill where an individual member of Congress can influence the stock price with a tweet.”

Groups like Crew are hopeful that the momentum for passing a stock-trading ban will soon translate into congressional action. Despite her initial reluctance, Pelosi has now adopted a more open-minded tone about the proposals, and the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, has said the upper chamber should address the issue.

“I think this is sort of an easy win that will have a very positive impact on policy-making and on public-facing democracy,” Sherman said.

The enactment of a stock-trading ban could have the additional benefit of boosting the public’s opinion of Congress, which has suffered in recent years. According to Gallup’s January polling, only 18% of Americans approve of how Congress is handling its job. Advocates for the proposed stock-trading ban say the policy would bolster public confidence in one of America’s most important political institutions.

“Anything that can restore Americans’ trust in Congress is a good thing,” Miller said. “This would help rebut that appearance of double-dealing and go a long way toward restoring Americans’ trust in their leadership.”

2 Florida boys accused of battery for spraying Silly String at juveniles.,https://www.1073theeagle.com/news/trending/2-florida-boys-accused-battery-spraying-silly-string-juveniles/OYHEUEIC6JFSJBL4FW3Y2XTFSE/,nottheonion,"CAPE CORAL, Fla. — Two boys are accused of battery after they allegedly sprayed two other juveniles with aerosol string, authorities said.

The boys allegedly used what is commonly called Silly String, according to the Cape Coral Police Department. The product is considered a toy and sprays plastic string as a stream from an aerosol can.

According to police, the incident occurred at about 8 p.m. EST Saturday at The Ice Cream Club in Cape Coral, the News-Press of Fort Myers reported.

The boys who allegedly shot the aerosol string were found behind a nearby business, police said. They confirmed that they had sprayed the victims with Silly String, the newspaper reported.

The boys were not arrested but were given notices to appear in court, WINK-TV reported.

The victims were not injured, but their parents said they wanted to press charges, the television station reported.

Cristina Alemar, who works at the plaza where the ice cream shop is located, said she saw the juveniles spraying the string and asked them to leave.

“Going around spraying each other is one thing but to spray other things and other people it’s not right,” Alemar told WINK. “But I think it’s a little excessive to have to appear to court.

“Even at birthday parties, there’s silly string all the time,” Alemar added. “It’s not that big of a deal, more of a hassle to clean up than anything.”

Cape Coral police spokesperson Cpt. Phil Mullen said even shooting Silly String can lead to a battery charge.

“You shoot something, anything, even something as harmless as Silly String, get it in somebody’s eye (and) cause harm, the potential is there -- so just think about what you’re doing,” Mullen told WINK.

Menstrual leave not applicable to transgender women: Taiwan Ministry of Labor,https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4438650,nottheonion,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Transgender women are not eligible for menstrual leave as they do not have uteruses and do not menstruate, the Ministry of Labor (MOL) said on Thursday (Feb. 10).

CNA reported that after a transgender woman recently applied to take a menstrual day off at her company, the company was unsure of whether she was eligible and asked the local government. The local government passed the question on to the MOL, which consulted the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW).

The MOHW responded to the MOL with an explanation from the Taiwan Association of Obstetrics and Gynecology (TAOG), that transgender women who have received gender reassignment surgery and officially registered their changed sex do not have uteruses and do not menstruate. Since the purpose of the menstrual leave is to provide relief to those who may suffer physical discomfort at work while menstruating, the policy does not apply to transgender women as they do not go through the experience.

According to the Act of Gender Equality in Employment, female employees may legally apply to take one day off for menstrual leave each month if they experience menstruation-related discomfort that prevents them from working. The employees do not need to provide any documentation to apply, and employers may not refuse, issue a penalty, or deem the day off as an absence that affects the employee’s attendance bonus or performance evaluation.

CNA cited the MOL as saying that there is no age limit to employees eligible for the menstrual leave, therefore older women may also take a day off each month as needed. Meanwhile, for women whose uterus or ovary has been removed due to health concerns, as long as the employee still ovulates and experiences discomfort due to hormonal changes, she is eligible for the menstrual leave."

When the police department in Sacramento, Calif., held a gun buyback event on Saturday, they didn't just give residents a no-questions-asked chance to turn in their unwanted firearms: They also gave out gift cards for gas.

The Sacramento Police Department said on Facebook that 134 people had dropped off firearms in exchange for $50 gas gift cards. The day's collections included at least one assault weapon, components of privately manufactured ""ghost guns"" and ""multiple other illegally configured firearms,"" they said.

While the gift cards appear to have been an incentive – especially with gas prices climbing across the country – officials said they weren't the only motivating factor.

""Among other reasons, community members most commonly cited a lack of experience or knowledge with firearms, lack of knowledge of the legality of the firearms, or an inability to safely store the firearms as the main reasons for participating in the exchange,"" they wrote.

Whatever the reason, Saturday's event – which was supposed to last for five hours – got more takers than expected. The department announced just 45 minutes into the event that it had exhausted its supply of gift cards ""due to overwhelming response"" and would be stopping an hour early.

It continued to accept firearms even after running out of gift cards, with officials praising the event as a success.

""I truly believe violent crime prevention is a shared responsibility and today's overwhelming community participation is evidence of the success we can achieve together,"" said Sacramento Police Chief Kathy Lester.

Cities across the U.S. hold gun buybacks (typically offering some sort of incentive) with the overall goal of reducing gun violence in their communities – though research suggests these programs don't quite accomplish that.

Sacramento wasn't the only city to host a fruitful buyback over the weekend. New York City officials said that people turned a total of 69 weapons in to a Brooklyn church on Saturday, at an event co-sponsored by cheesecake chain Junior's Restaurant.

People turning in rifles, shotguns and air guns got $25 bank cards, according to Forbes, while those turning in assault rifles or handguns got a $200 bank card and an iPad."

Police Officer Ticketing Cyclists in Park Hits Cyclist in Bike Lane with His SUV,https://www.bicycling.com/news/a40837493/toronto-cyclists-injured-by-police/,nottheonion,"Toronto’s High Park has become a speed trap for cyclists who look for car-free areas to ride.

Police have also been ticketing cyclists for trespassing, an off-duty officer physically assaulted a cyclist, and on-duty officer blew a stop sign and hit a cyclist.

David Shellnutt of The Biking Lawyer LLP calls on Toronto’s mayor to take action to protect cyclists and urges cyclists who are fined to fight the tickets rather than pay up.

In recent weeks, Toronto’s High Park has become a battleground as cyclists try to ride in the car-free area safely and police target and ticket them. But beyond simple speeding tickets, there’s a darker side: Police have also been ticketing cyclists for trespassing, an off-duty officer physically assaulted a cyclist, and an on-duty officer blew a stop sign and hit a cyclist.

Lawyer and cycling advocate David Shellnutt of The Biking Lawyer LLP has been vocal about these incidents, calling on Toronto’s mayor to take action and protect cyclists by hosting pop-up rides in the park and taking legal actions against the police who have been terrorizing the city’s cyclists.

Shellnutt wrote an open letter to Toronto’s mayor, John Tory, earlier this week, detailing the most recent incident. A police officer who was driving his SUV in High Park while ticketing cyclists actually hit one just outside of the park, while the rider was cycling in a bike lane. He was at a four-way stop with the officer and stopped. The officer turned right into him, failing to yield the right of way. The officer claimed that the sun was in his eyes. A supervisor came down to the scene, but it is still unclear if the officer was charged for the collision or effectively running a stop sign.

When asked about the incident, a spokesperson for the Toronto Police Department said: “We can confirm that on August 2, 2022, at approximately 6:30 p.m., a minor collision took place between a police vehicle and a cyclist at the intersection of Colborne Lodge Drive and Centre Road in the High Park area. There were no injuries reported. Traffic Services is continuing their investigation.”

While the cyclist was uninjured, his bike sustained significant damage—$2,067.90 worth of damage, according to Shellnutt. “This represents the only collision we have heard of in the park for weeks, caused by the very people alleged to be there preventing collisions and dangerous driving,” he adds.

“In no other incident would ‘the sun being in his eyes’ be an acceptable excuse for any traffic violation,” Shellnutt says. “It makes no sense that it could be an excuse in this situation.” (And from a vision perspective, sun in one’s eyes shouldn’t have made a cyclist only feet in front of a car invisible.)

One of several incidents

Shellnutt describes another worrisome incident that happened last week: “We received a call from a woman who was chased down on her bike by some man just outside of the park, who said he wanted to teach cyclists a lesson. He grabbed her bike and tossed her to the ground, essentially assault. She called the police. They showed up and let the guy go. We were curious as to why… Later, it turns out, that he’s actually an off-duty police officer. It’s wild.”

When asked about the incident, a spokesperson for the Toronto Police Department said: “We can confirm police attended the High Park Avenue and Bloor Street area on August 1 at approximately 5 p.m. for an unknown trouble call. The incident was investigated and there were no injuries reported and no charges laid.”

The week prior, a BIPOC cyclist riding in High Park reported another incident to Shellnutt, saying: “A police officer was driving his SUV in the bike lane, so I tried to get around him from the left. He gave me a warning for speeding. I asked him not to drive in the bike lane and squeeze people in. He proceeded to speed up pull up in front of me in an aggressive way and make me stop. I asked the officer if he was detaining me. He then gave me a $65-ticket for ‘engaging in prohibited activity.’”

Speeding tickets

And in the background, there are the speeding tickets we’ve written about previously: Police officers patrol the park, citing cyclists who are going even a kilometer per hour above the posted limit, while just outside of the park, cyclists are in danger even while riding in the bike lanes. Shellnutt recalls that last August, he retained three clients who had all been struck at intersections surrounding High Park while riding in the bike lanes, all suffering serious injuries as a result. “And that issue isn’t being dealt with,” he says. “Instead, cops are ticketing riders.”

A spokesperson from the Toronto Police department says that the ticketing is in response to concerns from other park users about cyclists, and says that their approach has been to “educate and caution cyclists who are speeding or committing offenses such as failing to stop at stop signs, and on some occasions, to issue Highway Traffic Act tickets, when necessary.”

“Overall, this is a small part of the traffic enforcement that occurs in the city each day,” the spokesperson noted. “The City of Toronto’s parks bylaw includes a 20 km/h speed limit and officers can use their discretion when deciding to ticket. Cyclists, like all road users, have a responsibility to obey the rules of the road to ensure the safety of pedestrians, motorists and other cyclists.”

But Shellnutt argues that the enforcement feels targeted, compared to other road users—including the officer who struck the cyclist with his SUV. “The officer issuing HTA tickets to cyclists failing to stop himself failed to stop but has not been charged, and that seems like inconsistent enforcement,” he says. “That inconsistent enforcement is at the crux of cyclists concerns: We see cars and delivery trucks parked in bike lanes across the city and in 2018 roughly 140,000 fewer speeding tickets were issued than a decade earlier; 44 per cent fewer careless driving charges; a 7,000-ticket drop in charges for making an unsafe left turn at an intersection, a 93 per cent decline.”

So, what are Shellnutt’s next steps?



Currently, he’s arming cyclists with information on how to fight speeding tickets while also rallying public support for cyclists and calling on the mayor to lay off riders. He’s also taken on the case of the rider who was struck by the police SUV pro bono, while filing a complaint against the off-duty officer who assaulted the female cyclist. And he’s urging cyclists who are fined to fight the tickets rather than quietly paying up.

Regardless of where you live, if you receive a ticket on your bike and don’t think it’s fair, Shellnutt recommends fighting it. Thanks to more virtual/remote options, you’ll likely never have to actually physically appear in court.

“Financially, it’s hard to say that fighting these tickets is worth people’s time, especially those with busy jobs and families,” he says. “But we do think it’s worth it. In Toronto, you have three options when you get one of these tickets: pay, bring it to trial, or speak to a prosecutor. We recommend that everybody opts to speak to the prosecutor. It’s depressing, but we know that in every one of our cases where cyclists are seriously injured and there are charges brought against the driver, those are most often talked down. If motorists who cause serious injury can talk tickets down, then then surely people who didn’t stop at a stop sign in a park or were going a few kilometers over the speed limit will be able to talk their tickets down as well.”

Ultimately, Shellnutt is worried about what this recent onslaught of anti-cyclist sentiment means. “Seeing this targeted enforcement blitz against cyclists strikes us and in the cycling community as a real affront,” he adds. “Every day, we report dangerous drivers parked in bike lanes, and we see scant resources dedicated to solving any of those problems, which cause real harm. We feel like it’s indicative of a mayor and a police force who are either completely out of touch with what’s happening on the on the streets of Toronto, or willfully blind to the carnage being caused out there. Because if you actually cared about safe streets, you would dedicate the resources to where, where people are actually getting injured.”

Livestock Thieves Surrender After Witchdoctor Sends Bees After Them,https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/2022/05/livestock-thieves-surrender-after-witchdoctor-sends-bees-after-them/,nottheonion,"35 SHARES Share Tweet

NAIROBI, Kenya, May 28 – There was a bizarre incident in Botsoto, Kakamega County on Friday as livestock thieves surrendered after a witchdoctor allegedly deployed bees to pursue them.

According to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI), the three suspects voluntarily returned a goat and a calf after they were attacked by a swarm of bees allegedly at the command of the witchdoctor.

The investigative agency indicated that all three suspects were reportedly mooing and bleating during the entire ordeal.

“In an incident that brought activities in Emusanda village to standstill, three men who had been attacked by a swarm of bees emerged, carrying on their shoulders the stolen goat and a calf, as they bleated and mooed onomatopoeically, like the animals,” the DCI stated.

“This after the owner of the livestock Tolibert Imbiakah, 42, visited the benevolent witch doctor, after waking up two days ago only to find the animals missing from their pen.”

It is believed that the witch doctor visited the man’s compound and conducted some rituals at the enclosure while mumbling some incantations, then left telling the owner not to worry as the thugs would come looking for him after two days.

A day later, “the three men Hillary Momanyi, 22, John Bukhazio 28 and Winston Mutiele, 20, emerged, their hands mobbed by swarms of bees as they carried the animals aloft bleating and mooing rhythmically.”

The DCI indicated that the owner of the animals emerged and positively identified his stock as the witch doctor took possession of his bees before handing over the apologetic thugs to authorities."
Proposed bill requires Americans to vote in elections or face penalty,https://www.news10.com/news/elections/propsed-bill-requires-americans-to-vote-in-elections-or-face-penalty/,nottheonion,"WASHINGTON (KVEO) — People could be fined for not voting in general elections if a bill recently introduced into Congress becomes law. The Civic Duty to Vote Act was introduced to the House of Representatives on Monday.

Written by former chairman of the Task Force on Election Reform, Rep. John Larson (CT-1), the bill aims to require each eligible citizen to appear to vote in each regularly scheduled general election for federal office. To be an eligible citizen, a person has to be registered to vote for an upcoming election.

If any eligible citizen is found to have not voted in the general election, a $20 civil money penalty will be assessed to these individuals. However, the bill’s text allows Americans to get around the penalty if they are not registered to vote, are unable to vote because of an emergency, cannot follow the terms of the act because of religious beliefs, or if they are unaware of their eligibility to vote.

A waiver would also be available for citizens to apply if they cannot afford the $20 penalty or if they commit to performing one hour of community service. If a person fails to pay the $20 penalty, they would face no additional penalty or any denial of government benefits, according to the bill’s text. Law enforcement agencies could not use a violation of the Civic Duty to Vote Act to conduct any further criminal investigation on them.

Now that the bill has been introduced into the House, it will have to pass a vote there. If that succeeds, it will have to pass a vote in the Senate before being signed into law by the president. Larson is. To read the bill’s full text, click Read the bill’s full text at Congress’ website."
"Cycle lane will be ""clear getaway"" for shoplifters and drug dealers, business owners claim",https://road.cc/content/news/fears-new-cycle-lane-will-be-clear-getaway-criminals-291803,nottheonion,"Middlesbrough business owners have spoken out against plans to build a segregated cycle lane outside their shops, claiming it will be a ""clear getaway"" for drug dealers and shoplifters, as well as stopping customers park their cars.

Plans for a new two-way cycle lane and reduced 20mph speed limits along Linthorpe Road, expected to cost between £1.3m and £2.4m, were approved by the council this week to the dismay of some shop owners.

It will be the second phase of the scheme, with works on a cycle lane between Borough Road and Ayresome Street already underway. Now, the works will be continued between Ayresome Street and Devonshire/Cumberland Road, in a project funded by Tees Valley Combined Authority.

Middlesbrough Mayor Andy Preston urged shopkeepers to consider the ways the infrastructure ""could change the environment and way we operate and create a more pleasant experience"" for everyone.

However, speaking to regional news outlet TeessideLive, plenty of business owners and workers came forward to criticise the now-approved proposals.

One worker from The Sleep Centre, a bed and mattress shop, said the cycle lane would be a nightmare for their business, and even went as far to say it would give a ""clear getaway"" to criminals.

""You see drug peddlers along here all of the time. They [council] are just giving people a getaway. All of the shoplifters that go into Iceland and Tesco and park their bikes outside for a second, run in, take whatever it is, and then they disappear.

""So what’s going to happen here is a clear getaway because there will be bollards so no-one can stop them and the police will have a field day trying to catch them.""

Another person questioned by the website, but who did not want to be named, expressed concern about the lane being used by drug dealers.

The Sleep Centre employee also raised the most popular criticism of the segregated lanes — they will stop customers parking outside the shops. To accommodate the phase one lanes, 50 parking spaces will be lost, with the council suggesting the 86 spaces in a nearby pay and display car park on Amber Street would be enough to fill demand.

Phase two will see 19 of 42 parking spaces removed, although five disabled bays will remain, just in a new location.

""We could do with more parking spaces but the council is removing them,"" The Sleep Centre worker continued. ""It’s creating a big impact because people are avoiding the area so it’s affecting business already. Turnover has decreased and the number of people walking by has decreased. It’s a very busy road, buses are struggling to get through. People are double parking just to take goods inside to shops…and they have no choice.""

Lisa Ellis, owner of florist Daisys and Edwinas, said cyclists are a ""nuisance"" who are ""always in the way"".

""It’s older people who it will probably affect most who need to park outside. It might make it awkward for them,"" she said. ""People are just a nuisance on bikes, they’re always in the way.""

Another local shop worker added: ""Our customers will have to park further away and if they park on the streets behind here they won’t have a car when they come back.""

In reply to parking concerns about the phase two lanes, the council advised another nearby car park with 102 spaces is currently underused and could meet demand.

Mayor Preston told the council's executive meeting ""nobody will be unable to park.""

""I personally get some emails on this matter of cycle lanes, certainly, they are not popular with shopkeepers for a few reasons. The way I think of it is that it might make it a little bit more difficult for some of their customers to park sometimes, I do think it could change the environment and the way we operate and create a more pleasant experience for those who shop and it might get more people out over time.

""Keeping existing cyclists safe is obviously critical and important, encouraging new cyclists is great too, for their mental health and physical health. There will always be resistance, partly because it’s change and people don’t like change and partly because it will make parking for some people a little bit more difficult sometimes but nobody will be unable to park.""

Shopkeepers do not appear convinced, however, with the co-owner of The Art House saying he does not see many cyclists on the route and ""to lose any more spaces would not be good for business.""

Despite this he did express support for building cycle lanes, just not when it impacts his customers' parking: ""I think there should be cycle lanes, it doesn’t really concern me, it’s just a parking issue for customers. I don’t oppose it.""

A store manager at Abdul's Cash and Carry added: ""We are going to find it very very difficult to get the trucks in and unload the trucks. It’s a struggle as it is.

""We were the first cash and carry and we have been there for a lot of years and now there are several cash and carry there, all selling the same products, we are all fighting against each other just to get trade. Now we have got these bicycle lanes coming down.""

Mr Halif said the changes would cause ""chaos"".

Work on phase one of the project began at the end of February and is expected to be complete by early summer.

In response to a public consultation, over 80 per cent of respondents said they travel to the area by car, taxi or motorbike, with a little over 10 per cent saying they cycle.

More than 70 per cent said they did not support the proposals, with a similar figure saying it would be bad for business, and 40 per cent saying the segregated lane was unnecessary."
Judge shames 72 year old cancer patient for overgrown yard,https://www.nbc12.com/2022/01/17/judge-shames-72-year-old-cancer-patient-overgrown-yard/?fbclid=IwAR0OGbN54395G-wTcdJqPp2z_Z1PCwn15ndFKl3ViqlI_at8LS9weTNMvRQ,nottheonion,"HAMTRAMCK, Mich. (WDIV) - A Michigan judge is being criticized after she berated a 72-year-old cancer patient for not cleaning up his lawn.

The exchange between Judge Alexis Krot and 72-year-old defendant Burhan Chowdhury took place during a virtual court hearing related to failure to keep his property maintained in violation of a Hamtramck, Michigan, ordinance.

“The neighbors should not have to look at that,” Krot told the defendant. “You should be ashamed of yourself.”

The man’s son, Shibbir Chowdhury, appeared at the hearing alongside his father, who doesn’t speak much English. He explained that his father is a cancer patient who is undergoing chemotherapy, and that leaves him too weak to go out and clear overgrown plants.

During the hearing, the 72-year-old could be heard struggling to breathe when he tried to speak. But his illness didn’t appear to garner much sympathy from Krot.

“If I could give you jail time on this, I would,” she told the defendant.

The 72-year-old man was diagnosed with cancer in the lymph nodes in 2019, and treatments have taken a toll on his mobility, according to his son. (Source: Family photos, WDIV via CNN)

Shibbir Chowdhury calls the judge’s comment “very rude.”

“Telling a cancer patient that he should go to jail,” he said. “It felt very bad to me because in this town, nobody wants to hear about their father going to jail.”

Shibbir Chowdhury admits the family violated the city ordinance. He says his dad was diagnosed with cancer in the lymph nodes in 2019, and treatments have taken a toll on his mobility. Since the diagnosis, the son and his mom have been trying to maintain the property.

“I usually take care of those stuff, the backyard and everything, but at that time, I was out of the country,” Shibbir Chowdhury said. “That was really a mistake. I should’ve taken care of that.”

The family says the property has already been cleaned up, and they plan to pay the $100 fine for violating the ordinance.

“It’s still like she should have told my father more politely,” Shibbir Chowdhury said. “We didn’t really expect this kind of behavior from a respectable person like a judge.”

"Influencer Pilot Crashed His Plane on Purpose, the FAA Says",https://www.insider.com/influencer-pilot-trevor-jacob-crashed-plane-on-purpose-faa-2022-4,nottheonion,"The FAA revoked the private pilot certificate of a YouTuber after he was found to have crashed a plane on purpose.

Trevor Jacob, 28, was accused online of faking a plane crash last year to get views and likes.

After the crash, he had ""recovered and then disposed of the wreckage,"" the FAA said.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has revoked the private pilot certificate of a YouTube influencer pilot after determining that he crashed his plane on purpose for a video.

""You demonstrated a lack of care, judgment and responsibility by choosing to jump out of an aircraft solely so you could record the footage of the crash,"" the agency told YouTuber Trevor Jacob on April 11, in a letter seen by Insider.

""Your egregious and intentional actions on these dates indicate that you presently lack the degree of care, judgment and responsibility required of a certificate holder.""

Jacob, who has around 133,000 YouTube subscribers, had been under investigation after he was accused of staging a plane crash so that he could make a video about it for views.

In the video ""I Crashed My Plane"" posted last December, the 28-year-old can be seen parachuting out of a civilian aircraft — which he said experienced engine failure — while flying over the Los Padres National Forest in California. The video was immediately met with skepticism from aviation enthusiasts, who questioned if the crash was a real accident.

The FAA agreed that it seemed odd that Jacob was wearing a parachute in the first place.

In its letter to Jacob, the FAA added: ""During this flight, you opened the left side pilot door before you claimed the engine had failed.""

Jacob also made no attempt to contact air traffic control on the emergency frequency, did not attempt restarting the engine, and did not look for a place to land, ""even though there were multiple areas within gliding range in which you could have made a safe landing,"" the agency said.

Following the crash, he ""recovered and then disposed of the wreckage,"" the FAA continued.

On Wednesday, Jacob did not appear to be aware of the FAA's ruling, telling the New York Times in an email: ""Where'd you get that information?""

He did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment."
FedEx wants to install anti-missile lasers in its cargo jets,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/travel/fedex-asks-us-permission-install-anti-missile-lasers-cargo-jets-rcna12298,nottheonion,"Delivery giant FedEx is asking federal regulators for permission to install countermeasures in its cargo jets designed to thwart missile attacks, according to a notice published in the Federal Register.

“In recent years, in several incidents abroad, civilian aircraft were fired upon by man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS),” FedEx says in the public notice. “This has led several companies to design and adapt systems like a laser-based missile-defense system for installation on civilian aircraft, to protect those aircraft against heat-seeking missiles.”

FedEx adds that it wants to install a missile-defense system that “directs infrared laser energy toward an incoming missile, in an effort to interrupt the missile’s tracking of the aircraft’s heat.”

The company notes that infrared laser energy can pose a hazard to people on the aircraft, on the ground, or on other aircraft, and it proposes a series of steps to mitigate that danger. The system would have to be approved by the Federal Aviation Administration.

FedEx says it wants to install the system in the Airbus A321-200 airplane, a model it does not yet fly as part of its fleet of more than 650 aircraft. The company did not respond to NBC News requests for comment.

Anti-missile systems have been installed in U.S. commercial aircraft as far back as 2008. The Israeli passenger carrier El Al introduced a missile defense system in 2004.

Hundreds of people were killed in two high-profile missile attacks on aircraft in recent years — attacks that appear to have stemmed from misidentifications.

Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 from Tehran to Kyiv was shot down shortly after takeoff by the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which later said it mistook the plane for a cruise missile.

A Malaysia Airlines passenger flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was shot down in 2014 while flying over eastern Ukraine, in what international inquiries concluded was a botched operation by Russian-backed separatists.

In 2003, a DHL cargo jet was hit by a missile after taking off in Baghdad, but the three person crew was able to land the plane safely."
Herschel Walker asks 'Why are there still apes?' in discussion about evolution,https://thehill.com/media/598393-herschel-walker-asks-why-are-there-still-apes-in-discussion-about-evolution,nottheonion,"The Republican front-runner for a Senate seat in Georgia, Herschel Walker, last weekend expressed doubt about evolution, citing the existence of apes as his reasoning for doubting the scientific theory.

“At one time, science said man came from apes. Did it not?” Walker said while speaking to the lead pastor of Sugar Hill Church in Sugar Hill, Ga.

“Every time I read or hear that, I think to myself, ‘You just didn’t read the same Bible I did,’ ” responded the church’s lead pastor, Chuck Allen.

“If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Walker said, posing the question to Allen and the crowd.

“Now you’re getting too smart for us,” Allen replied.

“Think about this: We have an evolution that is — we’ve gotten so intelligent that if that is still true, why are there still apes?” Walker added.

HuffPost was the first to report on Walker’s comments.

According to a PBS FAQ about evolution, “Humans are more closely related to modern apes … but we didn’t evolve from apes, either. Humans share a common ancestor with modern African apes. … Scientists believe this common ancestor existed 5 to 8 million years ago. Shortly thereafter, the species diverged into two separate lineages. One of these lineages ultimately evolved into gorillas and chimps, and the other evolved into early human ancestors called hominids.”

Walker, 60, is a former star NFL running back who has been endorsed by former President Trump in his bid to unseat Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) in the November midterm elections.

He has faced some controversy in his campaign.

Walker’s ex-wife, Cindy Grossman, claimed in her divorce filings that Walker was physically abusive toward her and had even threatened to kill her, which prompted Grossman to seek a protective order, reports The Washington Post. Grossman also said in 2008 that Walker had put a gun to her head as he threatened to murder her.

In December, Walker said he has been “accountable” for his actions against Grossman, but did not elaborate.

Walker’s ex-girlfriend also said in 2012 that when she attempted to end her relationship with him, he threatened to “blow her head off” and kill himself, while another woman alleged that Walker threatened and stalked her in 2002, though no charges have been filed on those accusations, the Post notes, and Walker denies them."
"Uvalde police, school district no longer cooperating with Texas probe of shooting",https://abcnews.go.com/US/uvalde-police-school-district-longer-cooperating-texas-probe/story?id=85093405,nottheonion,"The Uvalde Police Department and the Uvalde Independent School District police force are no longer cooperating with the Texas Department of Public Safety's investigation into the massacre at Robb Elementary School and the state's review of the law enforcement response, multiple law enforcement sources tell ABC News.

The Uvalde police chief and a spokesperson for the Uvalde Independent School District did not immediately respond to requests for comment from ABC News.

According to sources, the decision to stop cooperating occurred soon after the director of DPS, Col. Steven McCraw, held a news conference Friday during which he said the delayed police entry into the classroom was ""the wrong decision"" and contrary to protocol.

Reached by ABC News, a spokesperson for the Texas Department of Public Safety said, ""The Uvalde Police Department and Uvalde CISD Police have been cooperating with investigators.

"Texas education officials proposed changing ""slavery"" to ""involuntary relocation"" when teaching second graders",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-education-officials-proposed-changing-slavery-to-involuntary-relocation-for-second-grade-standards/,nottheonion,"Texas education officials are considering a change in the way slavery is taught to second graders – replacing the word ""slavery"" with ""involuntary relocation"" in state standards.

The Texas Education Agency, which is responsible for setting curriculums and state-wide student assessment testing, has multiple ""work groups"" that draft curriculums for each subject and grade.

When the agency presented the idea to use ""involuntary relocation"" at a recent State Board of Education meeting, board member Aicha Davis said she was ""not OK with that at all."" Davis shared a clip from the meeting on Facebook.

There is a viral post stating the Texas Education Agency is trying to change the word “Slavery” to “Involuntary Relocation"" in Texas history standards. Sadly, there is some truth to that statement. The SBOE was given the working document from social studies Work Group D, which reviewed elementary and middle school TEKS, during our last meeting. The group suggested introducing the journey of Africans to America in 2nd grade using the phrase ""involuntary relocation."" I was not ok with that at all and addressed it with TEA staff. The Work Groups have been directed to have further discussions on appropriate language and terminology, and the SBOE will begin readings in the Fall. Posted by Aicha Davis on Thursday, June 30, 2022

""There is a viral post stating the Texas Education Agency is trying to change the word 'Slavery' to 'Involuntary Relocation' in Texas history standards,"" she wrote in the caption of the video. ""Sadly, there is some truth to that statement.""

During the meeting, Davis asked about the proposed change. ""I don't know if that's a fair representation of what we should be saying about that journey,"" Davis said during the meeting.

A member of the agency told Davis that the work group that came up with this language discussed ""what would make sense to second graders"" while also recognizing there are ideas that need to be addressed throughout kindergarten to eighth grade.

""They were looking at some trade books that exist and kind of talking about how you would explain to second graders that a lot of people got to this country in very different ways and for very different reasons – some of which were voluntary and some were not. I think the very best way to address that was what they were struggling with,"" the agency member said.

Davis said the work groups have been directed to have further discussions on appropriate language and terminology.

In an email to CBS News, board member Pat Hardy said what was presented at the meeting was ""an initial draft of 2nd Grade Social Studies standards from a review committee that included a section titled: 'Enslaved Peoples in America'.""

""While the proposed standards clearly described enslaved peoples in colonial times, the draft description 'involuntary relocation' for African peoples who were sold into slavery did not paint a clear or full picture,"" Hardy said. ""As a result, the SBOE voted unanimously to send the language back to be reworked. This board is committed to the truth, which includes accurate descriptions of historical events.""

""Our state's curriculum will not downplay the role of slavery in American history.""

Still, the proposal went viral, and many condemned it. Iro Omere, a Democratic candidate for Congress for Texas' 4th district, called the proposal ""disgraceful.""

""It is disgraceful that the Texas Education Agency would go this far to change how we teach children about the history of our country,"" Omere said in a statement to CBS News. ""Children are being taught that the Civil War started because of a 'conflict of states' rights.' Now to hear the term 'slavery' will be changed to 'involuntary relocation' is an insult to generations of people forced into slavery and the descendants that have suffered the impact of racism.""

""We have come to the point now that we must hold the Texas Education Agency and the State Board of Education accountable for the deliberate miseducation of Texan children,"" Omere said.

The controversial proposal comes after many Republican-led states, like Texas, passed or considered laws that would ban ""divisive topics"" being discussed in schools. Some states aimed to ban critical race theory. The theory, which is usually taught at the college level, acknowledges racial disparities that have persisted in U.S. history and offers a framework to understand how racism is reinforced in U.S. law and culture. There is no evidence critical race theory is taught in K-12 schools.

Under Texas' new law banning critical race theory in the classroom, teachers cannot discuss the idea that ""one race or sex is inherently superior to another race or sex."" After passing the law, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has asked schools to review materials available to students that they might deem ""inappropriate.""

The State Board of Education Chair Kevin Ellis reassured Abbott in a recent letter that the board is reviewing textbooks and that the legislature granted the board ""the authority to reject instructional materials that are not 'suitable for grade level.'""

The board has until the end of the year to finish their review of the social studies curriculum, Davis said."

Wales introduces ban on smacking and slapping children: Welsh government hails ‘historic moment’ for children’s rights amid calls for England to follow suit.,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/21/wales-introduces-ban-on-smacking-and-slapping-children,nottheonion,"Smacking and slapping children has been outlawed in Wales, with people told to contact social services or police if they see a parent or carer meting out physical punishment.

The law change, which came into force first thing on Monday, was hailed as “historic” by the Labour-led Welsh government and a number of child protection champions, who called for England to follow suit.

But critics, including the Welsh Conservatives, expressed concerns that it would criminalise parents trying to do their best and create a “Stasi culture” with people “shopping” their neighbours and even making malicious allegations.

The legislation that has come into force removes the defence of “reasonable punishment” that has been in force since Victorian times in England and Wales and makes all forms of physical punishment against children, such as smacking, hitting, slapping and shaking illegal. The law will apply to everybody in Wales, including visitors.

Julie Morgan, the deputy minister for social services, who has campaigned for the law change for more than two decades, said: “Today is a historic moment for children and their rights in Wales as we make physically punishing children a thing of the past.”

Morgan rejected the notion the law would create a “Stasi culture”. She said: “We don’t want people spying,” but added: “Looking after children is the responsibility of the whole community.”

Morgan said attitudes had changed in recent years with few parents now using physical punishment. “The culture has started to change and I think this law will reinforce that,” she added.

She said she hoped England would follow the example of Wales and Scotland, which brought in a ban in November 2020. She said: “We’d love it to happen in England. We’re happy to work with people in England to push this forward.”

Viv Laing, the policy and public affairs manager at NSPCC Cymru Wales, said both England and Northern Ireland, where there has been no law change, were outliers.

She said: “In Wales, as in more than 60 countries around the world, we will no longer tolerate physical violence against children. Until now, children were the only group in our society who it was acceptable to strike in certain circumstances. We don’t allow the physical punishment of adults or animals, so it is absurd that we have for so long with children.”

The Welsh government’s website makes it clear that anyone who physically punishes a child will be breaking the law, risks being arrested or charged with assault and may get a criminal record.

In a Q&A section, the question “What should I do if I see a child being physically punished or if I am concerned about a child?” is posed. The answer is: “Contact your local social services department … You can also call the police in an emergency or if a child is in immediate danger.”

The government says the police and Crown Prosecution Service will apply two tests: is there evidence to charge and is it in the public interest to do so. They will also consider what is in the best interests of the child. It stresses that “rough and tumble” play is permitted.

The Welsh Conservative and shadow social services minister, Gareth Davies, said the law was “unnecessary, unworkable, and undesired” and had been pushed through by politicians who thought they knew better than parents.

He said: “I am very worried about campaigns that encourage a Stasi culture in Wales where people – and children – are encouraged to shop parents who discipline their children in what they deem a proportionate manner into the police.

“The Labour government in Cardiff Bay is clearly more interested in new age dogma rather than respecting parents.”

HSBC AM global head of responsible investing: 'Who cares if Miami is six metres under water in 100 years?',https://www.investmentweek.co.uk/news/4050010/hsbc-global-head-responsible-investing-cares-miami-metres-water-100,nottheonion,"Speaking at a Financial Times Moral Money event yesterday (19 May), Kirk compared the climate crisis to the Y2K bug, bemoaning that throughout his financial career there has always been ""some nutjob telling me about the end of the world"".

""What bothers me about this one is the amount of work these people make me do,"" he said.

Stock Spotlight: One of the world's 'most polished PR machines' HSBC doubles profits in Q3

Presenting a speech entitled Why investors need not worry about climate risk, Kirk asked: ""Who cares if Miami is six metres under water in 100 years?

""Amsterdam has been six metres underwater for ages and that is a really nice place. We will cope with it.""

He went on to add that he does not ""doubt the science at all"" and acknowledged ""there will be fires"" but argued this should be solved through adaption.

""One of the tragedies of this whole debate, which we obsess about at HSBC, is that we spend way too much on mitigation and financing and not enough on adaption financing.""

Kirk also questioned the motive behind those who have raised the alarm on the climate crisis within the financial industry, including ex-governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney, who he quoted on a slide entitled Unsubstantiated, shrill, partisan, self-serving, apocalyptic warnings are ALWAYS wrong.

Carney's quote read: ""Climate change will dwarf cost of living pain.""

Kirk said: ""I completely get that at the end of your central bank career there are still many, many years to fill in. You have to say something, you have to fly around the world to conferences, you have to out-hyperbole the next guy, but I feel like it is getting a little bit out of hand.""

He raised further issue with central banks themselves, suggesting their climate-related financial models are skewed to get the result they are after.

""What they have done is [factor] a gigantic interest rate shock on all the Bank of England and central bank scenarios to get a nasty number,"" Kirk said.

""Even with a carbon tax, even hitting growth, they could not make climate risk move the needle, so they had to get their clever wonks in the backroom to put a gigantic interest rate shock through their models in order to make headlines.""

HSBC set to be accused of greenwashing by Advertising Standards Authority - reports

Kirk also questioned the importance of the impact of climate change for HSBC, suggesting the possible devastating effects are irrelevant to the running of its business.

""At a big bank like ours, what do people think the average loan length is?"" he asked. ""It is six years. What happens to the planet in year seven is actually irrelevant to our loan book. For coal, what happens in year seven is actually irrelevant.""

He concluded: ""Let's get back to making money out of the transition.""

After the speech was shown to HSBC Asset Management yesterday, HSBC AM's CEO Nicolas Moreau told Investment Week the remarks made by Kirk ""do not reflect the views of HSBC Asset Management nor HSBC Group in any way"".

""HSBC Asset Management is committed to driving the transition to a sustainable global economy and has a fiduciary responsibility to ensure its clients' monies are managed for positive long-term environmental and social outcomes,"" they said.

""HSBC regards climate change as one of the most serious emergencies facing the planet, and is committed to supporting its customers in their transition to net zero and a sustainable future and, like HSBC Asset Management, is committed to achieving net zero by 2050."""
Protesters don tinfoil hats as radiation blamed for sickness,https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/politics/protesters-turn-to-tinfoil-hats-as-increasing-sickness-blamed-on-government-beaming-radiation-rays/FDCP6NEFJUQWWINL2GXI7OKS6E/,nottheonion,"Those protesting at Parliament are increasingly reporting symptoms of illness and linking it to a conspiracy theory that the Government is making them sick with a radiation weapon. Video / Twitter / Telegram

Those protesting at Parliament are increasingly reporting symptoms of illness and linking it to a conspiracy theory that the Government is making them sick with a radiation weapon.

The theory has gained so much traction in the protest crowd that one of the leading organisers, Leighton Baker, posted a social media video trying to debunk it even as some believers began wearing tinfoil hats for protection.

Baker told the Herald he posted the video to assure people they were not suffering ill-effects as a result of a radiation weapon.

Instead, he said it was the consequence of people camping around Parliament and ""just the constant bombardment surrounded by cell phones, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth"" at a higher rate than that to which they were accustomed.

Baker, who was New Conservatives leader from 2017 to 2020, said he believed the symptoms people were reporting would not be Covid-19 symptoms, although accepted the disease and the virus that carried it might be present among protesters.

""I haven't seen a lot of people walking around sick. There could be but it's not like I'm seeing a lot of disease walking around.""

And if there was, Baker said the campaign for ""freedom"" included people's right to circulate in public when they had contracted Covid-19 and were contagious.

""If you think you have Covid you should stay home. If you want to go out, that's your choice. They still get to choose. We want people to be able to choose rather than say we're going to lock you up if you don't [comply]. I believe in free choice.""

Baker said he believed the latest variant was nothing worse than a mild flu and disputed the veracity of data showing five people had died in the current outbreak.

There is currently a photograph of a number of people at the protest in Wellington wearing tinfoil hats. While in keeping with the commentary from some protesters, it is unknown whether those in the tinfoil hats are serious or performing a parody of sorts.

Baker said he had not seen people wearing tinfoil hats and believed all that was required to deal with people's reported symptoms was to drink water and to remove shoes to reconnect through feet to the earth.

Regional medical officer of health Dr Craig Thornley said there were ""several positive cases of Covid-19"" linked to the protest, which had been listed as a location of interest.

""As protesters come to Wellington from across New Zealand, a cluster identification process has been established within the National Contact Tracing System so that we can look to monitor the number of positive cases linked to the protest.""

Thornley said it was expected to be difficult to build an accurate data picture of positive cases linked to the protest site ""as we anticipate reluctance from some protesters [towards] being tested"".

He said health officials continued to search for ways to improve testing in ""high-risk communities"" to try to gather information that would reduce the impact of Covid-19 on the health system.

In the past few days, coughing and wheezing has become a common feature on livestreams from the protest site. It has also seen those protesting turn to social media to ask for somewhere to stay after becoming ill.

One woman asked: ""I have a fever and a sore throat and would so appreciate a bed for the night."" In response, another woman said: ""Many are suffering from EMF effects down there and many who came home too but they don't have sore throat or cough, just vomiting, severe body pains and headaches.""

All the listed effects are among the symptoms of the Covid-19 Omicron variant.

One protester in a Telegram channel has posted a video in which an ""expert"" uses a device to apparently measure electromagnetic fields coming from the concrete blocks police have used to contain the device.

""There is something in this block that is emitting electromagnetic radiation.""

There is also a letter circulating which is addressed to St Paul's Cathedral, which neighbours Parliament, accusing it of secretly harbouring ""surveillance and other technology"" and demanding it be removed.

A video circulating on social media shows a woman from the protest saying people were developing headaches and had starting using earplugs and foil-lined fire blankets to keep themselves well.

The woman then says: ""This is so funny. People are actually making tinfoil hats. Isn't that funny? But they work apparently.""

Baker's efforts to debunk the radiation rumour saw him post a video on his Facebook page introducing an expert in radio waves who was ""not a nutter"".

The expert then talked about testing he had done in the area, saying, ""I've not found any anomalies after measuring this site a number of times.""

Baker's expert then went on to say people were experiencing the symptoms of microwave sickness ""but in a very condensed period of time"". Baker's expert then said the clustering of people camping together meant they were exposed to higher levels of microwave radiation.

Baker said: ""I'm fully aware a lot of people are feeling a bit stressed about it, anxious and feeling a bit funny.""

The expert, who was called Andy, said people should drink water - ""our blood is 93 per cent water"" - to create a Faraday cage-style barrier to radiation.

""Another good thing to do is just ground yourself in bare feet ... so your body can get back in tune.""

Baker also suggested those feeling ill should go to the beach and have a swim.

Public health officials in Wellington had set up a ""cluster identification"" system to track positive Covid-19 cases from the protest.

A community testing centre is operating at 196-200 Taranaki St, which was open from 10am to 4pm, seven days a week, for people with symptoms or those who were household contacts.

If people needed advice on symptoms or how to seek care they should call Healthline on 0800 358 5453."

(Patrick Doyle/Reuters)

Mike Lindell, founder and CEO of MyPillow, is donating thousands of pillows to Canadian truckers protesting COVID-19 mandates and restrictions in Ottawa—as he praised the movement dubbed “Freedom Convoy” for all the work they have done.

“In Canada, they have backed off on some of the mandates,” Lindell said. “The truckers are gaining. It is working … they’re doing it now on the U.S. side. MyPillow’s getting involved. We’re shipping up pillows to all of the truckers.”

“I don’t know if they’ll let us into Canada, but we’re gonna try and get pillows to all of them,” he added. “Our voices are getting out there, and things are getting done to get this—to fight the evil. I mean, it’s just unreal.”

Lindell, an outspoken political activist, has become known for talking about election fraud claims. The American businessman also debuted a documentary that allegedly shows the November 2020 election involved high levels of fraud.

He has faced personal repercussions for his remarks about the election and Twitter also suspended him, citing alleged violations of the company’s civic integrity policy, before permanently banning the account. YouTube and Vimeo, meanwhile, took down his documentary, “Absolute Proof.”

The CEO’s latest donation is not the first time he assisted people in need with his product. Most recently, he sent more than 10,000 pillows to victims of the Kentucky tornado. In 2017, his team also shipped six trucks loaded with about 60,000 pillows to Houston in support of those affected by Hurricane Harvey.

Lindell was quoted at the time: “For them, it’s a blessing to be able to … sleep well, or get help to sleep,” he said, adding that “a lot of them don’t have beds, they have to sleep in cars, shelters, etc.”

The “Freedom Convoy” started in late January as a demonstration by truckers against the federal government’s requirement for cross-border truck drivers to get vaccinated against the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) virus. The demonstration has since evolved into a large movement joined by people from across Canada to oppose different COVID-19 mandates and restrictions.

Vehicle convoys came to Ottawa on Jan. 29, and many have stayed in the city, with trucks and other vehicles parked by Parliament Hill. Since then, various protest convoys have been set up in different parts of Canada. Protesters in Ottawa say they won’t leave until the government lifts COVID-19 mandates.

Kentucky Noah's Ark sues insurance company over damage caused by heavy rains,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kentucky-noahs-ark-encounter-sues-insurance-company-over-heavy-rain-damage/,nottheonion,"Williamstown, Ky. — In the Bible, the ark survived an epic flood. Yet the owners of Kentucky's Noah's ark attraction are demanding their insurance company bail them out after heavy rains caused nearly $1 million in property damage.



The Ark Encounter says in a federal lawsuit that rains in 2017 and 2018 caused a landslide on its access road. The lawsuit says the road has been rebuilt. The ark was not damaged.

The Courier Journal reports the attraction's insurance carriers refused to cover the damage, however.

The 510-foot-long wooden ark has been a popular northern Kentucky attraction since its 2016 opening. Answers in Genesis, the company that operates the Ark Encounter, also operates the Creation Museum in Petersburg, which opened its doors in 2007.

The suit names Allied World Assurance Co. Holdings of Switzerland, its use company and three other insurance carriers.



Ark Encounter seeks compensatory and punitive damages. The Swiss company hasn't responded in court filings."
Entire North Carolina police department resigns after new Black town manager is hired,https://www.foxnews.com/us/entire-north-carolina-police-department-resigns-new-town-manager-hired,nottheonion,"An entire police department in North Carolina resigned Friday after the hiring of a new town manager.

Police officers and other officials in the small town of Kenly have submitted mass-resignation letters citing stress, a hostile work environment and an inability to continue the department's long-term betterment projects.

In a letter to Town Manager Justine Jones, Police Chief Josh Gibson expressed regret toward the negative changes he felt were occurring in the department.

""In my 21 years at the Kenly Police Department, we have seen ups and downs. But, especially in the last 3 years, we have made substantial progress that we had hoped to continue. However, due to the hostile work environment now present in the Town of Kenly, I do not believe progress is possible,"" Gibson wrote.

Neither the police department nor Jones has been willing to speak to the media on the nature of these complaints, local outlets report.

Gibson's letter was only one of several resignations that were made publicly available after the mass exodus.

""It is with a heavy heart that I take this action. I have been with the town since 2004 and fully expected to finish my law enforcement career with the Town of Kenly. Unfortunately, there are decisions being made that jeopardize my safety and make me question what the future will hold for a Kenly Police Officer,"" wrote officer G.W. Strong.

While all others addressed their resignations to Gibson, the police chief himself submitted his to Jones.

Jones was just hired as town manager last month after serving in various local government positions in other states. Her new position was celebrated by the Town of Kenly in a June press release.

""Jones has dedicated her career to public service over the last 16 years during which she worked in progressively responsible positions with local governments in Minnesota, Virginia, South Carolina and North Carolina,"" the town wrote in the statement. ""She began her municipal career as the Executive Assistant to the City Manager and National Urban Fellow in the City of Norfolk, Virginia""

Police leadership and active duty officers were joined in their resignation by other officials.

""I have truly enjoyed working for The Town the last four years. Due to the current situations and the stress in the work area lately, my main concern is my health, and right now I need to focus on my wellbeing. The work area is very hostile and I will not let myself be around that kind of atmosphere,"" wrote Christy Thomas, utility clerk for the town of Kenly.

Some outgoing government employees kept their messages curt and to the point — including Town Clerk Sharon Evans.

""I will be retiring sooner than I had planned. This is my two weeks notice as of today. I can no longer work under the stress,"" wrote Evans."
The CIA honors Harriet Tubman as a model spy with a new statue,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/cia-honors-underground-railroad-hero-harriet-tubman-model-spy-new-stat-rcna50159?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_blk,nottheonion,"When CIA employees walk into their headquarters in suburban Virginia, they are now greeted by a young Black woman. She’s holding a lantern and armed with a pistol in her belt, looking fearless.

The woman is Harriet Tubman, a hero of the Underground Railroad, portrayed in a striking bronze statue recently unveiled at the Central Intelligence Agency in Langley.

The idea for the statue came from CIA officers who studied Tubman in a leadership class, including her time spying for the Union Army during the Civil War.

Seeing her as a skilled covert operator, the officers urged the agency to add a statue of Tubman to the sculptures already on the agency’s campus, officials said.

“What she did was an example of intelligence work, going behind enemy lines, using safe houses and signals intelligence to get people to freedom,” said Robert Beyer, director of the CIA’s museum.

Tubman operated with ingenuity, stealth, courage and selflessness, Beyer said. “These are all traits we want our officers to embody.”

Installing a statue in Tubman’s honor also reinforces the CIA’s goal of building diversity among its workforce, Beyer and other officials said.

“One of the things that this agency has in place is the idea that our workforce cannot work on worldwide missions without looking like the United States, without looking like the world,” said Janelle Neises, deputy director of the CIA’s museum.

The CIA, for decades an agency dominated by white males with Ivy League degrees, and other U.S. intelligence agencies have struggled to recruit a diverse workforce, especially among the more senior ranks.

A recent report by the Office of Director of National Intelligence found the percentage of minorities in the intelligence community’s civilian workforce increased slightly to 27% from 26.5% in fiscal year 2019, with 12.3% identifying as African American. But Black and minority representation significantly drops off through senior ranks of the intelligence services, the report said. Minority representation in the intelligence agencies also lags behind the federal government as a whole, where minorities make up about 36 percent of the workforce.

A CIA-commissioned report in 2015 found the agency had consistently failed to promote minorities to leadership positions and that advances in diversity at the top level of the CIA had stalled over a 10-year period.

But a CIA spokesperson said the agency had made “significant gains” in promoting diversity over the past two years, with the percentage of minorities rising to 30 percent among newly hired officers for fiscal year 2022, compared to 27 percent in the previous year.

Last year, the promotion list for the senior intelligence service, equivalent to the top ranks of the military, showed the most diversity in the CIA’s history, with minorities accounting for 27 percent of the positions, the spokesperson said.

The agency held a ceremony to unveil the new Tubman statute in September, and her great-great-great grandniece, Michele Jones Galvin, attended. The statue is part of a series of events marking the CIA’s 75th anniversary, including a newly refurbished museum open to agency employees.

“For all of us, this statue will not only remind us of Tubman’s story. It will inspire us to live by her values,” CIA Director William Burns said in a statement to NBC News.

There are three other sculptures at the CIA offices that have been on display for years, all of them of white men.

A bronze statue of Nathan Hale, the Revolutionary War spy who was caught and executed by the British, stands across from Tubman. Inside the building’s entrance, there is a statue of William “Wild Bill” Donovan, the chief of the World War II spy service that preceded the CIA, the Office of Strategic Services. Looking out over the lobby is a bust of George H.W. Bush, who served as CIA director in the 1970s before his time as vice president and president.

Historian and author Elizabeth Cobbs said that Tubman was a perfect and “worthy” choice for the spy agency, and that this was not a case of promoting diversity at the expense of history.

“This is very meaningful,” said Cobbs, who wrote a historical novel about Tubman’s role gathering intelligence for the Union Army, ""The Tubman Command.""

“She was a kick-ass spy operating in extremely difficult circumstances with extremely high stakes,” said Cobbs, a professor at Texas A&M University.

Although school children are familiar with Tubman’s work helping rescue slaves and bring them to freedom in the North, when she was dubbed “Moses,” her time as a Union Army nurse and spy is often overlooked, Cobbs said.

In June 1863, Tubman played a crucial role in the planning and execution of a daring raid into Confederate territory in South Carolina, leading a team of eight scouts who gathered intelligence on enemy positions on the Combahee river.

Through her intelligence gathering, she learned that some Confederate gun emplacements had been removed and that defensive positions were lightly manned, according to Cobbs.

Tubman then took part in the raid, leading Union gunboats to strategic points near the shore where fleeing slaves were waiting.

The operation came off without a hitch and with no Union Army losses. More than 750 slaves were liberated, a pontoon bridge destroyed and troops disembarked to torch valuable Confederate property, including plantations, fields, mills, warehouses and mansions.

Newspaper accounts in the North hailed the raid and credited an unnamed Black woman as the mastermind of the effort, a “she Moses.” Her role in the operation made her the first American woman to command an armed military raid, and last year, Tubman was accepted into the U.S. Army Military Intelligence Corps Hall.

After the war, Tubman had financial struggles and was denied repeated requests for a Union Army pension, which was awarded to Black soldiers who took part in the same raid. After 30 years, she was granted a pension for her work as a nurse, not as a soldier and an intelligence officer.

The statue at the CIA is a copy of an original sculpture by American artist Brian Hanlon, which is in Auburn, New York, where Tubman settled after the Civil War.

“We wanted to find a statue that showed her in the vibrancy of youth, showing her in action,” Beyer said. “She is striding forward, holding up a lantern, which is something she might have done on a river bank to signal to the other side that she was there to be picked up to be taken to a safe house on the underground railroad.”

Frederick Douglass, the former slave who rose to fame as an eloquent crusader for the abolition of slavery and equal rights, knew Tubman and wrote to federal authorities endorsing her request for an Army pension.

In a letter to Tubman, Douglass wrote that he had enjoyed public acclaim and plaudits as an orator, while she had risked her life in secret to liberate enslaved African Americans.

“The midnight sky and the silent stars have been the witnesses of your devotion to freedom and of your heroism,” he wrote."
Paralysed woman forced to go to bank by ambulance to renew ATM card,https://www.thevibes.com/articles/news/70364/paralysed-woman-forced-to-go-bank-by-ambulance-to-renew-atm-card,nottheonion,"KUALA LUMPUR – A paralysed and sickly woman had to be taken by ambulance to a bank in Gurun, Kedah to renew her almost-expired ATM card.

This major inconvenience was due to the bank’s refusal to help ease the card renewal process, alleged the woman’s daughter known as Nur Hatini.

She shared the ordeal in a TikTok video, which so far garnered 1.1 million views, more than 48,000 likes and 5,000 comments.

Nur Hatini claimed that she tried to contact the bank to ask for an easier way to renew the ATM card, without her mother having to go to the bank.

However, she was told that her mother had to be physically there at the bank outlet, and because of that, the family had to pay for ambulance services.

This did not sit well with most commenters and a consumer advocate as they condemned the bank for being inflexible.

Malaysia Consumer Movement secretary Sukhdave Singh urges banks to show more concern for their sickly customers.

“There is no point in publicising their corporate social responsibility work when they cannot accommodate their customers.

“The bank could have asked for proof from the family about the woman’s health and sent an officer to her house to sort it out,” he told Getaran, The Vibes’s Bahasa Malaysia news portal.

He also urged Bank Negara Malaysia to draw up guidelines on banking services for sick customers.

Other commenters seemed to agree, especially for the bank involved to be more proactive.

“It’s already 2022, there must be a better way for those who are terribly ill to attend to their banking affairs,” said a user known as Ibrahim Baim.

“Why can’t the bank send an officer to the house?” asked user Pandadada.

Some commenters even suggested that the family closes the account to teach the bank a lesson.

There were those who shared their experiences where other banks would be accommodating.

“I only had to drive my dad to the car park outside a bank outlet. An officer came out to help us renew my dad’s ATM card,” said a user named KakMunah1979.

User Faizal_Sidam said when his mother-in-law was bedridden, a bank officer showed up at her house to help sort out her banking issues. – The Vibes, September 3, 2022"

DETROIT (AP) — Anyone who has ever been temporarily blinded by high-beam headlights from an oncoming car will be happy to hear this.

U.S. highway safety regulators are about to allow new high-tech headlights that can automatically tailor beams so they focus on dark areas of the road and don’t create glare for oncoming drivers.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says it issued a final rule allowing what’s called “adaptive driving beam headlights” on new vehicles. It will go into effect when published in the Federal Register in the next few days.

The headlights, commonly used in Europe, have LED lamps that can focus beams on darkness such as the driver’s lane and areas along the roadside. They also lower the intensity of the light beams if there’s oncoming traffic. Camera sensors and computers help determine where the light should go.

“This final rule will improve safety for pedestrians and bicyclists by making them more visible at night, and will help prevent crashes by better illuminating animals and objects in and along the road,” the agency said in a news release on Tuesday.

The new rule, which was supported by the auto industry, comes as the safety agency grapples with a dramatic rise in traffic deaths nationwide.

The number of U.S. traffic deaths surged in the first nine months of 2021 to 31,720, the government reported Tuesday, keeping up a record pace of increased dangerous driving during the coronavirus pandemic.

The estimated figure of people dying in motor vehicle crashes from January to September 2021 was 12% higher than the same period in 2020. That represents the highest percentage increase over a nine-month period since the Transportation Department began recording fatal crash data in 1975.

The tally of 31,720 deaths was the highest nine-month figure since 2006.

Sam Abuelsamid, principal mobility analyst for Guidehouse Research, said the new lights will show up in higher-cost luxury vehicles at first, but will spread to more mainstram vehicles as the price of the technology falls.

Currently Audi charges $3,000 for the top version of the lights in the U.S. on its e-tron Sportback electric vehicle. The adaptive beam lights are offered on most Audi models in the U.S., but until now, could not be used. An Audi spokesman says the company is evaluating whether the lights meet NHTSA standards and whether they can be activated in the future.

The technology uses an array of light emitting diodes that can change where light beams are sent, rather than the current technology of high beams hitting everywhere. “You have the ability to basically create a light pattern on the fly that is optimized for real-time conditions,” Abuelsamid said. “You can cast the light where it’s most useful.”

The new lights also will help partially automated driver assist systems keep cars in their lanes and avoid objects in front of the vehicles at night, Abuelsamid said.

The new lighting regulation also comes more than 1 1/2 years ahead of a requirement in the bipartisan infrastructure law passed by Congress last year, NHTSA said.

In the past the agency has moved slowly on safety measures mandated by Congress. An Associated Press review last year of NHTSA’s rule-making activities under the last three presidents found at least 13 auto safety rules that are years overdue based on deadlines set in laws passed by Congress.

The agency has been without a Senate-confirmed administrator since early 2017. President Joe Biden has nominated former California air quality regulator Steven Cliff for the post. Cliff is awaiting confirmation by the full Senate.

Man Hands Officers Meth Instead of Registration at Traffic Stop,https://www.wboy.com/news/crime/man-hands-officers-meth-instead-of-registration-at-traffic-stop/,nottheonion,"BRIDGEPORT, W.Va. — Two men have been charged after officers found drugs during a traffic stop in Bridgeport.

Roy Porter

On April 17, officers with the Bridgeport Police Department were conducting a traffic stop on a vehicle for improper registration while at mile marker 125 on I-79, according to a criminal complaint.

Officers spoke with the vehicle’s driver, Roy Porter, 57, who handed officers a packet that they thought was the registration of the vehicle, however, a small plastic bag fell out, officers said.

Inside the bag, were “a couple pieces of crystal-like substance,” and officers led a K9 unit around the area of the vehicle to perform a free-air sniff which resulted in a positive indication, according to the complaint.

Porter was found to be in possession of 4 grams of meth, and a passenger in the vehicle, Jared Mayle, 21, of Salem, had 220 grams of meth, officers said

Mayle has been charged with possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance. He is currently out on bond.

Porter has been charged with conspiracy to commit a felony. He is currently being held in North Central Regional Jail on $5,000 bond."
Officer husband of slain Uvalde teacher tried to save her. His gun was taken away.,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/slain-uvalde-teachers-officer-husband-tried-wife-gun-was-taken-away-rcna34710,nottheonion,"Eva Mireles’ husband, a police officer, tried to save her after she was shot at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, according to the director of the state Department of Public Safety, Col. Steven McCraw.

During a Texas Senate hearing Tuesday on the police response to the shooting, McCraw said that Mireles’ husband, Ruben Ruiz, had his gun taken away, was detained and escorted off the scene after he received a call from his wife.

“We got an officer, Officer Ruiz, whose wife had called him and said she (had) been shot and she’s dying,” McCraw said in video shared by PBS ""News Hour."" “What happened to him as he tried to move forward into the hallway, he was detained and they took his gun away from him and escorted him off the scene.”

Fourth grade teacher Mireles was one of the two educators who was killed in the school shooting on May 24, when an 18-year-old killed 19 students. Lydia Martinez Delgado told The New York Times that her niece died protecting her students.

Ruiz is an Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District officer. The couple’s daughter, Adalynn Ruiz, wrote a heartbreaking tribute following her mother’s death.

“Mom, you are a hero. I keep telling myself that this isn’t real . I just want to hear your voice,” she wrote on Facebook in part, adding, “I want everything back. I want you to come back to me mom. I miss you more than words can explain.”

Mireles’ cousin, Amber Ybarra, also spoke with ""TODAY"" after the tragic shooting, remembering her as “a hero.”

“No one walked into that school yesterday knowing that anything like this was possible,” Ybarra shared, adding that Mireles loved “what she did at the school, and she put her heart in everything that she did.”

McCraw called the police response an “abject failure” at the hearing Tuesday. His office is one of many investigating law enforcement’s response to the shooting.

He also stated that “one of the biggest problems” during the shooting was “not only the lack of leadership, but also the misinformation that’s being provided.”

“What officers were being told was, ‘The subject is contained, the chief is in the classroom or the office, negotiating or talking to the subject.' So everyone is treating it, that comes in afterwards, you’re in the hallway and you’re looking at it, and you’re being told this, there’s no reason to discount that,” he stated. “Now, certainly if you heard, ‘Well, wait a minute, we’re getting 911 calls from children in the classroom.’ And we didn’t know the timeline.”

Additionally, a new image from inside the school taken 19 minutes after the gunman started shooting appeared to show officers with more firepower and protective gear than previously thought.

“Investigators really believe at this point, based on my understanding, that that was certainly enough firepower to try and take on the gunman,” Austin American-Statesman reporter Tony Plohetski on Tuesday told NBC News correspondent Gabe Gutierrez on ""TODAY.""

The investigations will attempt to answer why officers waited more than an hour to take the gunman down."
‘HVAC Prayer’: Kentucky man turns to prayer amid heat wave,https://www.wkyt.com/2022/06/16/hvac-prayer-kentucky-man-turns-prayer-amid-heat-wave/,nottheonion,"FRANKFORT, Ky. (WKYT) - With temperatures climbing, people are trying everything they can think of to stay cool.

One Kentucky man is turning to prayer and it has gone viral.

Frankfort native Ryan Sturm posted this picture to Facebook, along with his “HVAC Prayer.”

The prayer goes:

O Lord, we pray for a hedge of protection over these vessels unto which we are not worthy. For these conditioners of air, Lord, we pray that you might fill them with a double portion of freon and an unmatched work ethic during these next couple of trying weeks in the absolute sauna that is Central KY and beyond. In Jesus name we pray. Amen.

Praying his unit be filled with a double portion of freon and an unmatched work ethic. Sturm says what was just a joke, was something he and his family really did.

“There’s satire in the prayer, but, that night, my sons and my wife and I, we prayed for our HVAC, we prayed for our HVAC that morning, we’ve prayed for our HVAC since,” Sturm said.

Sturm says he and his wife know firsthand what it’s like to not have a working air unit. In 20-19, their unit went out and their firstborn son was just three months old.

“You know tensions are high because of the baby, so my wife and I have high tension because of that and you throw in high temperatures inside with that. It was wild,” Sturm said. “I remember just it was miserable. So, I do know what it’s like to not have briefly a not working HVAC, and man it is not cool. No pun intended.”

Praying over his unit this time around, Sturm says he’s had no issues thus far.

“I think there’s real power in that prayer and God hears our prayers,” said Sturm.

With more than 36,000 shares, Sturm says he hopes people get more out of his post than just a laugh.

“A: I hope people get out of it there’s real power in prayer and, B: I hope people get out of it, it’s OK to laugh and like not to take this life here too seriously,” said Sturm.

Marjorie Taylor Greene Surprise Guest Speaker at White Supremacist Conference,https://themountain.news/news/marjorie-taylor-greene-surprise-guest-speaker-at-white-supremacist-conference,nottheonion,"A sitting member of Congress got on stage with white supremacists and extremists. Declaring them “canceled Americans” and that they were the victims of oppression, Marjorie Taylor Greene got a standing ovation.

Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene was the surprise guest speaker at a conference for white supremacists called AFPAC, or the America First Political Action Conference. A poster promoting the event shows two “mystery speakers,” one of whom was Greene. The conference is managed by Nick Fuentes, an attendant of the deadly riot in Charlottesville in 2017 and the host of an alt-right podcast by the name of “America First.” Nick Fuentes has been identified by the Justice Department as a white supremacist in an affidavit concerning one of the Capitol insurrectionists Christian Secor. Secor is defined as a “Groyper”, someone who is a fan of figures such as Nick Fuentes. AFPAC is frequented by people considered too unhinged for the Conservative Political Action Conference, also known as CPAC. AFPAC has been described by The Daily Dot as a ""white nationalist alternative"" to CPAC.

AFPAC pitches itself as an “annual assembly of the best the America First movement has to offer… AFPAC has been a shining beacon for true patriots to rally around since its inception.” The conference claims to be “a time to reflect on the success of the past year and outline the movement’s goals for the future. It is a chance to mingle with like-minded Americans fighting to save this nation. Most importantly, it is a time to showcase the power of our ideas and of our conviction in God.” This is coded language to cover that the conference centers itself around conspiracies of white people being genocided in America and that the COVID-19 pandemic was designed as a bioweapon.

While on stage, Greene prattled on about Democrats being “the communist party” and that “Big Tech” was censoring conservatives by banning them on Twitter. Greene did not call the attendants white nationalists, groypers, or any other term but “canceled Americans.” “You’ve been handed the responsibility to fight for our Constitution and stand for our freedoms, and stop the Democrats who are the communist party of the United States of America,” Greene said. Immediately after Greene’s speech, other far-right figures took the stage. “They want to replace you,” said Vincent James Foxx, a former propagandist for the white supremacist street-fighting club Rise Above Movement. “Western white culture is the majority culture, to which even non-whites assimilate into today — and they’re better off for it.” Trying to best Foxx in rhetoric, far-right podcaster Stew Peters called for the execution of Dr. Anthony Fauci, who he accused of causing the COVID-19 pandemic. “Tony Fauci literally unleashed a bio weapon on the world. Why is this man running around free instead of hanging on the end of a noose somewhere?” After every speaker the crowd cheered, egging on the extremism on stage and cheering for Putin as well.

Less than 24 hours later Greene was at CPAC. At the event, Greene immediately threw Nick Fuentes and his “groypers” under the bus by claiming she knew nothing about Nick Fuentes and that she did not know any of his views or his history of extremism. How a congresswoman was not aware that she was supporting and speaking on the stage of a man currently subpoenaed by the Select Committee to investigate the storming of the capitol is questionable. Another member of Congress, Paul Gosar of Arizona, also gave a speech at AFPAC, defending the capitol rioters and Nick Fuentes from what he claimed was persecution by the federal government. Nick Fuentes was at the Capitol on January 6th, egging on his supporters to storm the capitol. The Select Committee has subpoenaed Fuentes to gain access to information concerning the events of that day. The Federal Bureau of Investigation seized around $275,000 worth of Bitcoin donated to Fuentes due to concerns that the donation was connected to the event.

Despite being considered a radical by many in her own party, it is concerning that the far-right continues to dig their way towards the Republican party. Despite Marjorie Taylor Greene’s reputation, any inroads white nationalists make into the party of Lincoln only advances their position. The Greenes of the party are becoming bridges for extremists within the party, legitimizing their beliefs and allowing them a means to gain new followers."
Thai wife shoots husband’s penis with fishing harpoon because he didn’t cook her dinner,https://www.malaymail.com/news/life/2022/03/07/thai-wife-shoots-husbands-penis-with-fishing-harpoon-because-he-didnt-cook/2045878,nottheonion,"KUALA LUMPUR, March 7 — A man from Buriram in Thailand had a painful punishment for not cooking dinner for his wife.

According to Daily Star, angry wife Chanita Kuedrum shot her husband’s manhood with a fishing harpoon after he decided to go out for a drink with his friends instead of cooking her dinner.

The furious 43-year-old woman waited up for Boonchuey Mooseeton to teach him a painful lesson by shooting his crotch like a fish.

Boonchuey was quoted saying that his wife of 21 years then twisted the spear after shooting the base of his penis.

The incident happened after Chanita returned home from work in the fields as a sugarcane collector.

After a long day of work, she was expecting to see food on the table but instead realised that her partner had gone out with pals to drink whisky — forgetting to make his wife a meal.

It was then she decided to stay up for her husband to return home and teach him a life lesson.

The 45-year-old man was reportedly so drunk he did not seek medical attention until the next day.

His penis eventually needed 17 stitches.

Boonchuey, however, has decided to stay away from home until his wife cools down."

Ban pornography, said Ohio Senate candidate J.D. Vance.

What’s happening: According to HuffPost, Vance — a Republican Senate candidate and author of the best-selling memoir “Hillbilly Elegy” — said in a “newly unearthed” interview with a Catholic magazine in August 2021 that he wants to ban pornography.



“I think the combination of porn, abortion have basically created a lonely, isolated generation that isn’t getting married, they’re not having families, and they’re actually not even totally sure how to interact with each other,” Vance told Crisis Magazine at a conference for young conservatives.

Vance’s campaign “didn’t provide a comment about his more recent thoughts on porn, and how they would factor into his priorities as a senator,” HuffPost writes.

Vance won Ohio’s Senate Republican primary earlier this month after being endorsed by former President Donald Trump, according to The Guardian.

In a statement following the Uvalde, Texas, mass shooting that killed 19 children and two adults, Vance blamed a lack of familial support, saying, “We need to address the culture of fatherlessness and drug addiction in our country, focus on the importance of family so that our next generation is guided and empowered with strong support systems.”

Republican stance on porn: Although they haven’t called for an outright ban on pornography, the Republican Party in 2016 declared it a “public health crisis that is destroying the life of millions,” according to CNN.



Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., made headlines last fall when he blamed efforts to fight toxic masculinity for pushing men to pornography.

“Can we be surprised that after years of being told that they are the problem, that their manhood is the problem, more and more men are withdrawing into the enclave of idleness and pornography and video games?” Hawley said, according to The Guardian.

In 2020, Utah passed a law that requires pornographic materials be labeled with a warning saying, “Exposing minors to obscene material may damage or negatively impact minors.”"
"Man Who ‘Hasn’t Stopped Farting Since Eating Ham Roll In 2017’ Is Suing For $250,000",https://www.bolde.com/man-farting-ham-roll-suing-250k/,nottheonion,"A British man who claims he’s been dealing with uncontrollable flatulence since eating a ham roll from a Christmas market in 2017 is suing for nearly $250,000. Tyrone Prades, 46, says he’s never been the same since and his wind is so bad, it often wakes him up in the night now.

Prades is suing the company that operated the stall. They sold him the ham roll, so Prades believes they’re liable for the physical damage he’s experienced since. He believes that damage is worth nearly a quarter of a million dollars. He says he got sick within hours after eating the sandwich. After buying the roll at the Christmas market in Birmingham, he felt ill within a few hours. He said it got progressively worse after a few hours, leaving Prades with a high-grade fever and severe diarrhea. Prades was apparently in bed for five weeks afterward. This wasn’t your normal case of food poisoning. In fact, his lawyer, Robert Parkin, claims he was laid up for more than a month after contracting salmonella from the stall. He goes on to say that others were also affected, though it’s unclear whether or not there are other suits. The man claims his ongoing gas is a serious problem. Parkin said on Prades’ behalf: “The claimant continues to suffer from excessive flatulence, which causes him a great deal of embarrassment. The symptoms are, primarily, fatigue and altered bowel function associated with ‘churning’ within his abdomen and flatulence. The claimant’s stomach continues to make frequent churning noises to the extent his sleep can become disrupted. The extent of the symptoms has been life-changing.” There was allegedly a Public Health England investigation that led to the stall being closed. Parkin said that “a total of 16 people in three groups complained of similar symptoms after eating at the stall.” The company is said to be disputing the size of the claim. The case is due to go to court at a later date."
State rep. floats mandatory vasectomies for all boys as his state nears nation’s strictest abortion law,https://www.pennlive.com/news/2022/05/state-rep-floats-mandatory-vasectomies-for-all-boys-as-his-state-nears-nations-strictest-abortion-law.html?outputType=amp,nottheonion,"While Oklahoma is gearing up to enact the most restrictive reproductive law in the country, outlawing abortion at fertilization, one of the state’s lawmakers is proposing an entirely different way at looking at things.

And it is probably not going to go over well with men in the state.

That’s because, according to reports, state rep. Mickey Dollens floated the idea last week of legislation that would mandate vasectomies for every boy in the state once they hit puberty. Dollens said that the vasectomy would only be “reversible when they reach the point of financial and emotional stability.”

“If you think that is crazy then I think that maybe you understand how 50 percent of Oklahomans feel, as well,” the Democrat reportedly told a group of GOP lawmakers.

Oklahoma’s legislature passed the abortion ban at the point of fertilization on Thursday, and it is set to go before Gov. Kevin Stitt, who has said he will sign it into law. According to reports, that bill would define “fertilization” as the moment that the sperm meets the egg.

It would reportedly allow exceptions that include saving the life of the pregnant mother or in cases where pregnancy resulted from rape or incest.

Dollens said he is thinking of introducing his mandatory vasectomy bill next year."
Musk posts baseless conspiracy theory about Paul Pelosi attack on Twitter,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/30/elon-musk-twitter-baseless-conspiracy-theory-paul-pelosi-attack,nottheonion,"Elon Musk was criticized on Sunday after posting a baseless conspiracy theory about the assault of Paul Pelosi to Twitter – the social media giant he took over several days ago with a promise to impose fewer restrictions on its content.

Paul Pelosi, husband of US House speaker Nancy Pelosi, was attacked with a hammer at their California home on Friday. The attacker, identified by authorities as David DePape, allegedly said “Where is Nancy?” during the attack; Joe Biden said that she appeared to be the intended target.

Musk’s sharing of the conspiracy theory stemmed from a tweet by Hillary Clinton on Saturday. The Democratic former senator shared a Los Angeles Times story about DePape’s apparent far-right leanings.

“The Republican party and its mouthpieces now regularly spread hate and deranged conspiracy theories,” Clinton said, according to the Los Angeles Times. “It is shocking, but not surprising, that violence is the result. As citizens, we must hold them accountable for their words and the actions that follow.”

Musk responded by tweeting that “there is a tiny possibility there might be more to this story than meets the eye,” and shared a link to a post that presented an unfounded conspiracy theory on the hammer attack, the Times reported. This conspiracy post was in the Santa Monica Observer, which the Times described as being “notorious for publishing false news”.

Dan Moynihan, a public policy professor at Georgetown University, said in the wake of Musk’s tweet: “A big problem in contemporary American politics is that one party has become obsessed with conspiracy theories, encouraging radical responses including anti-democratic actions and violence. Musk will just make the problem worse.”

Musk deleted the response by early Sunday afternoon, according to NBC News. Prior to its deletion, however, it had received in excess of 24,000 retweets and 86,000 likes.

“The latest conspiracy theory about Paul Pelosi’s attack is frankly too disgusting to print,” said NBC News reporter Ben Collins, in response to Musk’s retweet.

The world’s richest man’s apparent sharing of this post comes amid concern that hate-speech and harassment will run rampant under his leadership. Musk has tried to ease concerns about an increase in harmful posts under his ownership, such as his announcement that there would be a new content moderation counsel.

Musk suggested that a better approach would be to divide Twitter into various strands. This approach would see users applying content ratings on their posts, and engaging in online disputes, within a special space on the platform.

Joburg man behind bars for presenting fraudulent sick note to employer,https://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-and-courts/joburg-man-behind-bars-for-presenting-fraudulent-sick-note-to-employer-047887d7-0589-415c-9fb9-f1b0fd792cce,nottheonion,"Pretoria – The Health Professions Council of South Africa’s (HPCSA) says a man was arrested for submitting a fraudulent medical certificate to his employer. “The HPCSA Inspectorate Office conducted a joint operation with the Ekurhuleni East crime intelligence unit and the Germiston Flying Squad where the man was arrested for submitting a fraudulent medical certificate to his employer,” said HPCSA spokesperson Christopher Tsatsawane.

“During the operation, the man was found having purchased a fraudulent medical certificate under the name of Dr IK Mukhere. During investigation, the man indicated his willingness to accompany the operation team to Tembisa to point out the individual from whom he purchased the medical certificate,” he said. However, Tsatsawane said upon arrival in Tembisa, the man failed to cooperate further. “He was arrested and taken into custody at the Primrose South African Police Service (SAPS) whereby he was charged with fraud. The matter is still under investigation as to the individual who issued the fraudulent documents to the suspect, who conducted himself fraudulently and contravening the Health Professions Act, 56 of 1974.

“The HPCSA believes that working in collaboration with law enforcement agencies, other regulatory bodies, the media and the general public, is a collective responsibility to ensure that illegal practitioners are exposed, and most importantly, reported, so that they may be prosecuted,” said Tsatsawane. The Health Professions Council of South Africa is a statutory body established under the Health Professions Act 56 of 1974, and it is mandated to regulate the health professions in the country in aspects pertaining to education, training and registration, professional conduct and ethical behaviour, ensuring Continuing Professional Development (CPD), and fostering compliance with healthcare standards. In order to safeguard the public and guiding the health professions in South Africa, registration in terms of the Health Professions Act is a prerequisite for practising any of the health professions registrable with the HPCSA."
Athlete Loses Race in Colombia After His Penis Came Out in The Middle of The Run,https://www.news18.com/news/buzz/athlete-loses-race-in-colombia-after-his-penis-came-out-in-the-middle-of-the-run-5693131.html,nottheonion,"In an unfortunate turn of events, an athlete lost a 400-meter race at the 2022 World Athletics U20 Championships due to a wardrobe malfunction. 18-year-old Alberto Nonino, who hails from Italy, was competing in the 400-meter of decathlon in Cali, Colombia when the incident took place. Alberto Nonino started off extremely well by gaining pace against his competitors, leaving the bystanders under the impression that he might win the race with quite ease. However, after Nonino passed the middle lane, he looked uncomfortable and kept reaching down to hold his crotch a couple of times. At the time, viewers did not know what went wrong, but Nonino’s pace decreased a tad bit, allowing his competitors to overtake him. The athlete, unfortunately, finished last with a time record of 51.57 seconds.

As per LADbible, sports journalist David Sanchez de Castro reported that Alberto Nonino’s penis kept falling out of his shorts. The incident did not allow him to run properly during the race. The 18-year-old athlete did try to tackle the issue but nothing worked in his favour at the moment.

Watch the footage of the race below:

https://twitter.com/SanchezdeCastro/status/1554781811879907331

As reported by the portal, Alberto Nonino took to Instagram after the match to open up about the unfortunate incident. The 18-year-old said he is aware that the incident has created a buzz on social media but he requested netizens to stop sending him links to blogs and posts about it. He added it was an ‘accident’.

“I just want to talk to you a little bit about the rumpus there’s been on blogs and social media in general. I’m conscious it was obviously an accident and I’d like to tell you I’m aware of the reaction and you don’t need to send me the links to the blogs out there,” Nonino said in an Instagram story. He explained that the entire situation appears to be funny for him now, however, after he finished the match, the athlete felt ‘terrible’. It is his family and friends who are helping him get over the incident.

“I’m trying to laugh about it now but immediately afterward I felt terrible and I’m thankful to my friends and family for helping me get over what happened a few hours later,” he continued. While concluding his statement, Nonino highlighted that all the articles around the incident haven’t affected him due to his optimistic approach but if it were for a more sensitive person, the result could have been devastating.

"Gohmert: ‘If you’re a Republican, you can’t even lie to Congress or lie to an FBI agent or they’re coming after you’",https://thehill.com/homenews/house/3511477-gohmert-if-youre-a-republican-you-cant-even-lie-to-congress-or-lie-to-an-fbi-agent-or-theyre-coming-after-you/,nottheonion,"Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) railed against the indictment of former Trump White House adviser Peter Navarro while saying in an interview on Friday that “if you’re a Republican, you can’t even lie to Congress or lie to an FBI agent or they’re coming after you.”

Gohmert, speaking to Newsmax in an interview on Friday, was asked to comment on the Friday indictment of Navarro by a federal grand jury after the former Trump official failed to comply with the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.

“It actually puts an exclamation point on the fact that we have a two-tiered justice system. If you’re a Republican, you can’t even lie to Congress or lie to an FBI agent or they’re coming after you. They’re gonna bury you. They’re gonna put you in the D.C. jail and terrorize and torture you and not live up to the Constitution there,” Gohmert responded.

He argued that there was a double standard to how Democrats and Republicans were being treated, pointing to the acquittal of prominent Democratic attorney Michael Sussmann, who was being investigated by special counsel John Durham, as one example.

“So [it’s] very clear. If you’re a Democrat, then you can lie. You can cheat. You can do whatever you want,” he said.

The Hill has reached out to Gohmert’s office for further comment and clarification on his remarks.

The development comes against the backdrop of Navarro’s indictment, who is facing two charges of criminal contempt of Congress after being subpoenaed by the House select committee.

The committee is interested in hearing from the former Trump official, looking to hear possible evidence regarding efforts to have the 2020 election results overturned by allies of former President Trump.

“Who are these people?” Navarro asked during his court appearance on Friday. “This is not America. I mean, I was a distinguished public servant for four years and nobody ever questioned my ethics. And they’re treating me in this fashion.”"
Nation’s first vaginal fluid transplants offer hope for millions,https://www.wbur.org/news/2022/08/05/vagina-microbiome-transfer-bacterial-vaginosis-bv-treatment,nottheonion,"Her experience of having BV return just weeks after treatment is common. The standard medical treatment — antibiotics — has been unchanged for 40 years. Yet one month after taking antibiotics, there is a 40 to 60% chance the BV will have come back .

“I have tried everything,” she said. “And it’s just so uncomfortable.”

In Genga’s years-long attempt to get rid of BV, she tried medications, over-the-counter products, and holistic treatments. She’s tried changing her diet, her soap, her feminine products.

The experience can be different for different people. Indeed, most with BV report no symptoms. But for others, there can be discharge, odor and sometimes itching.

BV happens when the natural bacteria in a vagina get out of balance.

This summer Massachusetts General Hospital started performing the first vaginal fluid transplants in the U.S. After years of delays, the hope is that this study will offer insights that can help the estimated 21 million Americans, from teenagers to middle-aged women, who have BV.

She is far from alone. At any given moment, almost one in three women in the U.S. has BV, and the numbers are even higher for certain groups. More than 50% of African American women have the condition. BV has been linked to serious long-term health issues and yet, for many people, medicine does not have a good treatment.

“I started to not like my own body because it was fighting me all the time,” said Genga, who is from Rhode Island.

At first it seemed like just a nuisance. After her gynecologist diagnosed her with bacterial vaginosis — or BV — she took a course of antibiotics and things seemed better. But three weeks later, it was back. Another round of antibiotics helped, but only for four weeks. It came back again.

""The fact that there hasn't been a new treatment is infuriating as a health care provider — and as a woman.""

“The fact that there hasn't been a new treatment is infuriating as a health care provider — and as a woman,” said Caroline Mitchell, director of the MGH’s Vulvovaginal Disorders Program.

Mitchell said her patients often describe antibiotics as temporary relief rather than a treatment. And the problem is deeper than the immediate discomfort. BV is associated with a host of serious health issues regardless of whether the person experiences any symptoms.

BV is linked to preterm birth. It's linked to a higher risk of acquiring HIV or other sexually transmitted infections. It’s linked to the persistence of human papillomavirus and progression to cervical pre-cancer. It seems to be associated with infertility.

And it impacts more than just the individual.

“It really strikes at the core of their relationships. It makes them feel uncomfortable with intimacy with a partner. It makes them feel ashamed,” said Mitchell.

After years of failed treatments, one Sunday morning, Genga was so fed up with BV that she made herself a cup of tea and sat down at her computer. She spent the next several hours digging through medical journals to find some hint of hope. Eventually, she found what she was looking for.

The superhero bacterium

Genga stumbled across Mitchell’s lab, where after years of work and setbacks, Mitchell’s team was experimenting with vaginal fluid transplants.

The idea is simple: Take fluid from a happy vagina and put it in an unhappy one.

The science behind it is all about bacteria. Every person has trillions of bacteria living on and in their body. In most parts of the body, like the gut, having a lot of different types of bacteria is a good thing.

“But in the vagina, it's really that simplicity is better,” said Mitchell.

What she wants to see under the microscope is just one type of bacterium dominating. It’s called Lactobacillus crispatus and some within the scientific community have nicknamed it the “superhero of the vagina.” It’s not the same lactobacilli in dairy products nor the one found it in the gut. Mitchell said the type found in the vagina is totally different and she credits it with “creating this very stable, peaceful, calm environment in the vagina.”

Nobody really knows how the special power works. But Mitchell thinks it comes from the fact that this type of bacteria makes lactic acid which keeps the vagina relatively acidic. Scientists have discovered this environment is also correlated with less inflammation. When looking at HIV, researchers found that the virus moves more slowly in an acidic environment and, when there’s less inflammation, there are fewer targets for the virus.

But it’s been hard to study the superhero. As far as experts can tell, no animal — besides humans — has a vagina dominated by lactobacillus. Not baboons. Not chimpanzees. Not mice. And that makes it impossible to do animal studies to test things out before trying it in human subjects.

So, the work must happen in humans. Mitchell has a team of vaginal fluid donors who insert a menstrual cup at night and come by the lab in the morning to drop off the liquid that’s been collected. They are screened for all kinds of infections, can’t travel to places where the Zika virus is common, and must abstain from sex to avoid a stray sperm sneaking into the donation.

After months of painstakingly collecting the fluid — one tiny donation at a time — the actual transplant is easy. No operating room, no scalpels needed.

“We just use an eyedropper, and we do a speculum exam,” Mitchell said. “With the eyedropper, just put the fluid into the vagina. We have the person lay there for 15 minutes, and that's it.”

The scientific community is watching to see if the superhero goes into action.

‘A new emerging field’

“I think this is a very interesting study. It's a new emerging field,” said Anke Hemmerling, who is at the University of California, San Francisco, and not involved in Mitchell’s transplant study. Hemmerling’s own team is working on growing lactobacillus superheros in the lab and producing them as a powder for people to apply. So far, study results are promising.

She’s eager to see Mitchell’s results once the study concludes — as well as the findings from similar transplant studies in Denmark and Israel — but she worries the whole transplant approach is hard to standardize and too complicated logistically.

“You obviously have to check for a whole slew of different things,” she said. “You have to make sure that the donor sample is free of infectious diseases, that the woman doesn't have a yeast infection, that the woman doesn't have bacterial vaginosis.”

Plus, if it works, she said, what will the Food and Drug Administration think?

“Would they look at it as a drug? Would they look at it more along the lines of a tissue transplant or like a blood transfusion?” Hemmerling asked.

The answer, she said, is that nobody knows for sure and that could make approval of any product complicated.

Mitchell agrees. She said transplants likely aren’t the long-term, large-scale answer. Instead, she’s hopeful that by transplanting everything in the fluid it will show whether the superhero needs a side-kick — or two — to do its magic.

Any new products are still at least a few years away from being available to the general public. But Jade Genga didn’t have to wait.

After desperately poring over medical journals, she started reaching out to researchers. Recently, she got a call: She’d be the first patient in Mitchell’s transplant study.

“I actually burst into tears,” she recalled. “My boyfriend was like, ‘Are you OK? What is going on?’ ”

What was going on is that, for the first time in a long time, Genga felt hopeful about her own prognosis, even though neither she nor the scientists know yet whether the transplants will work. Still, Genga said, maybe one day others won’t have to go through the pain and embarrassment of bacterial vaginosis."

Judge acquits doctor accused of sexual assault by accepting argument that woman can't tell the difference between their vagina and anus,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/complaints-filed-sask-judge-sexual-assault-regina-1.6496020,nottheonion,"WARNING: This story contains details some readers may find disturbing

Another complaint has been filed ​​against a ​judge ​​who recently found a former Regina doctor not guilty of sexually assaulting several patients.

Last month, Court of Queen's Bench Justice Brian Scherman acquitted Sylvester Ukabam of seven counts of sexual assault alleged to have happened between 2010 and 2017.

Two of the women who testified against the former doctor have filed complaints this month to the Canadian Judicial Council, a national body that oversees country's federal judges, regarding Scherman's decision. The most recent complaint was filed June 17, 2022, by a woman who cannot be named because of a publication ban.

​She is one of five women who ac​cused Ukabam of touching them inappropriately during medical exams.​ ​

In her complaint about the judge, the woman noted that the former doctor's lawyer argued that the victims confused rectal penetration with vaginal penetration, given the proximity and location of the two body parts.

""The judge accepted this argument,"" she wrote in her complaint. The judge indicated in his written decision that the women were mistaken about what they felt happened.

She said there can be no mistake.

""I am 100 per cent confident that Sylvester Ukabam stuck his finger in my vagina … and never performed a rectal exam,"" she wrote. ""As women, we are not confused. This is an outdated gender bias.""

In a statement to the media, the woman added that the verdict was revictimizing, and said the most distressing part was that the judge's decision suggested women were unaware of the difference between their own distinct, separate body parts.

""I believe it is outrageous that Judge Scherman made the assumption that women are incapable of telling the difference between their vagina and rectum being touched.""

She wrote in her complaint that the judge found her testimony unreliable and referred to her ""panicked"" state during the alleged assault. She said the judge ""still buys into the outdated belief that women are too emotional and irrational to be believed,"" and that given his rationale, she wondered ""if his decisions are based on outdated, sexist and misogynist personal beliefs.""

In her statement to media, she questions how a person would not be emotional when testifying about being assaulted by their doctor.

In his decision, Scherman said the case came down to the reliability of evidence and that he found no reason why he should not believe Ukabam, who was ""logical and consistent"" in his testimony.

She believes the judge ignored evidence and testimony, was biased, relied on opinion and made assumptions. She wrote that it is her ""obligation as a Canadian to tell the truth on the stand when under oath, [but] it is also my duty as a woman who is deserving the dignity of being treated with equal respect within our courts.""

Review expected to take months

On Tuesday, the Canadian Judicial Council confirmed it has received more than one complaint in relation to this case. It said the review is still in its very early stages and could take between three and six months.

""The matter may be closed under the authority of the Executive Director; the judge and his or her Chief Justice may be asked to provide comments which would be reviewed by a member of the Judicial Conduct Committee; and if the views of more than one conduct committee member are deemed helpful, a matter could go to a review panel,"" the council's spokesperson wrote in an email.

​As for the court process, the​ Crown ​has filed a notice of appeal, arguing that the judge erred by dismissing its application to admit similar fact evidence, failed to consider the totality of evidence and speculated about matters not in evidence.

Ukabam's lawyer​ has indicated he plans to file a cross-appeal."

Oregon romance novelist who wrote ‘How to Murder Your Husband’ goes on trial in fatal shooting of longtime spouse in Portland,https://www.oregonlive.com/crime/2022/04/oregon-romance-novelist-who-wrote-how-to-murder-your-husband-goes-on-trial-in-fatal-shooting-of-longtime-spouse-in-portland.html,nottheonion,"Loving wife or a cold-blooded killer?

Teams of prosecutors and defense attorneys painted two drastically divergent portraits of Oregon romance novelist Nancy Crampton Brophy as opening statements for the first murder jury trial in Multnomah County Circuit Court in more than two years began Monday.

Crampton Brophy has remained in custody since she was arrested Sept. 5, 2018, facing a single count of murder in the fatal shooting of her husband, chef Daniel Brophy, 63, as he prepped for work at the Oregon Culinary Institute in Southwest Portland around 7:30 a.m. June 2.

Multnomah County Senior Deputy District Attorney Shawn Overstreet told jurors that Crampton Brophy was motivated by greed and a $1.4 million insurance policy.

She “executed what she perhaps believed to be the perfect plan,” Overstreet said, when the then-68-year-old allegedly followed her husband to work and shot him in the back, piercing his spine and heart, before firing again as he lay sprawled on a classroom floor.

Either shot from the Glock pistol could have been fatal, Overstreet said.

“All of the leads that detectives followed up with all pointed back at Nancy Brophy,” Overstreet said.

Lead defense attorney Lisa Maxfield said the novelist and her finances both deteriorated after the killing, far from the prosecution’s claim that she profited from ill-gotten gains. Crampton Brophy wasn’t listed on the deed to the couple’s home and grief prevented her from returning to her day job selling Medicare policies, Maxfield said.

Crampton Brophy lost “a great listener, a wonderful lover, a consummate chef and true life partner,” Maxfield said.

The “circumstantial case” against Crampton Brophy “begs you to cast a blind eye to the most powerful evidence of all: love,” the defense attorney said. Her client had no reason to kill her husband, Maxfield said.

Crampton Brophy will take the stand in her own defense, Maxfield said.

Daniel Brophy was the only person inside the culinary school at the time of his death, the prosecutor said. The school had no security cameras, he said.

Detectives found no signs of a robbery, Overstreet noted, as Brophy’s wallet, keys and phone were left untouched.

Brophy’s death remained a mystery until his wife’s arrest, and authorities have never publicly disclosed another suspect in the case.

Traffic cameras show Crampton Brophy’s minivan approaching and departing from city streets near the institute close to the apparent time of the shooting, providing a 13-minute window when she could have fatally shot her partner of 21 years, Overstreet said.

Crampton Brophy stood to collect not only the life insurance from Daniel Brophy’s death, but also the equity in their Beaverton home and a worker’s compensation plan, he said.

“Nancy Brophy was maintaining all those life insurance policies while continuing down a path of financial ruin,” he said. “Well over a thousand dollars a month was being paid into these policies at a time when they were struggling to pay their mortgage.”

Overstreet said Crampton Brophy used a Glock pistol she bought at a Portland gun show to shoot her husband, after previously buying a “ghost gun” assembly kit online that she lacked the know-how to actually build.

She then allegedly swapped out the gun’s barrel with an identical mechanism, he said, preventing forensic experts from matching the spent bullets with the original slide-racking system, which law enforcement officers were never able to recover.

Maxfield, one of two defense lawyers, said Crampton Brophy had worked as a salesperson for a variety of insurance companies and had an incentive to buy multiple policies when she changed jobs to demonstrate her belief in the product and because she received a commission.

The ghost gun kit, Maxfield said, was purchased as research for Crampton Brophy’s novels, as was the replacement gun barrel.

And Maxfield said the defense team would present evidence showing that Daniel Brophy was well aware of the various retirement plans the couple had, including the insurance policies.

Daniel Brophy even signed for the package containing the gun assembly kit while Crampton Brophy was traveling for work, she added.

The Brophys had about $10,000 available at the time of Daniel Brophy’s death and stood to make at least $700,000 when they subdivided their half-acre Beaverton property on Southwest 108th Avenue, Maxfield told a jury of seven men and 11 women, including alternate jurors.

“Nancy has always been thoroughly, madly, crazily in love with Dan Brophy, and she remains so to this day,” Maxfield said, citing letters Crampton Brophy wrote to her husband as well as a voicemail saved on his phone.

The Brophys held a large wedding ceremony in 1997 but weren’t legally married until shortly before Daniel Brophy’s killing when they signed the official paperwork in Washington County, Maxfield said. In the meantime, though, they had filed taxes as a couple.

Maxfield didn’t address the surveillance footage allegedly placing Crampton Brophy’s minivan near the crime scene or address Overstreet’s arguments that the novelist wasn’t forthcoming with detectives about the ghost gun or what she did the morning Daniel Brophy died. Maxfield said the jury would hear testimony from psychologists showing how the wallop of traumatic events can erase memories.

Before the jury entered the room, Circuit Judge Christopher Ramras ruled prosecutors cannot introduce as evidence an essay titled “How to Murder Your Husband” that Crampton Brophy wrote in 2011 while applying to a writer’s group.

Crampton Brophy joined the Romance Writers of America in 2003, according to an online biography, and had published at least a half-dozen novels.

“None of them led to much financial success,” Overstreet said.

The trial is expected to last seven weeks.

The extent of their injuries is unknown.

""Fire crews have eliminated pulling them straight out of a tank,"" Brad Wolfe, communications supervisor for Lancaster County 911 dispatch, told CNN earlier on Thursday. ""They have to cut a hole in the side of the tank to get them out,"" he said.

Wolfe said that it's unclear how the people fell into the chocolate tank.

A company spokesperson for Mars Wrigley factory said, ""We can confirm both external contractors have been taken offsite for further evaluation and normal operations at our Elizabethtown site have resumed. We are extremely grateful for the quick work of the first responders.""

OSHA has six months to conduct the investigation and release their findings.

Ottawa is redoing Valentine's Day on March 14 because of the convoy protest,https://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/ottawa-is-redoing-valentine-s-day-on-march-14-because-of-the-convoy-protest-1.5792810,nottheonion,"Did you forget Valentine’s Day this year, or wish you had celebrated it differently? If you live in Ottawa, you have a rare chance at a do-over.

Ottawa city council unanimously approved a motion to redo Valentine’s Day on March 14 this year, in the wake of the three-week Freedom Convoy protest that took over the city’s downtown.

""Our heart-shaped city needs a little love,"" said Coun. Mathieu Fleury, who presented the motion.

The protest and occupation of streets in downtown Ottawa forced many restaurants and businesses to close during Valentine's Day, a busy period for local businesses.

""Ottawa is healing from the recent downtown occupation which overran the heart of our city for three weeks,"" Fleury said, noting Valentine's Day was not the same for downtown businesses because of the protest. ""There was a significant impact to Ottawa businesses.""

The motion directs the city's communications and economic development staff to work with local BIAs and Ottawa Tourism to promote and encourage residents to shop, stay and dine local during the weekend leading up to and on March 14.

""It shows that all of the city, all of the residents regardless of where they live are concerned about what happened in our core and all want to pull together to bring some positivity back to the city, support the businesses,"" Coun. Keith Egli said, noting a constituent in his ward proposed the idea of a Valentine's Day in March.

WELCOME NEWS TO BUSINESSES

At Scrim's Florist, the Valentine's Day redo is welcome news, after seeing less foot traffic on Feb. 14.

""I think it’s great that the city has thought about small businesses and what impact the last Feb. 14 might have had on them,"" owner Susan Murray said Wednesday.

""So I think it’s wonderful and another opportunity for people to share their love.""

Republican committee sues Google over email spam filters,https://apnews.com/article/technology-presidential-elections-midterm-government-and-politics-26d755827b930d8c8d51d2aeb176e044,nottheonion,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The Republican National Committee has filed a lawsuit against tech giant Google, alleging the company has been suppressing its email solicitations ahead of November’s midterm elections — an allegation Google denies.

The lawsuit, filed in the District Court for the Eastern District of California Friday evening, accuses Gmail of “discriminating” against the RNC by unfairly sending the group’s emails to users’ spam folders, impacting both fundraising and get-out-the-vote efforts in pivotal swing states.

“Enough is enough — we are suing Google for their blatant bias against Republicans,” said RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel in a statement to The Associated Press. “For ten months in a row, Google has sent crucial end-of-month Republican GOTV and fundraising emails to spam with zero explanation. We are committed to putting an end to this clear pattern of bias.”

Google, in a statement, denied the charges. “As we have repeatedly said, we simply don’t filter emails based on political affiliation. Gmail’s spam filters reflect users’ actions,” said spokesperson José Castañeda, adding that the company provides training and guidelines to campaigns and works to “maximize email deliverability while minimizing unwanted spam.”

The lawsuit focuses on how Google’s Gmail, the world’s largest email service with about 1.5 billion users, screens solicitations and other material to help prevent users from being inundated by junk mail. To try to filter material that account holders may not want in their inboxes, Google and other major email providers create programs that flag communications likely to be perceived as unwelcome and move them to spam folders that typically are rarely, if ever, perused by recipients.

The suit says Google has “relegated millions of RNC emails en masse to potential donors’ and supporters’ spam folders during pivotal points in election fundraising and community building” — particularly at the end of each month, when political groups tend to send more messages. “It doesn’t matter whether the email is about donating, voting, or community outreach. And it doesn’t matter whether the emails are sent to people who requested them,” it reads.

Google contends its algorithms are designated to be neutral, but a study released in March by North Carolina State University found that Gmail was far more likely to block messages from conservative causes. The study, based on emails sent during the U.S. presidential campaign in 2020, estimated Gmail placed roughly 10% of email from “left-wing” candidates into spam folders, while marking 77% from “right-wing” candidates as spam.

Gmail rivals Yahoo and Microsoft’s Outlook were more likely to favor pitches from conservative causes than Gmail, the study found.

The RNC seized upon that study in April to call upon the Federal Election Commission to investigate Google’s “censorship” of its fundraising efforts, which it alleged amounted to an in-kind contribution to Democratic candidates and served as “a financially devastating example of Silicon Valley tech companies unfairly shaping the political playing field to benefit their preferred far-left candidates.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Since then, the commission has approved a pilot program that creates a way for political committees to get around spam filters so their fundraising emails find their way into recipients’ primary inboxes. Gmail is participating in the “ Verified Sender Program, ” which allows senders to bypasses traditional spam filters, but also gives users the option of unsubscribing from a sender. If the unsubscribe button is hit, a sender is supposed to remove that Gmail address from their distribution lists.

As of Friday evening, the RNC had not signed up to participate in the pilot program.

Republicans who have tried to cast doubt on the outcome of the 2020 election without parroting the most extreme and baseless claims about corrupted voting machines and stolen votes have often tried to blame big technology companies like Twitter and Facebook that they allege were biased against former President Donald Trump. A long list of state and local election officials, courts and members of Trump’s own administration have said there is no evidence of the mass fraud Trump alleges.

Google Is Showing Ads To Sell Your Kidney For US$1m In India,https://otakukart.com/551722/google-is-showing-ads-to-sell-your-kidney-for-1m-in-india/,nottheonion,"Despite being illegal in India, Google is currently showing advertisements of hospitals engaging in the sale of kidneys for $1 million. How true is that? Well, it’s not the hospital but the cybercriminals who have been tricking several people across Bengaluru city to sell their kidneys for a hefty sum.

Some people are desperate enough to sell their organs in exchange for money. And there come these wicked people who take advantage of these needy group and makes them fall into their trap. Doing this has eventually ruined the reputation of that particular hospital, to some extent, located in Bengaluru, India itself.

Sale of Kidney For A Million Dollar Is Nothing But A Lie

As far as the blamed organization is concerned, it’s Bangalore Baptist Hospital. A group of cyber criminals created a fake website with the name of this hospital and used it to trick people, asking for their kidneys in exchange for crores of rupees. In addition to this, they also used the name of a surgeon, more specifically, Dr.Antony Robert Charles, for the same.

Not only this, they were reported to have asked for money in advance as well, as the registration money ranged from Rs.25,000 (approx US$320) to Rs. 2,00,000 (approx US$2540). This needed to be deposited to the hospital, as shared by the fraudsters. Knowing this, the alleged doctor also filed a complaint at the Yeshwanthpur cyber-crime police station. The case didn’t stop here.

The fraudsters came into the limelight after a person is a victim and blamed the Bangalore Baptist Hospital for posting a review. In addition to this, he also asked people to contact the doctor, sharing his Whatsapp number. Fortunately, the doctor made an instant reply, saying, “Immediately the response was posted in Google stating that BBH is not responsible for kidney sale.”

Moreover, he wasn’t the only one. Three other victims also made similar complaints. On 21 July, the hospital filed an FIR at the Cyber Economic and Narcotics Crime Police Station. The doctor said, “Few more people have complained that they were cheated by some unknown persons using the hospital’s name.” He also shared the fact that the hospital still gets calls from people who are willing to sell their kidneys in exchange for a handsome amount.

The selling of organs is strictly prohibited under the law. You must know the truth. Bangalore Baptist Hospital is in no way involved in this kidney transplant procedure.

Coming across the Google advertisements for selling kidneys, some people have interestingly taken it to social media, making funny but awful comments. One person even ended up saying that they knew that iPhone 14 Pro was out. Some even shared that they have contacted them and are waiting for their response. Well, this is nothing but a fraud. Beware of this!"
Vlogger Dies After Consuming Geckos And Centipedes On Live TV,https://hasanjasim.com/PlTS,nottheonion,"Aman died after live-streaming himself eating centipedes to 15,000 followers in China.

Sun was a YouTuber on the Chinese live-streaming website DouYu. He had taken to spinning a wheel marked with various bugs, foods, and drinks and then swallowing whatever the wheel landed on live on camera as a way of gaining followers. According to the Daily Mail, the wheel contained geckos, mealworms, vinegar, eggs, centipedes, beer, and distilled whiskey. He was said to consume live geckos and insects.

The 35-year-old man from Hefei, Anhui province, was discovered unconscious and without vital signs on Saturday, with his PC still live-streaming. He apparently broadcast himself eating deadly centipedes two nights previously. His belongings, including the wheel and culinary items used in the movies, were discovered in the same room as him. His videos were then taken from the streaming service.

The sort of centipedes he ate is unclear, however most species would not kill or seriously hurt you. However, there have been cases of severe injuries and deaths caused by the bites of several venomous species.

A man trekking up to Devil’s Tea Table in the Missouri Ozarks was bitten by a large desert centipede and forced to seek medical treatment after swelling in his arm became “as big as my face,” he told USA Today. Meanwhile, according to local accounts, a Thai woman died in 2013 from acute swelling and discomfort caused by a bite from a Chinese red-headed centipede.

Bites from the golden head centipede, which can take down mice up to 15 times their own size in 30 seconds and is prevalent throughout East Asia and Australia, can cause agonizing pain. According to a research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences last year, their venom disturbs the circulatory, pulmonary, muscular, and neurological systems all at the same time.

Authorities are looking into the death and have ruled out foul play. It’s possible that further causes of his death have yet to be found. A man from Australia died recently after eating a gecko on a dare, acquiring severe salmonella, and dying 10 days later during surgery for major organ failure."
Nursing homes use lawsuits to demand friends and family pay off medical debts : Shots,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/07/28/1113134049/nursing-homes-are-suing-friends-and-family-to-collect-on-patients-bills,nottheonion,"Nursing homes are suing friends and family to collect on patients' bills

Enlarge this image toggle caption Heather Ainsworth for KHN Heather Ainsworth for KHN

ROCHESTER, N.Y. — Lucille Brooks was stunned when she picked up the phone before Christmas two years ago and learned a nursing home was suing her.

""I thought this was crazy,"" recalled Brooks, 74, a retiree who lives with her husband in a modest home in the Rochester suburbs. Brooks' brother had been a resident of the nursing home. But she had no control over his money or authority to make decisions for him. She wondered how she could be on the hook for his nearly $8,000 bill.

Brooks would learn she wasn't alone. Pursuing unpaid bills, nursing homes across this industrial city have been routinely suing not only residents but their friends and family, a KHN review of court records reveals. The practice has ensnared scores of children, grandchildren, neighbors, and others, many with nearly no financial ties to residents or legal responsibility for their debts.

The lawsuits illuminate a dark corner of America's larger medical debt crisis, which a KHN-NPR investigation found has touched more than half of all U.S. adults in the past five years.

Litigation is a frequent byproduct. About 1 in 7 adults who have had health care debt say they've been threatened with a lawsuit or arrest, according to a nationwide KFF poll conducted for this project. Five percent say they've been sued.

The nursing home industry has quietly developed what consumer attorneys and patient advocates say is a pernicious strategy of pursuing family and friends of patients despite federal law that was enacted to protect them from debt collection. ""The level of aggression that nursing homes are using to collect unpaid debt is severely increasing,"" said Lisa Neeley, a Massachusetts elder law attorney.

In Monroe County, where Rochester is located, 24 federally licensed nursing homes filed 238 debt collection cases from 2018 to 2021 seeking almost $7.6 million, KHN found. Several nursing homes did not file any lawsuits in that period.

Nearly two-thirds of the cases targeted a friend or relative. Many were accused — often without documentation — of hiding residents' assets, essentially stealing. The remaining cases targeted residents themselves or their spouses.

Nursing homes have gone after some families for tens of thousands of dollars. In a few cases, debts surpassed $100,000.

In Monroe County alone, one nursing home sued the daughter and granddaughter of a former resident. The daughter pleaded with the court to release the granddaughter, promising she would pay the $5,942 debt. Another home sued a woman twice, for her husband's and her mother's debts. Yet another claimed a woman owed $82,000 for her mother's care. The resident was, in fact, a cousin, according to court papers.

""I get calls all the time from people who are served with these lawsuits who had no idea that this was even a remote possibility, who call me crying and frantic,"" said Anna Anderson, an attorney at the nonprofit Legal Assistance of Western New York who has represented defendants in such suits, including Brooks. ""They believe not only that they're going to lose their own income and their own houses and assets, but also they're concerned that their loved ones who are still in the nursing home may be potentially kicked out.""

The legal strategy is often rooted in admissions agreements, the piles of paperwork that family or friends sometimes sign, not realizing the financial risks. ""The world of nursing facilities is a black hole for most people,"" said Eric Carlson, a longtime consumer attorney at the nonprofit Justice in Aging. ""This happens in the shadows.""

In most cases reviewed by KHN, the people sued didn't have an attorney, which can be expensive. In nearly a third, the nursing homes won default judgments because the defendants never responded, a common phenomenon in debt cases. In many cases, lawsuits sought interest rates as high as 18% on top of the debt.

Long-term care officials and attorneys say they must use the courts when bills go unpaid. ""It would be a disservice to the hospital's residents, and to Monroe County's taxpayers, to allow residents who have assets not to pay what is owed,"" said Gary Walker, a spokesperson for Monroe County, which operates Rochester's largest nursing home, Monroe Community Hospital.

From 2018 to 2021, the county filed 60 debt collection cases, including the lawsuit against Brooks, KHN found.

Nationally, Beth Martino, a spokesperson for the American Health Care Association, the largest nursing home industry group, said lawsuits against families are ""not a common occurrence.""

But consumer attorneys in California, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New York, and Ohio said they regularly see lawsuits against family and friends.

In 2020, Washington, D.C., secured an agreement with two nursing homes to stop what authorities called ""deceptive billing practices."" The homes had sued at least 15 family members, the attorney general found.

Ahmad Keshavarz, an attorney who documented debt lawsuits around New York City, said nursing homes see adult children as more appealing targets than older residents. ""Sons or daughters are more likely to have assets,"" he said. ""They have wages that can be garnished.""

In Ohio, Robyn King, a former teaching assistant from Cleveland, was sued for more than $70,000 by a nursing home where her mother had been a resident. ""The lawsuit made no sense to me since I told them I would not be personally responsible for my mom's medical expenses,"" King told a U.S. Senate committee in March. ""The stress was unbearable. I thought, 'I will not be able to afford my mortgage.'""

Trapped by Paperwork

In upstate New York, Brooks faced a smaller yet shocking bill: $7,967.05.

""People like us live on a fixed income,"" Brooks said. ""We don't have money to throw around, especially when you don't see it coming."" She was so worried she didn't tell her husband at first.

Brooks initially thought there had been a mistake. She and her brother, James Lawson, were part of a big family that moved north from Mississippi to escape segregation in the 1960s. Lawson, who was a gifted athlete despite losing an arm as a child, spent his career at the Rochester Parks and Recreation Department. Brooks worked in insurance. They lived on opposite sides of the city. ""My husband is somewhat disabled, and that keeps me pretty busy,"" said Brooks, who is also active in her church. ""My brother always took care of his own business.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Heather Ainsworth for KHN Heather Ainsworth for KHN

In summer 2019, Lawson was hospitalized after experiencing complications from a diabetes medication. The hospital released him to the county-run nursing home, and Brooks only found out a few days later. She visited her brother several times. No one talked to her about billing, she said. And she was never asked to sign anything.

After two months, Brooks' brother went home. A year later came the lawsuit.

The county alleged that Brooks should have used her brother's assets to pay his bills and that she was therefore personally responsible for his debt. Attached to the suit was an admissions agreement with what looked like Brooks' signature.

Such agreements, which can run multiple pages, have long been standard in the long-term care industry. They often designate whoever signs as a ""responsible party"" who will help the nursing home collect payments or enroll the resident in Medicaid, the government safety-net program.

Many lawyers say making a family member financially liable is unfair. ""If you bring your child to a doctor, you should pay for the child's medical care. But if your adult child brings you to a nursing home and you're 80, the law doesn't bind you to pay those bills,"" said Paul Aloi, a Rochester attorney who has represented all sides — patients, hospitals, and nursing homes — in debt collection cases.

Federal laws and regulations prohibit homes from requiring a resident's relatives or friends to financially guarantee the resident's bills. Facilities cannot even request such guarantees.

But consumer advocates say nursing homes slip the admissions agreements into papers that family members sign when an older parent or sick friend is admitted. Sometimes people are told they must sign, a violation of federal law. Sometimes there is barely any discussion. ""They are given a stack of forms and told, 'Sign here, sign there. Click here, click there,'"" said Miriam Sheline, managing attorney at Pro Seniors, a nonprofit law firm in Cincinnati.

When Chris Ferris helped admit his mother to Kirkhaven nursing home in Rochester in 2019, he said, he asked the staff whether any papers he had signed made him financially liable for her care. ""They said 'no,'"" he said.

Ferris, who was estranged from his mother, had no legal control over her finances. She had been managing her own affairs. Nevertheless, the nursing home sued Ferris two years later for nearly $11,000. ""It's not right,"" said Ferris, who is no longer speaking with his mother.

In more than a third of the cases that nursing homes filed in Monroe County against friends and relatives, the people sued had no power of attorney, limiting their access to residents' money to pay bills.

Accused of Stealing

Court records show Rochester-area nursing homes also frequently accuse family and friends of hiding residents' money and property to avoid paying the debts. The allegation is known in debt law as ""fraudulent conveyance."" But it is commonly interpreted by those being sued as an accusation of theft, which can be very frightening, consumer attorneys say.

The practice can intimidate people with means into paying debts they may not even owe, said Anderson, the legal assistance attorney. ""People see that on a lawsuit and they think they're being accused of stealing,"" she said. ""It's chilling.""

Families do sometimes prey on older relatives, taking their bank cards or selling their property, advocates for seniors say. But nursing home lawsuits in Rochester contain almost no documentation to support these claims.

Monroe County provided supporting records in only three of the 29 lawsuits it filed that included a fraudulent conveyance claim against a friend or relative of a resident. And Underberg & Kessler, a Rochester law firm that has represented the county and other nursing homes, attached documentation in only five of the 70 actions it filed with such claims. The firm has filed the most nursing home debt cases in Monroe County.

Anna Lynch, a partner, said the firm always has ""factual and legal grounds"" to file. ""The fact that the complaint does not make reference to the specific evidence does not mean there is not evidence,"" she said. ""When we do institute legal action on behalf of a nursing home, the firm reviews the agreements between the parties and the facts to make sure there are grounds for claims against the persons who are legally responsible for payment.""

Barbara Robinson, an 81-year-old widow who lives alone outside Rochester, said that wasn't her experience. She was sued by Monroe County three years ago for $21,000.

Robinson, who lives on a fixed income, signed papers for an older friend who was admitted to the county home, and she said she helped staff gather information to enroll her friend in Medicaid.

""As far as I knew, that was that,"" Robinson recalled. After the friend died, however, the county accused Robinson of taking her friend's assets. The county provided no documentation.

Robinson said there was no money to take, noting that her friend ""had spent every single dime."" A court ultimately dismissed the case, first reported by WHEC-TV in Rochester. Judge Debra Martin admonished the county for the lack of evidence. ""Plaintiff must allege some facts to support its claims,"" she wrote, noting that the county's case ""does not meet the bare minimum requirements.""

Ferris, who was sued over his estranged mother's debts, had his case dropped by the nursing home. Valerie King Hoak, a spokesperson for the Kirkhaven nursing home, said the facility ""cannot discuss private resident information or potential litigation with third parties.""

Brooks is now in the clear, too, after the county dropped its case against her. She said she thinks the signature on the admissions agreement was forged from the nursing home's visitor log, the only thing she signed.

The experience left her shaken. She now tells anyone with a friend or relative in a nursing home not to sign anything. ""It's ridiculous,"" she said. ""But why would you ever think they would be coming after you?""

"""Girls Who Code"" text books banned in a Pennsylvania school district",https://www.theregister.com/2022/09/26/girls_who_code_books_barred/,nottheonion,"Updated Books aimed at encouraging tween girls to code were removed or blocked from at least some classrooms in Pennsylvania's Central York School District, according to a free-speech campaign group.

The ""banned"" books, we're told, were the first four in the Girls Who Code series: The Friendship Code; Team BFF: Race to the Finish!; Girls Who Code, Lights, Music, Code!; and Spotlight on Coding Club!

The four tomes come from nonprofit organization Girls Who Code, which says it strives to close the technology industry's gender gap and change the image of ""what a programmer looks like and does."" The group works toward its goal with its books, summer camps, immersion programs, after school coding clubs, and more.

The Girls Who Code series is a mashup of The Babysitters Club and Computer Science 101. A group of four or five, depending which book in the series you are on, diverse tween girls navigate friendship, life, coding, and hackathons while the authors drop code fragments into the story line.

It's the type of stuff parents buy their kids in hopes of making IT seem cool.

But apparently not everyone found it aspirational. The four books ended up on freedom-of-expression advocacy group PEN America's Index of School Book Bans, which claimed the series was ""banned in the classroom"" sometime between July 1, 2021 and June 20, 2022.

Girls Who Code's founder Reshma Saujani pinned the ban on a group called ""Moms for Liberty,"" which advocates for parental rights in schools and oversight of educational material.

Saujani detailed her reaction to finding the books on the PEN America list:

To be honest, I am so angry I cannot breathe. This series was our labor of love, our commitment to our community to make sure that girls – all girls – see themselves as coders. You cannot be what you cannot see, and this was our effort to get more girls, girls of color interested in coding. And it worked!!

The founder later tweeted: ""Maybe they don't want girls to learn to code because that's a way to be economically secure."" Saujani also vowed to fight back against the alleged ban through her other nonprofit, Marshall Plan for Moms.

The Register reached out to Girls Who Code, Moms for Liberty, and Pennsylvania's Central York School District to better understand the situation, and we did not receive a response in time for publication.

Online book reviews suggest the Girls Who Code books are innocuous. One review read:

My daughter is six and loved this book. She has been reticent to listen to or read chapter books lately, and she had me read this to her twice in one day. I liked there was conflict resolution, positive role models, and it felt grown-up enough to make her feel like she was peering into 6th grade. There were two examples when the character used the word 'suck' or 'stupid' but otherwise it was pretty tame.

Moms for Liberty (MFL) lists many instances of its members being quoted in conservative media, all of them featuring comment critical of topics such as sex education, inclusive gender language, and advanced college-level critical race theory modules.

As for banning books, MFL cofounder Tina Descovich told Fox News the group is only concerned with children's access to pornography and sexually explicit material in the school environment.

""I haven't seen any of our chapters that want to get rid of any books that help children find characters they identify with,"" said Descovich. She conceded ""there are a lot of books in gray areas.""

The Register was unable to find any signs of pornographic or sexually explicit material within reviews or summaries describing the Girls Who Code books.

Pennsylvania's Central York School District is reportedly in a critical political swing region where Girls Who Code has an active club.

One tweeter said their daughter had quite enjoyed the Girls Who Code summer coding program, though the netizen was unhappy with content the organization included in its mailing list, which in the past touched on abortion and the rights of transgender people.

""I love the missions to get girls interested in programming. I just do not appreciate it with a side of politics,"" said the mom. ®

Updated to add

After this article went viral, Moms for Liberty got back to us. It denied it was behind any effort to ban the kids' programming books, and said the tales are today available from the district's school libraries. We note PEN specifically said ""classrooms"" not ""libraries,"" though, and that MFL acknowledged it seeks to ""curate"" materials children have access to, a softer word than ""ban.""

""The allegations that Moms for Liberty has worked to ban Girls Who Code are completely false,"" MFL cofounders Tina Descovich and Tiffany Justice told us in a statement. ""Furthermore, the Central York school district has confirmed the book is currently sitting on library shelves.

""Moms for Liberty will continue to fight for fundamental parental rights because curating age-appropriate content for a school library is not banning books, it is empowering parents to be involved in their children's education.""

What appears to have happened is that the Girls Who Code series appeared on a list of books and other materials drawn up by the Central York School District that teachers were allowed to use in the classroom. This list was called the Diversity Resource List as it focused on titles written by or about people of color; indeed, the Girls Who Code series features protagonists who are young girls of color.

When there was some outcry over this list – ostensibly regarding the content of the materials – the district board told teachers to hold off using the catalog until it had been vetted. That was interpreted by freedom-of-expression and pro-diversity campaigners as a ban. Then in September last year, about a year after the list was withheld and amid criticism and community anger, the school district finally approved the list. Thus Girls Who Code is today allowed in classrooms.

One point of contention is that Girls Who Code reportedly appeared on a list of approved teaching materials drawn up prior to the Diversity Resource List, and when the latter was frozen, the earlier list was allowed to stand. Thus Girls Who Code would have been allowed in classes. However, it was also on the withheld Diversity Resource List, as an example of diverse literature, so this may have been seen as a ban.

PEN America insisted the books were at one point verboten, and confirmed the titles were reinstated in September 2021.

""These books were banned in Central York in 2021,"" the group told us in a statement. ""Our understanding is that they were restored last fall, including the Girls Who Code series, after significant community outcry.

Removing books while they are under review is a ban

""PEN America's most recent report includes a list of all books that were banned during the 2021-22 school year, from July 2021-June 2022, including books that were banned for a limited or indefinite period of time. It is a record of all of the bans that were enacted over the course of the school year, many of which did cover books that are surprising targets, like the Girls Who Code series.

""Every book ban enacted, even if temporary, is a violation of students' freedom to read. 'Temporary' bans often become permanent, and the status of a book's availability to students, particularly in the absence of a neutral, established review process, is frequently opaque. Removing books while they are under review is a ban, is contrary to the best practice guidance established by the American Library Association and National Coalition Against Censorship, and because book removals preclude access, they are bans.

""Every ban limits students' access to those books, and can have a broader chilling effect. Tracking all bans is essential to understand the scope of restrictions being enacted on books across the country. Please see PEN America's definition of a book ban for further information."""
‘We're embarrassed’: Polk County sheriff volunteer arrested for selling drugs out of patrol vehicle,https://www.fox13news.com/news/polk-county-sheriffs-office-volunteer-arrested-for-drug-trafficking-weapons,nottheonion,"Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd says he is ""hotter than a bare butt on a tin roof in August"" after learning a sheriff’s volunteer officer was caught selling prescription pills out of a patrol car while in uniform.

Deputies arrested David Roberts, 69, on Thursday on weapons and drug trafficking charges.

An investigation into Roberts' activities began after detectives learned that a volunteer was selling Oxycodone and that the prescription pills had been found inside a patrol car.

After investigators learned Roberts was getting 90 Oxydone pills a month for the past two years and selling them for $10 apiece, an undercover deputy offered him $12 a pill.

Roberts agreed to meet the undercover deputy at a Lake Wales gas station and directed them to his patrol car for the transaction. Sheriff Judd says Roberts sat in the car, in uniform, as he counted the undercover deputy’s money and then handed over a baggie with the pills.

""That makes me so crazy I want to pluck my eyeballs out one at a time,"" Judd stated.

According to PCSO, the deputy followed Roberts back to the sheriff's substation where he was arrested. Judd says Roberts permitted deputies to search his home and that’s where they found marijuana. Roberts told deputies that the marijuana belonged to his nephew and he was just holding it for him.

Detectives also found a rifle and a pistol in Roberts’ home, which Judd says wouldn’t normally be a problem, but it was an issue because deputies learned Roberts was a convicted felon who was not allowed to possess weapons.

""You’re talking about an epic system failure,"" Judd said. ""He’s a convicted felon from 52 years ago.""

Judd says Roberts was arrested for a burglary when he was 19 years old.

""He said, ‘I can’t be a convicted felon, I’ve been voting all the way to Nixon,’"" Judd added.

Judd said Robert’s, who has been a volunteer for 12 years, slipped through the cracks. He added while volunteers don’t go through the same human resources detail and polygraph tests that full-time employees go through, he should have had a background check done.

""We’re embarrassed… Somebody messed up 12 years ago on a background,"" Judd stated. ""He’s been a stellar volunteer, very well-loved, done a good job, except when he’s selling oxys out of the car, using it as cover. I am livid.""

PCSO has more than 3,000 volunteers and Judd says the agency will audit its volunteer system. He added that a check of the rest of the volunteer sheriff’s officers did not find anything.

""Mr. David Roberts should recognize that selling 90 Oxycodones is a 15-year minimum mandatory and we’re going to help him get every day of that in prison. He admitted, ‘Welp, I embarrassed the agency’. That’s the understatement of the day.""

Judd noted that if Roberts is convicted he will serve his time in prison, not county jail, because of the felony weapons charges.

Judd said, ""He’s given me pain too, but I’m not going to get any oxy’s for it."""
"San Francisco’s $20,000 designer trash can struggles to contain trash",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/22/san-francisco-cost-trash-can-struggle,nottheonion,"San Francisco may struggle with an intractable housing crisis, gaping income inequality and a deserted downtown – but one thing it will not tolerate is second-rate trash cans.

In 2018, the city’s department of public works began the process of replacing its more than 3,000 existing public trash cans. Not content with the models already on the market, San Francisco launched what is now a three-and-half-year (and counting), $550,000 project to design bespoke bins for its streets.

The design criteria for the trash cans stressed innovation (“Each can must be outfitted with an electronic sensor that sends alerts when nearing trash capacity so it can be emptied before overflowing”), aesthetics (“The design must be a visual asset on the sidewalk”), and above all, rummage-resistance.

The existing bins were “easy targets of scavengers, who rummage through them and leave behind a mess”, according to the public works department.

In July, the city finally rolled out custom-made prototypes of the three finalist designs. Production of the prototypes cost between $11,000 and $20,900.

But having already spent three and a half years on this rubbish issue, the city isn’t going to make any rash decisions on the final design: everyone’s invited to weigh in on which can is best. The three prototypes are distributed all over the city, with QR codes attached so that citizens can provide feedback during a 60-day pilot program. (Also planted across the city are three “off-the-shelf” models, which would reportedly cost $630 to $2,800 each; the custom ones, when produced at scale, are expected to cost $2,000 to $3,000.)

The Guardian took a tour around the city to investigate the options.

Salt and Pepper

This $11,000 trash can lives up to its name: it looks like a salt or pepper shaker. The public works department says its “unique and elegant profile stands out from afar”, and indeed, it was visible from across the street. But it doesn’t look particularly unique or elegant when stuffed with garbage: it looks like a trash can. And though its design may limit graffiti as intended, the steel fins seem likely to prove difficult to clean; they were encrusted with some unidentifiable gunk.

The Salt and Pepper has a separate section on top that’s intended for recyclables, as indicated by an unintelligible symbol. It was packed with non-recyclable items, which seems inevitable when hurried passersby are faced with a stuffed bin.

The opening for normal trash was small, which the city says makes it “difficult to rummage in the can”. It also makes it difficult to throw out a cup of coffee. A wide lip at the bottom of the opening means you really have to reach in there to ensure your trash lands in the bin, rather than next to it. Seeking a trash can people can’t take things out of, San Francisco has built one you can’t put things into.

Slim Silhouette

For $18,800, you get a trash can with a circular mouth that makes it appear permanently alarmed.

This bin’s appearance is unobjectionable; despite its name, it has an appealing heft to it. It would look at home on any street, but so do the current green trash cans. And like its slightly cheaper sibling, it’s a lot more appealing in the prototype images than it is when scuffed up and nearly overflowing. Also like its sibling, it was not drawing any interest from passersby despite the QR code on its side.

The Slim Silhouette also has separate compartments for garbage and recycling; again, both were filled with trash. The trash hole was even smaller than the Salt and Pepper’s, and when a finicky Guardian reporter threw out an item, he was forced to touch other trash making a bid for escape.

Soft Square

And finally, the bin behind the headlines: the $20,900 Soft Square, which is neither soft nor a square. The city describes this one as having a “recognizable trash can silhouette”, which does seem like something you want in a trash can. No one wants San Franciscans dropping their mail in these things or mistaking them for long-lost friends.

This is the only trash can that requires users to open it. There’s a pedal at the bottom so you don’t have to touch the handle; unfortunately, the pedal is so sleek and subtle that the Guardian reporter didn’t initially notice it and pulled the bin open by hand. Short on trash, the reporter placed a nearby leaf into the receptacle. Reopening it revealed that both the leaf and another piece of trash, placed earlier by someone else, remained stuck in the deposit slot, from which a fly lazily emerged.

As if to prove the slot was too small, a bag of trash sat on the ground next to the Soft Square, creating the very mess the cans are intended to eliminate.

In a city obsessed with disruption, none of the models revolutionized the world of waste disposal. Might as well just go with the cheapest – or keep what we’ve got."
Conservatives in Idaho target 400 library books — but the library doesn't even own them,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/conservative-activists-want-ban-400-books-library-arent-even-shelves-rcna44026,nottheonion,"For months, a group of conservative Christians have inundated the staff and board of a public library in Bonners Ferry, Idaho, with complaints about books they didn’t want to see on the shelves.

Their list of more than 400 titles predominantly focuses on young adult books with LGBTQ characters, scenes describing sexual activity or invoking the occult.

The only problem: None of the books are in the library’s collection.

Still, the activists in this town of 2,500 people wanted the books pre-emptively banned. They fumed that the library planned to join the American Library Association, a nonprofit trade organization known for fighting censorship that local activists falsely accused of “promoting pedophilia.” They started a campaign to recall four of the five library trustees over a policy against restricting access to controversial books, putting up signs around town that read: “Our Mission is to protect children from explicit materials and grooming.”

The fervor has become so heated that the library’s director is quitting after just nine months, citing a barrage of harassment that she said made it impossible to do her job. Kimber Glidden, 51, a former bank manager turned librarian, said the stress became so bad that she developed a tic that makes her thumb quiver uncontrollably.

In Glidden’s Aug. 16 resignation announcement on Facebook, she stated that “nothing in my background could have prepared me for the political atmosphere of extremism, militant Christian fundamentalism, intimidation tactics, and threatening behavior currently being employed in the community.”

“They don’t know what comes next. They just want to burn it down, and they’re doing a good job,” Glidden told NBC News.

Donna Capurso and Adrienne Norris, two of the trustees’ recall organizers, did not respond to requests for comment.

“We want a strongly written policy that will not allow the library to order materials with sex acts,” the group stated on Facebook this month, adding that the American Library Association “has brainwashed our libraries” into believing this is a First Amendment issue.

The fight in Bonners Ferry over what books are allowed in the Boundary County Public Library echoes battles playing out at libraries across the country. Conflicts over literature that discuss sexuality and contain explicit passages have bled from school board meetings into library board meetings, as conservative and far-right activists call for bans on books, Pride Month displays and membership to the American Library Association.

In August, a librarian in Louisiana was nearly fired after she spoke out against censorship. Local officials in a Texas town suggested that the public library could be evicted if it didn’t reconsider complaints about LGBTQ-themed books in its collection. And a group of conservative residents in a Michigan town successfully campaigned to deny funding to the local library after its board said it would not ban books, an effort that far-right activists on Facebook and Telegram have held up as inspiration.

According to the American Library Association, attempts to censor materials in libraries and schools nationwide increased last year to 729 — more than double the typical amount of book challenges in previous years, targeting 1,597 books. More than a third of the censorship attempts in 2021 occurred at public libraries, prompting some libraries to ban Black History Month and Pride displays, while others closed due to harassment of LGBTQ employees.

“It’s wrong when one parent can dictate what information is available to an entire community, which may have the effect of denying the diversity and the variety of identities that are already living in that community,” said Deborah Caldwell-Stone, who oversees the association’s Office of Intellectual Freedom.

‘Under God’s standards’

In Bonners Ferry, where about 78% of voters supported former President Donald Trump in 2020, the library has been a jewel in the community. The Library Journal, a trade publication, named it the Best Small Library in America in 2017, celebrating its 3D printer, laser engraver and milling machine, as well as computer and smartphone tutoring for the elderly, and free virtual classes with NASA scientists.

The conflict over controversial materials started in March, when a handful of locals approached library officials with a list of books from the right-wing website Growing Freedom for Idaho that they wanted to see removed from the shelves. Library officials responded that they did not have any of those books and didn’t plan to stock them anytime soon.

Lee Colson, one of the Boundary County library trustees, said he thought informing them that the library didn’t have the books would be the end of their complaints, but “then it seemed to morph.”

Activists fumed at board meetings after Glidden, the library’s director, said she would order some of the books if enough patrons requested them. They demanded that the board pass a policy promising not to order controversial books, or — if they did — to place them in an adults-only room so that children are not “accidentally exposed” while browsing the library stacks. They asked the library to judge books “under God’s standards and not of the world’s standards,” according to emails obtained through open records requests.

“What they are looking for us to do is say we will never get a book that offends them personally, which is pretty hard to define, and not really the point of the library,” Colson, the trustee, said.

Activists also cited a bill, HB 666, that had recently cleared the Idaho House, but died in the Senate. The bill would have removed an exemption in state law that protects employees of schools, museums, universities and libraries from prosecution for “disseminating material harmful to minors.” The exemption’s intent is to protect educators, curators and librarians from criminal charges over explicit or risqué art and literature that they consider to have merit.

Book ban supporters argued HB 666 was needed because the Boundary County library was “hiding” behind the exemption. But censorship opponents disagreed.

“They would rather that nobody have access to books rather than one or two people have access to gay content or content written by people of color,” said Jessica Tingley, who has organized demonstrations in support of the Boundary County library.

‘They’re spreading lies’

Glidden, who previously worked at a library in neighboring Sandpoint, Idaho, started in December as the Boundary County library director and reviewed its policies to ensure they were up to date.

In June, the board of trustees voted to update the rules for selecting materials, requiring a variety of viewpoints to be reflected in the titles on the shelves. The updated materials selection policy also vowed that the library will “not place materials on ‘closed shelves’ or label items to protect the public from their content.” It passed by a vote of 3-1, with one member absent.

Then the pressure ramped up.

Capurso, a real estate agent and activist, arranged a meeting in July to organize a recall of the library trustees, accusing board members of voting to expose children to “adult only” material “without listening to ‘We the People’ regarding their actions before their votes.”

“We need to avert this travesty being promulgated by the far left, not just here, but all over our nation,” Capurso, who calls herself a “patriot journalist” wrote on a blog affiliated with the American Redoubt, a far-right migration movement seeking to establish a safe haven in the Northwest for conservative Christians.

At least three times in the last three months, a woman has blown a shofar horn outside the library, according to Glidden and security footage obtained by NBC News. (Shofars, typically made from ram’s horns, are part of Jewish traditions, but Christians have increasingly used them as a message of spiritual warfare.)

Glidden said people have falsely accused her of “grooming children for pedophiles,” and her staff has started dining and shopping in neighboring counties to avoid conflicts. Critics of the library have called the censorship conflict a “spiritual battle for the hearts and minds of children,” on Facebook.

“They’re spreading lies, they’re destroying lives and they’re doing it with impunity,” Glidden said. “They’re putting on this cloak of religion, but I’m not sure what god they worship.”

Library trustee Kenneth Blockhan, who said he considers himself religious, said he has concerns about the amount of discussion of LGBTQ issues in public school curricula. But he said he is disturbed by the call to ban books from the public library and believes it’s part of a larger movement to impose puritan standards on the community.

“The library is not a day care,” he said. “If you’re a parent, you are the responsible party for checking out books that your children need to read. It’s not the library’s responsibility. It is the parent’s responsibility to make sure that their children are not getting a hold of the bad stuff or whatever to sit there and read.”

At the library’s Aug. 18 board meeting, two days after Glidden announced resignation plans, multiple people reiterated their complaints about how Glidden and the trustees have dealt with book ban requests. Several people cited Bible verses and warned board members and Glidden that they’re bringing a curse on themselves.

Glidden said she plans to stay on until Sept. 10. She said she and her family are still plotting where they will go next, but she vowed it would not be a red state.

“This is a publicly funded library,” Glidden said. “That means what they’re ultimately going to demand that I do is actually end up being in violation of the Constitution,” she said, referring to the First Amendment’s protection of free speech. “I’d rather be someone accused of having naughty books than be in violation of the Constitution.”"
University investigates PhD student’s paper on masturbating to comics of ‘young boys’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/11/manchester-university-phd-masturbating-to-comics-of-young-boys,nottheonion,"A leading university has launched an inquiry after it emerged that one of its PhD students has written a research paper about sexual attraction to young boys.

Karl Andersson spent three months recording his thoughts and feelings while masturbating over images of young boys in Japanese comic books.

In the abstract for the paper, Andersson, who is interviewing fans of shota comics for his PhD, said he wanted to “understand how [they] experience sexual pleasure when reading shota”.

His 4,000-word study, which details his sexual habits and sexual encounters between boys in the comics, was published in the journal Qualitative Research in April. It provoked outrage from academics, an MP and others after it was circulated on Twitter this week.

The University of Manchester and Qualitative Research have announced they are investigating the circumstances of the research and its publication.

In the paper, Andersson explains how he will document the details of each masturbation session in a journal as “a kind of critical self-reflection”. He describes how he gave up all other sexual activity, from sex with other people to other types of pornography.

“I happened to live alone during this experiment, and I had newly become single after a long relationship – these factors probably contributed to my willingness and eagerness to explore this method,” he wrote.

Dr Mara Keire, a historian at Oxford University who writes about sexual violence, expressed her shock at the research paper, tweeting: “How was a description of the author masturbating to the images of young boys peer reviewed and published?”

The Conservative MP Neil O’Brien asked: “Why should hard-working taxpayers in my constituency have to pay for an academic to write about his experiences masturbating to Japanese porn?”

An National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children spokesperson said: “That this research was published in a peer-reviewed journal is highly concerning, and it’s right that the universities and publishers involved are investigating. All research, and research publication, should be subject to proportionate but rigorous ethical review, including robust safeguarding checks.”

Andersson’s University of Manchester profile page states that his PhD research is funded by the school of arts, languages and cultures. But in his research paper he declares that he “received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article”.

A University of Manchester spokesperson said: “The recent publication in Qualitative Research of the work of a student, now registered for a PhD, has raised significant concerns and complaints which we are taking very seriously. We are currently undertaking a detailed investigation into all aspects of their work, the processes around it and other questions raised. It is very important that we look at the issues in-depth.”

In a statement published online, the editors of Qualitative Research said they had begun an investigation into the publication of Andersson’s research, which would address whether it met ethical standards.

“On August 9th we began investigating the publication of the paper ‘I am not alone – we are all alone: Using masturbation as an ethnographic method in research on shota subculture in Japan,’ published earlier this year,” said the statement.

“We are continuing with our investigations and will consider closely all guidance from the Committee of Publication Ethics and ensure that any actions taken comply with COPE standards.”

Andersson has been contacted for comment.

Twitter hasn’t paid rent for weeks and is considering withholding severance payments,http://techaint.com/2022/12/14/twitter-hasnt-paid-rent-for-weeks-and-is-considering-withholding-severance-payments/,nottheonion,"US billionaire Elon Musk is doing everything he can to cut costs on Twitter. The company has reportedly stopped paying rent for weeks.

To cut costs, Twitter hasn’t paid rent for its San Francisco headquarters and offices around the world for weeks. The New York Times reports, citing three anonymous people close to the company. In addition, there were internal discussions about the consequences if the thousands of employees who were laid off were not paid the severance payments due. In addition, the auction of furniture, electronics, and kitchen appliances from the Twitter headquarters is scheduled for mid-January. At the end of November, the US newspaper reported that the new Twitter boss Elon Musk was refusing to pay for business trips that were approved before his takeover.

Cutting costs on Twitter by any means necessary

The report suggests that the chaos at Twitter continues as Musk seeks various avenues to cut costs and increase revenue. The reintroduced subscription service Twitter Blue should also help. For eight or eleven US dollars a month there is, among other things, the blue tick next to the profile name. But Musk has also promised that you will see 50 percent less advertising and that is becoming a problem, writes the online portal Platformer. Because Twitter would cost six US dollars per account, they are said to be planning that all users must agree to the display of personalized advertising in order to remain on the platform. This should not only lead to a new conflict with Apple.

The New York Times, meanwhile, continues to write that Musk is still laying off staff, including high-level managers. Only at the weekend did the new company management give the remaining employees another ultimatum, this time it was about the confidentiality obligation, Platformer had made public. Anyone who did not confirm by Saturday that he or she understood the obligations involved was locked out of the internal systems. That hit over 100 employees who didn’t check their email inboxes over the weekend. In addition, Twitter allegedly currently has no administrator access to its own GitHub account, but dismissed employees do.

NEW: Twitter currently does not have admin access to some of its GitHub repos. These repos contain Twitter source code (much of it is open source; some is not). This includes code for companies Twitter acquired, like Smyte. 1/ — Zoë Schiffer (@ZoeSchiffer) December 13, 2022

The New York Times goes on to say that Musk, along with several lawyers, brought additional SpaceX staff to Twitter. Just on Monday, Twitter previously dissolved the Trust & Safety Council, which was supposed to provide an external perspective on dealing with hate, child abuse, and self-harm, among other things. The resolution came via email shortly before a meeting of the panel scheduled for Monday. Elon Musk also defamed Twitter’s former Trust and Safety executive. He then apparently feared for his safety and fled his apartment. Musk then also shared a slogan from the conspiracy theory and terrorist movement QAnon.

Los Angeles voters to decide if hotels will be forced to house the homeless despite safety concerns,https://www.foxnews.com/media/los-angeles-voters-decide-hotels-forced-house-homeless-safety-concerns,nottheonion,"Los Angeles voters will cast their ballot on a proposal that could force hotels to house the homeless, a policy that has many hotel owners concerned about how it will impact public safety.

President of the Northeast Los Angeles Hotel Owners Association Ray Patel joined ""Fox & Friends Weekend,"" Sunday, to discuss why the policy is not a long-term solution and his worry if the policy is adopted.

""This is not a solution, it's just a temporary fix,"" Patel told co-host Carley Shimkus. ""And during Project Roomkey, a great example, they housed the unhoused in the hotels – but the government never provided an end solution. They never provided transitional services to permanent housing; and simply issuing hotel vouchers impacting our hotels and our marketability of those rooms to the pain tourist, corporate travelers and locals is not a solution now.""

LOS ANGELES CITY COUNCIL APPROVES MEASURE TO BAN HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS NEAR SCHOOLS

Patel touted the COVID-era program to secure housing for the homeless, but stressed his concern surrounding how the policy would impact public safety as crime continues to spiral out of control.

If passed, the voucher program would require hotels to send information on their vacant rooms for the day by 2 PM daily, but Patel stressed that many guests have not yet checked in by that time.

""That just doesn't make sense because at 2 PM people are barely checking into the hotels, and they're asking us to combine both populations in a hotel - the paying guests and those that have hotel vouchers that would be issued by the city,"" Patel said.

""And our great concern is the safety of our guests, our staff and also our neighbors that surround the business communities,"" he continued.

The homeless crisis has been a long-time issue in Los Angeles, but has worsened in many cities nationwide since the pandemic began.

According to the L.A. Homeless Services Authority, over 66,000 people were homeless in 2020, which was a 12% increase from 2019."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Alexei Druzhinin/AP Alexei Druzhinin/AP

A Russian-owned superyacht can't leave a dock in Norway — not because of sanctions, but because no one in the port will sell it fuel. The Ragnar is owned by Russian oligarch Vladimir Strzhalkovsky, a former KGB agent who has long been linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""We find the discrimination against us, extremely unjust,"" the yacht's captain, Robert Lankester, wrote in a message decrying the ship's predicament. He noted that Strzhalkovsky is not currently on a European or U.K. sanctions list. And, he said, the yacht's crew is not Russian.

Lankester's public notice was highlighted by Norwegian public broadcaster NRK, which reports that the Malta-registered ship is sitting at a quay in Narvik, a port city in northern Norway.

Strzhalkovsky is the former head of mining giant Norilsk Nickel. The 68-meter (223 feet) Ragnar was custom-built on the hull of a former service ship capable of pushing its way through ice. Part of its bespoke interior evokes a cozy British pub, according to a profile in Boat International. And while its amenities include ""a BigBo amphibious ATV, heli-skiing equipment, four See-Doos, four ski scooters, six Seabobs, a multipurpose island and a giant slide,"" it currently can't find anyone who will fill its fuel tanks.

Let them row home, a local supplier told NRK. He and others say they want to support Ukraine.

The Ragnar, which was listed for sale a year ago, offers charter trips for winter getaways. But its captain says a recent trip fell through, and he now wants to bring the ship back to its home port in Malta.

Strzhalkovsky made U.S. headlines in 2017, when members of Congress pressed then-Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross about his business connections to Russia and his former role as vice chairman of the Bank of Cyprus — a post that, for a time, he shared with Strzhalkovsky.

When Strzhalkovsky left Norilsk Nickel in 2012, he did so with a $100 million golden parachute.

Child marriage is still legal in Michigan as fight continues to change the law,https://www.wxyz.com/news/child-marriage-is-still-legal-in-michigan-as-fight-continues-to-change-the-law,nottheonion,"(WXYZ) — The age minimum for getting married in Michigan may shock you. Technically it is age zero. There is no minimum under the law.

A group of women who say marrying while they were underage hurt their lives are working to change that. They say it is about health, wealth and even national security. They felt devastated when Michigan’s legislature refused to move a bill forward making sure only adults get married.

As the year ends, survivors of child marriage are speaking out — saying Michigan lawmakers failed them. They allowed a 125-year-old law that allows parents to come to court and get permission to marry off their young children to stay on the books.

""We’re giving get out of jail free cards to child rapists,"" that's the message child marriage survivor Fraidy Reese shared with the Senate Judicial Committee as it considered raising the age you can get married in Michigan to 18.

Reese founded the national organization Unchained At Last. She says more than 5,400 children — under 18 — have married in Michigan since 2000.

""The youngest person in the last 20 years to marry in this state was a 14-year-old child. Under our state laws, when that marriage was consummated, that was then statutory rape,"" said Courtney Kosnik.

Kosnik — who also testified in Lansing — sat down with 7 Action News to share what it was like to learn that the bill that would ban child marriage would not be taken up for a vote before the full State Senate this year.

""I sat in my office and cried for a few minutes,"" said Kosnik.

Kosnik got married at 17 years old. A minister her husband met at AA meetings officiated. She says people should know that a judge can sign off on a marriage for any age child in Michigan — and a parent can sign off on a marriage for a 16 or 17 year old.

Courtney says the whole process sends the message that what children want doesn’t really matter. After all, her mom and future husband at the time came to court and filed for a marriage license without her.

""My name is not on my own marriage license. It is my mom’s name. She gave permission and married me off,"" said Kosnik.

Her 28-year-old husband, she says, soon became abusive. After one beating — she went to a women’s shelter.

""If you are under 18, a women’s shelter will not take you in. They tell you you need to go to a juvenile detention center ... detention center? What did I do wrong?"" said Kosnik.

She called lawyers to ask for help getting a divorce and was told she was too young to sign a retainer.

""And they were like, 'well, how old are you? We can’t talk to you' ... It was just one door after another to where I knew I had no way out. I was stuck,"" she said.

She soon became a mom in a controlling marriage. When she finally divorced, she said he stalked her until a felony stalking warrant was issued.

""He was a predator,"" said Kosnik.

Sasha Taylor says her family forced her to marry a man seven years older than her in Arizona after his family made financial promises.

""My mother was married when she was 15, my grandmother was married in a refugee camp when she was 8 years old, and here is my mother in an abusive situation. So for her, it's to get me out of that household, to get the children out of an abusive household,"" said Taylor.

Taylor says she was used as a child bride to help him immigrate — and that is happening to many girls in Michigan.

""I was used for a visa bride,"" said Taylor.

State Senator Michael MacDonald — a republican from Macomb County said he is not giving up.

""They say it's kind of the Wild West in Michigan; a lot of people don’t realize that these laws even still exist,"" said Sen. MacDonald.

He has bi-partisan support and hopes a new bill will move in 2023.

""Your entire childhood is taken away from you, and that is not how it should be,"" said Taylor.

Kosnik said, ""I am frustrated. This isn’t partisan. Who are we protecting? Predators? People who prey on young children? Pedophiles?""

World’s first Tamil Bible stolen from Thanjavur traced to London museum,https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2022/jul/01/worlds-first-tamil-biblestolen-from-thanjavurtraced-to-london-museum-2471836.html,nottheonion,"Sahaya Novinston Lobo By

Express News Service

CHENNAI: The world’s first-ever Tamil Bible printed around 300 years ago has been traced to a museum in London. The state Idol Wing is in the process of bringing the Bible back to India.to restore the stolen manuscript back. The Bible was stolen in 2005 from Thanjavur.

The antiquarian Bible is suspected to have been stolen by a group of foreigners who visited the Saraswathi Mahal Library 17 years ago.

The Bible was printed by the first Protestant missionary to India, Bartholomaeus Ziegenbalg between 1715-1718 after he set up a printing press in the Thanjavur district. The manuscript was gifted to Tulaji Rajah Serfoji, the then ruler of the Thanjavur Bhonsle dynasty.

On October 10, 2005, the Deputy Administrator of the Serfoji Palace in Thanjavur district, filed a complaint with the Thanjavur West Police station stating the theft of the antique Bible. Then the police registered only a CSR and closed the case. However, in October 17, 2017, E Rajendran, the office bearer of the Saraswathi Mahal Library lodged a complaint to the Idol Wing CID about the disappearance of the antiquarian Bible. A case was registered under section 380 of IPC (theft in dwelling house) and investigation was initiated.

Since there was no headway in the investigation, a special review was sought from former police officers. Based on new directions by Director General of Police, Idol Wing, K Jayanth Murali and other senior police officers, a special team was formed under Inspector of Police, Indira to trace the missing Bible two years ago.

“Quick examination of the visitor’s register at the Saraswathi Mahal Library in Thanjavur revealed that the place hosted few foreigners on October 7, 2005, days before the manuscript went missing. After further enquiries we found that visitors had come to India to attend a function to commemorate Bartholomaeus Ziegenbalg, the Danish missionary who printed the Tamil Bible,” said Jayanth Murali.

The Idol Wing launched a search of the websites of various museums in the world, as also Collector's websites and organisations connected with Bartholomaeus Ziegenbalg.

Police sources said that after several days of browsing multiple websites of various museums around the world and specifically European countries, the Idol Wing stumbled on the collection of George III which included thousands of printed books, manuscripts and pamphlets, most of which are rare. Hidden amongst the thousands of books, the officers discovered the stolen Bible, the first translated antiquarian Bible in Tamil that was printed in a printing press at Tharangambadi in the 18th century with the signature of Rajah Serfogi of Tanjore himself. The antiquarian Bible that was available on the website of the Kings collection tallied with the picture of the stolen Bible.

History:

Bartholomaeus Ziegenbalg, the missionary to South India, was born in Saxony in 1682. He studied at the University of Balle, the then centre for the Pietistic movement in the Lutheran Church. He responded to an appeal from the King of Denmark for missionaries. In September 1706, he and Heinrich Plueshau arrived in Tranquebar (anglicised form of Tharangambadi in the Tamil), a tiny Danish colony on the east coast, close to Nagapattinam in Tamil Nadu, on the southeast coast of India, as the first Protestant missionaries in the country.

He soon set up a printing press and published studies of the Tamil language and Indian religion and culture. His translation of the New Testament into Tamil in 1715 and the church building he and his associates constructed in 1718 are still in use today. He died on 23 February 1719 at age 37, He left a Tamil translation of the New Testament and Old Testament (from Genesis through Ruth), many brief writings in Tamil, two church buildings, the seminary, and 250 baptised Christians.

Another missionary named Schwartz who followed Bartholomaeus, became a close friend and advisor of Tulaji Rajah Serfoji, the then ruler. In commemoration of their friendship, Schwartz is suspected to have handed over the first copy of the new testament, which Ziegenbalg printed, to Tulaji Rajah Serfogi. Post-independence, after the takeover by the government of Tamilnadu, the antiquarian book became an exhibit in the Saraswati Mahal Museum for public viewing.

Tamil Nadu Idol Wing, Director General of Police, Jayanth Murali, said, ""We have initiated steps to restore the Bible to the library. The copy of the Bible given by a Danish missionary to the then Tanjore King Serfoji is a rare manuscript of Maharaja. Its value gets further enhanced by the fact that the cover of this book bears the signature of the then King of Tanjore Serfoji,""

The Idol wing is in process to retrieve the Bible and restore it to the Saraswathi Mahal library under the UNESCO treaty at the earliest.

"Acting police chief named ""Crook"" stands in for former chief accused of being a crook.",https://mendovoice.com/2022/06/criminal-investigation-into-ukiah-police-chief-noble-waidelich-still-shrouded-in-secrecy-on-day-4-capt-cedric-crook-named-acting-chief/,nottheonion,"UKIAH, 6/16/22 — Four days into the criminal investigation of Ukiah Police Chief Noble Waidelich, the exact nature of the crimes alleged remains shrouded in secrecy. The Mendocino County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement Thursday that the current investigation is unrelated to the allegations of domestic violence for which Waidelich was investigated in 2015, but it remains unclear whether the police chief has been arrested or will be returning to the job.

“The alleged incident was a new allegation not connected to the previous allegation of domestic violence previously investigated by the Mendocino County Sheriff’s Office,” MCSO Capt. Gregory Van Patten said Thursday morning in an email. “The Mendocino County Sheriff’s Office will not comment as to the nature of the alleged misconduct or incident location to protect the integrity of the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office ongoing investigation.”

Capt. Cedric Crook has been named acting chief, according to City Manager Sage Sangiacomo.

Ukiah City Manager Sage Sangiacomo said Capt. Cedric Crook has been named acting chief, but very little else. A spokesman for the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office, which is handling the criminal investigation, said they were brought in Monday, June 13, at the request of Sheriff Kendall for the sake of transparency. Waidelich hasn’t appeared in the booking logs for the Mendocino County Jail as of the time of this writing, or the SCSO arrest logs.

“We understand this case will have increased public interest,” SCSO Sgt. Juan Valencia said in an email Wednesday. “The Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office cannot release additional information due to the active status of this investigation and to protect the integrity of this case.”

Valencia said the case would be referred to Mendocino County District Attorney David Eyster upon completion of SCSO’s investigation. As of Thursday afternoon, no new civil or criminal cases naming Waidelich as a defendant have appeared in the Mendocino County Superior Court’s online database. Eyster did not immediately return a call requesting comment late Thursday morning.

According to Section 3304 (c) of the California Peace Officer’s Bill of Rights: “No chief of police may be removed by a public agency, or appointing authority, without providing the chief of police with written notice and the reason or reasons therefore and an opportunity for administrative appeal.”

That, presumably, takes time. But it doesn’t explain the degree of secrecy with which this case is being handled by every agency involved. The city may be bound by contractual obligations, but those would not carry over to Eyster or SCSO.

Wednesday evening during a regularly scheduled meeting of the Ukiah City Council, councilmembers voted to add an “urgency item” to their closed session agenda regarding the discipline, dismissal or removal of an unidentified employee. They adjourned to closed session two hours and 15 minutes into the meeting — and that’s where the video ends. City staff did not respond to an email Thursday inquiring about reportable action out of closed session.

Not a single person brought up the mysterious allegations against Waidelich during public comment Wednesday evening, although a local pastor did thank the police chief for his assistance with abatement efforts at a homeless encampment in the vicinity of the Orr Street Bridge. It was not clear whether the speaker was aware of the criminal investigation resulting in Waidelich’s administrative leave."
CNN writer frets Americans care more about 'cost of French fries' than 'compelling' Jan. 6 committee,https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnn-writer-frets-americans-care-more-about-cost-french-fries-compelling-jan-6-committee,nottheonion,"A new CNN analysis fretted that American voters might care more about the cost of their food than they do about the Jan. 6 hearings.

Noting Thursday’s Consumer Price Index data which showed inflation reaching 8.2% in September, as well as a cost-of-living index at its highest level since 1982, CNN's Stephen Collinson noted polling has repeatedly reinforced that the economy is the top concern to voters heading into the midterm elections. The data included information about frozen potato products, as well as pork products, which have increased 10% and 5.5%, respectively.

""While it would be too simplistic to say voters are more preoccupied with the cost of French fries than the price of democratic freedoms, it wouldn’t be far from the mark,"" Collinson wrote.

REPUBLICANS HAMMER BIDEN FOR FAILED PREDICTION THAT INFLATION HAD PEAKED LAST DECEMBER

prev Image 3 of 3

A new CNN/SSRS poll from Thursday also showed that 59% of registered voters say that the economy is an ""extremely important"" factor in their vote, rising to 67% in competitive congressional districts. The poll also found that only 32% of respondents approve of the White House's handling of inflation. On the economy as a whole, only 36% approved of Biden’s performance.

It was determined back in July that the U.S. suffered back-to-back consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, which has long been the indicator of a recession. However, both the Biden administration and many members of the media have dismissed that long-standing definition.

But, Biden acknowledged in a recent CNN interview the possibility of what he described as a ""slight recession"" could occur in the near future.

Collinson acknowledged there's little evidence to suggest that the ""compelling"" evidence from the January 6 committee has dominated conversations outside of Washington, D.C., where the revelations about former President Trump's conduct around the Capitol riot have driven headlines and news cycles for months. He added it’s ""not surprising"" that the ""pernicious force"" of inflation is top of mind for voters with the midterms approaching.

ECONOMIC ISSUES FAR OUTPACE SOCIAL ISSUES AMONG VOTER CONCERNS AHEAD OF NOVEMBER MIDTERMS

""But the difficulty that democracy proponents have had in turning their fight into a defining political issue – at least in these midterm elections – underscores the findings of experts who have studied the rise of authoritarian societies abroad. Often, voters only realize that their democracy is dying is when it’s too late,"" Collinson added.

The House Jan. 6 committee held a hearing Thursday focusing on Trump's state of mind leading up to the January 2021 assault on the U.S. Capitol, despite not receiving testimony during the panel's 15-month tenure from the ex-commander-in-chief or top associates linked to efforts to overturn the 2020 election.

The committee is set to disband at the end of this Congress unless lawmakers vote to reauthorize it next year, an unlikely prospect if Republicans win back control of the House.

NASCAR driver stuns racing world with a move learned from Nintendo GameCube,https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/11/nascar-driver-stuns-racing-world-with-a-move-learned-from-nintendo-gamecube/,nottheonion,"On Sunday, NASCAR driver Ross Chastain made history with an unprecedented wall-riding maneuver that qualified him for a championship race and set the record for the fastest lap on the track at 18.845 seconds. Remarkably, Chastain said he learned the move playing NASCAR 2005 on the Nintendo GameCube when he was a kid.

The maneuver happened at the Xfinity 500 race hosted at Martinsville Speedway in Ridgeway, Virginia. Martinsville is a half-mile short track built in 1947 that is well known for its tight, shallow-banked turns that usually require heavy braking to negotiate.

During the final lap of the race, Chastain found himself in 10th place but needed to pick up two positions to earn enough points to qualify for the Championship race on November 6. Instead of slowing down on the turn, Chastain shifted into fifth gear and gunned it, riding the outside wall and passing five cars to finish the race in fifth place.

Ross Chastain hit the NOS button to make it to the championship over Denny @rubbinisracing pic.twitter.com/XyDBXyj5wD — Barstool Sports (@barstoolsports) October 30, 2022

In a post-race interview with NBC Sports, Chastain said, ""I played a lot of NASCAR 2005 on the GameCube with Chad [Chastain's brother] growing up, and you can get away with it, and I never knew if it would actually work. I did that when I was 8 years old.""

The game Chastain is referring to is likely NASCAR 2005: Chase For the Cup, released in September 2004 for GameCube. Chastain, born in December 1992, would have been 12 at the time. To check out the technique, we ran NASCAR 2005 in the Dolphin emulator on a PC, selected the Martinsville track where Chastain pulled off his move, and rode the wall. It is indeed possible in the game, although it takes a great deal of skill and a little luck to use the technique to pull ahead as Chastain did.

To understand the advantage of Chastain's move, a little knowledge of racing physics comes in handy. Typically, when taking a tight turn on a racetrack, drivers brake to counteract forces that push their cars toward the outside of the track. This braking action dramatically slows them down on the turn. This time, instead of slowing down for the turn, Chastain kept his car in fifth gear, hugged the wall, let go of the wheel, and allowed the wall to hold his car in place—no brakes necessary. That's how he passed five cars and set a 75-year lap record.

Of course, a move like that comes at a cost, which is probably why it hasn't been tried—at least not successfully—until now. Chastain faced guaranteed damage to the finish of his car from scraping the wall and potentially catastrophic failure if his car happened to hit a protruding obstruction. ""Once I got against the wall, I basically let go of the wheel and just hoped I didn't catch the turn four access gate or something crazy,"" Chastain said, ""But I was willing to do it.""

For now, the racing world is equal parts amazed, surprised, and even a little worried that Chastain's move might become a regular technique going forward. For now, Chastain likely appreciates the attention as he prepares for the Championship on November 6—thanks to the Nintendo GameCube."

"""Makes me feel loved"": Pennsylvania man's alligator becomes emotional support animal",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/wally-alligator-emotional-support-animal/,nottheonion,"If you saw an alligator walking down the street, swimming in your pool or crashing your wedding, you might try to run away. But alligator expert Joie Henney says his alligator, Wally, poses no threat.

Henney said Wally was found in a pond in Disney World. Since it's illegal in Florida to relocate alligators to another spot in the wild, Henney agreed to take him in. Today, Wally lives on Cheetos and chicken legs in Joie's house near Hershey, Pennsylvania — without a cage.

""I've never met an alligator that will not bite you,"" Henney told CBS News. ""You fool around [with their head], their instinct is to grab you. He does not do it. You can reach in there and rub his tongue. He refuses to close his mouth. We don't know why.""

Henney doesn't recommend finding an alligator of your own, as most won't be so sweet or cuddly. But he said his bond with Wally is ""very special.""

""He is my emotional support alligator,"" he added.

Henney said after losing some people close to him, he fell into a deep depression. Around the same time, Wally stepped up to the plate and became more affectionate — as if he sensed his owner's needs.

""I'd lay on the couch, and I'd wake up and he'd be laying on my head,"" Henney said. ""And I knew it was for a long period of time because I had his whole jaw print on my face.""

It also marked a new chapter in their relationship. Henney started bringing Wally everywhere, from the doctor's office to the drive-thru.

They've been to a splash park together, and Wally was even a ring bearer at a wedding. Due to their strong connection, Henney said his depression has dramatically improved.

""I'll get lonely and stuff like that and he seems to sense that stuff and he'll come up and he'll give me a hug,"" Henney said, adding that Wally ""makes me feel loved.""

"Shaking ceilings, raunchy songs: complaints of New Yorkers’ noisy sex are rising",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/28/new-yorkers-complaints-noisy-sex,nottheonion,"A wave of “sex mayhem” has apparently been sweeping New York City, prompting residents to lodge an increasing number of noise complaints to a government helpline.

New York is no stranger to noise complaints – New Yorkers file as many as 75,000 a month – but new 311 call data obtained by Patch has revealed that many recent complaints arise from those disturbed by their neighbors’ late-night ventures.

From 19 February 2021 to 9 February this year, the website reported, the official helpline received 277 complaints about noisy sex. Queens produced the most, with 103. Manhattan came second with 66 while Brooklyn produced 55, the Bronx 48 and Staten Island four.

In Cross Bay Boulevard, in Queens, 56 complaints were logged about “hippies” allegedly dressing up as Freddy Krueger, Pennywise and the Easter Bunny while engaging in coital revelry as the theme song of Velveteen Dream, a pro wrestler, blasted in the background.

“They’re still here causing a sex mayhem,” a neighbor complained one day at 6am. “Thought it was too cold outside for an orgy party. Doesn’t stop this guy.”

Another Queens resident said: “For the love of God, stop these sex addicts … O to the R to the G to the Y. If you know how to spell and read that is ‘orgy’.”

In Greenwood Heights, in Brooklyn, a resident said that they had slept through natural disasters but their neighbor’s activities were now keeping them up.

“To get a sense of how disruptive they are, I’ve slept through earthquakes and fires in my life … I couldn’t sleep through this,” the resident wrote last April, in a complaint lodged at 2.45am.

Someone else reported: “[She] makes the bed squeak as if it’s an Olympics event.”

Another said: “Ceiling shaking and debris falling sex.”

Complaints obtained by Patch also revealed that New Yorkers have been involuntarily privy to bedroom narrations aligned with current events.

On 23 December at 11pm, for one seasonal example, a resident in East Harlem, in Manhattan, said: “Some guy is singing jingle balls at the top of his voice … Another person is screaming [‘Y]es daddy come down my chimney.’”

Last spring, when the federal government distributed Covid-19 stimulus checks as part of the American Rescue Plan, one Bronx resident complained at 12:45am: “Loud banging and moaning. Heard the neighbor saying, ‘How’s this STIMMY baby!’”

In a statement to Patch, a New York police spokesperson, Sophia Mason, said the NYPD took all quality of life complaints seriously.

“[We] will continue to monitor and address all complaints,” she said."
Pregnant Texas woman who claimed her unborn baby counts as a passenger in HOV lane is ticketed again,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/pregnant-texas-woman-claiming-unborn-baby-hov-lane-hit-second-ticket-rcna45629,nottheonion,"A pregnant Texas woman who claimed she was entitled to drive in a high occupancy vehicle lane because of her unborn child received another ticket for the same offense, authorities said Tuesday.

Brandy Bottone, a 32-year-old Plano resident, became an unlikely focal point of the nation's post-Roe debate after she was pulled over in a carpool lane June 29.

A sheriff's deputy cited her for driving alone in the HOV lane that requires drivers to have at least one other person in the car — and Bottone claimed that the one other person was the unborn child in her womb.

She insisted that with the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade on June 24, her unborn child now was recognized as a living person.

Her argument was apparently good enough to win a dismissal. It wasn't immediately clear if that second ticket, picked up Aug. 3, would also be kicked out.

""Yes, Ms. Bottone’s HOV case was dismissed,"" a Dallas County district attorney's representative said in a statement to NBC News. ""The defendant received a second HOV citation about a month after the first. This second citation is currently pending.""

Bottone did not return several phone calls, emails and text messages Tuesday and Wednesday seeking her comment.

She told the Dallas Morning News on Sunday that the second HOV pullover happened on U.S. Highway 75 South near Midpark Road and the deputy knew exactly who she was.

“You again?” Bottone quoted the deputy as saying.

“So, when are you going to have this baby?” the deputy allegedly asked.

“Tomorrow,” Bottone said she answered.

“Oh, good luck,” she quoted the deputy as saying before issuing her the ticket.

Bottone has since given birth to a girl, the paper reported."

The Texas Medical Association (TMA) is raising the alarm on what they believe to be a growing number of cases in the state in which healthcare professionals are siding against providing care for women with severe pregnancy complications for fear of violating the state's abortion ban.

According to The Dallas Morning News' Allie Morris, a letter sent by members of the non-profit organization Wednesday to the Texas Medical Board claimed the association has received complaints regarding hospital administrators disallowing medical care providers from offering critical services to patients with ectopic pregnancies and other child birth complications."

On Tuesday, the Missouri Court of Appeals Western District published an opinion in favor of the woman, identified as M.O., who alleged that she contracted HPV during a sexual encounter in the insured's vehicle in 2017.

HPV or human papillomavirus can spread through direct sexual contact and cause warts on the genitals and surrounding areas.

""Insured 'negligently caused or contributed to cause [M.O.] to be infected with HPV by not taking proper precautions and neglecting to inform and/or disclose his diagnosis,' despite 'having knowledge of his condition,'” the opinion wrote.

M.O. asserted her then-boyfriend's car insurance policy covered her injuries and losses in a claim in 2021. Geico turned down her claim and she took matters to an arbitrator, who found the insured ""negligently infected M.O. with HPV and awarded her $5.2 million in damages,"" court documents said.

She then filed the motion with the trial court that ruled in her favor and confirmed the judgment of $5.2 million in damages for “past and future medical expenses,” as well as “past and future mental and physical pain and suffering.”

Geico appealed the judgment claiming they were not given ""meaningful opportunity to defend its interests,"" court documents said.

""But Geico did have the opportunity to participate and defend its interests – including the ability to challenge liability and damages – by entering a defense of Insured,"" the appeals court opinion said.

USA TODAY has reached out to the attorneys for both Geico and the woman and did not immediately hear back.

The appeals court also found that Geico did not have the right to “re-litigate” the issues after the award had been affirmed.

In a statement to CBS MoneyWatch, Geico said, ""The question of whether there is coverage for this matter will be determined"" by a federal lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri.

"Fentanyl released through vents at juvenile detention center in Williams Co., 7 taken to hospital",https://www.13abc.com/2022/03/21/crews-responding-emergency-situation-juvenile-detention-center-williams-county/,nottheonion,"STRYKER, Ohio (WTVG) - Seven people were taken to the hospital Sunday night after fentanyl was released through the air vents at the Northwest Ohio Juvenile Detention Training and Rehabilitation Center in Williams County, authorities said.

Three corrections officers and four juveniles who were detained in the facility were taken to the hospital, according to Jeff Lehman, chief deputy for the Williams County Sheriff’s Department. He but added that they’re stable and expected to be OK.

Investigators are looking into how the fentanyl was released.

The other detainees were moved to the Corrections Center of Northwest Ohio next door, Lehman said, and are being kept separate from the adults.

Multiple fire departments, ambulances and emergency personnel were at the facility in Stryker Sunday night, including those from neighboring counties.

"Phoenix priest who botched baptisms for decades apologizes, seeks to make amends",https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/250318/phoenix-priest-who-botched-baptisms-for-decades-apologizes-seeks-to-make-amends,nottheonion,"“The diocese is working closely with Fr. Andres and the parishes at which he was previously assigned to notify anyone who may have been baptized invalidly. Fr. Andres will be dedicating his time to helping and healing those affected,” the diocese said on its website.

Olmsted’s letter asked for prayers for the priest and “for all of those who are going to be impacted by this unfortunate situation.”

“I pledge to work diligently and swiftly to bring peace to those who have been affected, and I assure you that I and our diocesan staff are wholeheartedly committed to assisting those who have questions about their reception of the sacraments,” the bishop said.

He noted his own duty to be “vigilant” in overseeing the celebration of the sacraments and to ensure that they are “conferred in a manner that is in keeping with the commands of Jesus Christ in the Gospel and the requirements of sacred tradition.”

“It may seem legalistic, but the words that are spoken (the sacramental form), along with the actions that are performed and the materials used (the sacramental matter) are a crucial aspect of every sacrament,” said the diocese. As a priest may not substitute milk for wine during the Consecration of the Eucharist, nor may he change the words of baptism.

“Baptism is a requirement for salvation,” the Phoenix diocese said, recounting Christ's institution of the sacrament and the Catechism of the Catholic Church.

At the same time, the diocese sought to explain that God’s grace still can work if the sacraments were not validly administered.

“It is important to note that, while God instituted the sacraments for us, He is not bound by them,” the diocese said, reiterating Catholic sacramental theology. “Though they are our surest access to grace, God can grant His grace in ways known only to Him.”

Catholics can be certain that God works through the sacraments when properly conferred, but “we can be assured that all who approached God, our Father, in good faith to receive the sacraments did not walk away empty-handed,” the diocese said.

The failure to baptize validly caused major problems for one Oklahoma man who thought he was ordained a Catholic priest. He watched a video of his infant baptism and discovered he had been invalidly baptized by a Texas deacon who used the “we baptize” formula. The man was subsequently baptized, confirmed, given first Holy Communion, and ordained a deacon and then a priest.

In September 2020, Bishop Michael Olson of Fort Worth made public that the clergyman responsible for the invalid baptisms was Deacon Philip Webb, a now-retired permanent deacon ordained for the Diocese of Dallas but assigned to Saint Catherine of Siena Catholic Church in Carrollton, Texas, in the Diocese of Fort Worth. Anyone who was baptized by this deacon should be conditionally baptized and confirmed unless there is evidence that he validly baptized them, Olson said.

(Story continues below)

The Texas bishop said that priests and deacons who made these “grave errors of judgment” acted “without malice” but failed to fulfill their duties to administer the sacraments correctly.

“It is wrong and misleading to claim that one has the intention to do what the Church intends Baptism to do while using words different from the valid formula prescribed by the Church-and in the case of Baptism, prescribed by the Lord Himself,” Olson said.

Another priest, Father Matthew Hood of the Archdiocese of Detroit, similarly discovered he had not been validly baptized as an infant and so had to revisit the baptismal font as an adult, as well as subsequent sacraments."
Meta plans ‘Zuck bucks’ virtual coins for Facebook and Instagram users,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/07/meta-plans-zuck-bucks-virtual-coins-for-facebook-and-instagram-users?CMP=share_btn_wa,nottheonion,"Mark Zuckerberg is looking to develop virtual coins, nicknamed “Zuck bucks” by staff, for users of Facebook and Instagram as part of a suite of products designed to reduce his platforms’ dependence on advertising in the future metaverse.

Facebook’s parent group, Meta, is looking to develop a range of virtual products – including digital tokens and “creator coins” – to diversify income and revitalise its user base, which is increasingly turning to newer rivals such as TikTok.

While Meta remains the dominant social media network provider – its revenues rose 37% to $118bn in 2021 as advertisers clamoured to reach the 4.9 billion monthly active users of Facebook and Instagram – TikTok has also built up a massive non-ads business based on in-app purchases and e-commerce.

Meta, which has proven quick to ape successful products rolled out by rivals such as Snapchat, is now exploring ways to further monetise its user base, according to the Financial Times, which first reported the story.

Products being looked at include “social tokens” or “reputation tokens”, which could be used as rewards by users. It is also looking at “creator coins”, which could be used by influencers on Instagram.

Like Amazon’s Twitch, TikTok uses a tipping system whereby fans can buy its coins to then buy gifts to give to their favourite creators. Creators can also buy coins to use tools such as Promote to boost a TikTok video’s profile, increasing viewers or followers.

The initiatives, led by Facebook’s financial arm, Meta Financial Technologies, follow the company’s ill-fated foray into attempting to create a global cryptocurrency, a project called Libra and later Diem, which was abandoned earlier this year after issues with US regulators.

That was not the first time Facebook had looked to move into the world of virtual finance. In 2009 it launched Facebook Credits to facilitate in-app purchases in then highly popular games such as Zynga’s FarmVille. While successful, it was shut four years later after Facebook’s international growth made for costly foreign currency conversions.

Meta is also looking to enter the world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), with plans to allow their integration into Instagram and Facebook."

An unidentified man reportedly set his car on fire by driving into a U.S. Capitol barricade early Sunday morning. He then got out of his car and began firing a weapon indiscriminately before shooting himself, police say.

U.S. Capitol police say officers immediately responded when they heard the sound of gunfire at roughly 4 a.m. There were no reported injuries aside from the driver.

The man's motive in the incident is unknown. The incident reportedly lasted only a matter of moments, and officers did not have time to return fire before the man turned his weapon on himself.

""At this time, it does not appear the man was targeting any Members of Congress, who are on recess, and it does not appear officers fired their weapons,"" Capitol police said in a statement.

"Gohmert: ‘If you’re a Republican, you can’t even lie to Congress or lie to an FBI agent or they’re coming after you’",https://thehill.com/news/house/3511477-gohmert-if-youre-a-republican-you-cant-even-lie-to-congress-or-lie-to-an-fbi-agent-or-theyre-coming-after-you/,nottheonion,"Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) railed against the indictment of former Trump White House adviser Peter Navarro while saying in an interview on Friday that “if you’re a Republican, you can’t even lie to Congress or lie to an FBI agent or they’re coming after you.”

Gohmert, speaking to Newsmax in an interview on Friday, was asked to comment on the Friday indictment of Navarro by a federal grand jury after the former Trump official failed to comply with the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.

“It actually puts an exclamation point on the fact that we have a two-tiered justice system. If you’re a Republican, you can’t even lie to Congress or lie to an FBI agent or they’re coming after you. They’re gonna bury you. They’re gonna put you in the D.C. jail and terrorize and torture you and not live up to the Constitution there,” Gohmert responded.

He argued that there was a double standard to how Democrats and Republicans were being treated, pointing to the acquittal of prominent Democratic attorney Michael Sussmann, who was being investigated by special counsel John Durham, as one example.

“So [it’s] very clear. If you’re a Democrat, then you can lie. You can cheat. You can do whatever you want,” he said.

The Hill has reached out to Gohmert’s office for further comment and clarification on his remarks.

The development comes against the backdrop of Navarro’s indictment, who is facing two charges of criminal contempt of Congress after being subpoenaed by the House select committee.

The committee is interested in hearing from the former Trump official, looking to hear possible evidence regarding efforts to have the 2020 election results overturned by allies of former President Trump.

“Who are these people?” Navarro asked during his court appearance on Friday. “This is not America. I mean, I was a distinguished public servant for four years and nobody ever questioned my ethics. And they’re treating me in this fashion.”"
Single mom facing prison for having teen daughter babysit,https://www.wfla.com/news/crime/single-mom-facing-prison-for-having-teen-daughter-babysit/,nottheonion,"CHICAGO (NewsNation Now) — Melissa Henderson, who is a single mother of five, is facing a year in prison and a $1,000 fine after she left her children under the care of her oldest child, 14, while she went to work amid the pandemic.

Some people are calling her decision “reckless” while others are defending the mother’s actions.

Henderson said despite facing prison time, she will not accept a plea deal.

“I’m just gonna take each day as it comes because you can’t let things weigh on you like that,” she told NewsNation’s Ashleigh Banfield. “But you know, I just don’t feel that was right. So I’m not going to take the plea. I don’t feel that I did anything wrong.”

Henderson’s attorney, David DeLugas, told NewsNation’s Joe Donlon on Wednesday that his client’s case should be dismissed due to Georgia’s own child protection guidelines, which states children 13 years and older can take on the responsibility of babysitting.

“The mother did nothing wrong. In fact, the distinguishing point here is that the mother made a reasonable decision to leave her children in the care of the 14-year-old daughter,” DeLugas said.

Henderson, from Blairsville, Georgia, was left with very few options for child care when her children’s nursery was shut down in May 2020 due to the pandemic. In order to go to work, she decided to leave her daughter Linley in charge of her other siblings.

Linley was participating in remote learning when her 4-year-old brother Thaddeus slipped out of the house and went to his friend’s house down the street. About 10 to 15 minutes later, Linley noticed that her brother was gone, but quickly found him at the friend’s house.

The mother of the friend called the police to report the incident and Henderson was arrested two weeks later. She has been charged with criminal reckless conduct.

DeLugas said the charges against his client are unconstitutional.

“In 1997, the Georgia Supreme Court said that this statute is unconstitutional because it is vague. And more importantly, sheriffs and other law enforcement have too much discretion to decide what’s reckless and what’s not,” DeLugas said.

In the case, DeLugas said, a mom left her 11-year-old babysitting her younger sibling, who died in a tragic accident.

“So even then, the Supreme Court of Georgia said tragic, though it may be, it’s still not a crime for a mom to entrust a teenager with the care of a younger child. So … the statute was declared unconstitutional, and the charges were removed from that mom back in ’97. So that’s what makes this thing so pleasantly puzzling now.”

DeLugas has filed a motion to dismiss the case. He said he remains optimistic that the judge will take it into consideration. If not, DeLugas said he plans to appeal.

“I am going to appeal his decision not to grant it to the Georgia Supreme Court and let them wrestle with, ‘What’s the difference in the facts here versus the facts in 1997?’”

The case, which has been ongoing for two years, is weighing heavily on the family, according to DeLugas.

“It’s hanging over this family and it wears on the mom and even more … Linley, because she knows she’s responsible for what happened. Although again, nothing should have happened to her mom.”

To pay for Henderson’s legal expenses, a GoFundMe has been set up for her. The account so far has raised over $35,000."
Florida court says teen is not 'mature' enough to have an abortion,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/florida-court-says-teen-not-mature-enough-abortion-rcna43344,nottheonion,"A pregnant and parentless 16-year-old in Florida may be forced to give birth after an appeals court ruled she was not “sufficiently mature to decide whether to terminate her pregnancy.”

The teenager, who is identified in court papers as Jane Doe 22-B, was appealing a decision by Circuit Judge Jennifer Frydrychowicz on Aug. 10 that blocked her from having an abortion without the consent of a parent or guardian, as required by Florida law.

At the time, the teenager was 10 weeks pregnant, the court papers state.

But the three-judge panel of the state's 1st District Court of Appeal, which covers northern Florida, sided Monday, for the most part, with Frydrychowicz.

The teenager ""had not established by clear and convincing evidence that she was sufficiently mature to decide whether to terminate her pregnancy,” the ruling by Judges Harvey Jay, Rachel Nordby and Scott Makar, states. “Having reviewed the record, we affirm the trial court’s decision under the deferential standard of appellate review set out (in the consent law).”

Dissenting from the other judges, however, Makar wrote that the appeals court should send the case back to Frydrychowicz for the possibility of further consideration.

“The trial judge apparently sees this matter as a very close call, finding that the minor was 'credible,' 'open' with the judge, and nonevasive,"" Makar wrote. “The trial judge must have been contemplating that the minor — who was 10 weeks pregnant at the time — would potentially be returning before long — given the statutory time constraints at play — to shore up any lingering doubt the trial court harbored.”

Makar noted that the teenager is “parentless,” lives with a relative, but also has an appointed guardian. She was also savvy enough to do Google searches ""to gain an understanding about her medical options and their consequences.""

“She is pursuing a GED with involvement in a program designed to assist young women who have experienced trauma in their lives by providing educational support and counseling,” Makar wrote. “The minor experienced renewed trauma (the death of a friend) shortly before she decided to seek termination of her pregnancy.”

Makar also noted that in her petition, which ""she completed by hand,"" the teenager insisted ""she is sufficiently mature to make the decision, saying she 'is not ready to have a baby,' she doesn’t have a job, she is 'still in school,' and the father is unable to assist her.""

The ""guardian is fine with what [she] wants to do"" the teenager claimed, according to Makar.

The teenager's guardian and case worker were with her in court.

But ""inexplicably,"" Makar wrote, the teenager ""checked the box indicating she did not request an attorney, which is available by law for free under the statute.""

Makar also noted that Frydrychowicz ""displayed concern for the minor’s predicament throughout the hearing.""

""She asked difficult questions of the minor on sensitive personal matters in a compassionate manner,"" Makar wrote. ""The trial judge’s tone and method of questioning were commendable.""

NBC News has reached out to Frydrychowicz, a registered Republican who also serves on the board of the Escambia Children’s Trust, which runs educational and other programs for kids in the county, for comment.

Florida voters approved a constitutional amendment in 2004 that cleared the way for the state Legislature to pass a law requiring that parents or guardians be notified before minors have abortions.

But because some minors faced possible abuse if their parents found out they're pregnant, Florida lawmakers also included a legal process that made it possible for them to go to court to get around the rules.

Then in June of 2020, Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is also a Republican, signed SB 404, legislation which requires written consent from a minor’s parent or legal guardian for an abortion.

“Thanks to Ron DeSantis, Florida is now forcing a teenager to give birth against her will,"" Florida Democratic Party spokesman Travis Reuther said in a statement. ""That is an appalling and dangerous overreach by the Governor, who claims to represent the ‘free state of Florida,’ but wants to make women’s healthcare decisions for them.""

NBC News has reached out to DeSantis for a response.

Abortion rights in Florida were endangered even before the Supreme Court in June overturned Roe v. Wade. In April, DeSantis signed into law a measure banning abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, a measure that is being challenged in court."
ANC councillor arrested for allegedly killing his predecessor; he was “chief mourner” at his funeral,https://www.iol.co.za/dailynews/news/kwazulu-natal/anc-councillor-arrested-for-allegedly-killing-his-predecessor-he-was-chief-mourner-at-his-funeral-76dcb076-34cd-4e86-b8c8-d3c05219c1ab#Echobox=1653900111,nottheonion,"Durban - An ANC councillor in the eThekwini region has been arrested for allegedly killing his predecessor. The identity of the councillor is known to the Daily News, but it will not be revealed until he has appeared in court.

The councillor was one of the “chief mourners” at the funeral of the person he is accused of killing. He was also part of the ANC delegation that visited the family to mourn his killing. On Monday morning, after days of secrecy, the ANC in the region admitted the councillor had been arrested. Over the weekend, the Daily News was tipped off the councillor had not been seen in public for days because the SAPS task team on political killings had taken him in for questioning. The investigators were reportedly convinced he was behind his predecessor’s murder.

The ANC in the region said although everyone was innocent until proven guilty, it shared the pain of the victims of political killings. Mlondo Mkhize, spokesperson of the ANC in the eThekwini region, said the arrest was in connection with the murders of Siyabonga Mkhize and Mzukisi Nyanga in Cato Crest last year. ANC national executive committee member Bheki Cele leaving the home of Cato Crest ward councillor Siyabonga Mkhize who was shot and killed. Picture: Doctor Ngcobo/African News Agency (ANA) “While we understand and accept the principle of natural justice that a person is presumed innocent until proven otherwise, we however call for justice for our fallen comrades,” Mkhize said.

“We stand with the families of our fallen comrades and we want to see justice.” Mkhize said a citizen’s freedom was threatened each time a member of the community was murdered or robbed. They therefore implored law enforcement agencies to be firm and act decisively to continue to root out rogue elements that were behind the murders. He said members of the community must unwaveringly work with the police to help isolate the criminals.

“We will be watching this case closely up until its final stages,” Mkhize said. “Importantly, we wish to assure the community affected by the absence of the councillor, who is currently in custody, that the ANC will deploy a PR councillor to service the community.” Mkhize said that when the people of eThekwini went to the polls, they voted for services such as water, electricity, housing, road infrastructure, jobs and access to economic opportunities. Therefore, the municipality would never let them down.

“Finally, we further call upon all ANC volunteers to continue to mobilise communities to stand up against any form of crime. “We must intensify the fight against crime, in all its manifestations – from the unacceptable level of murders, assaults, robberies, high-jacking to domestic violence. The culture of impunity should not be tolerated in this region,” Mkhize said. Residents who fall under that ward have said the area had been without water for two days and they have had many power outages that lasted up to 48 hours.

Mkhize had been with three others in this car when the attack happened. Picture: Supplied There were calls to ramp up the councillor’s security after he survived a murder attempt on his life. The councillor was at a meeting over the second weekend of March to elect a new ANC branch leadership and ward committee members. As he was leaving the meeting, gunmen followed him and started shooting. The councillor reportedly sped off and was not hit by a bullet."

A North Carolina bill aims to ban free EV charging on private and public property unless free gasoline and diesel are also provided.,https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a40543385/north-carolina-wants-remove-free-public-ev-chargers/,nottheonion,"Politicians have to run on some kind of platform, and Ben Moss—my incoming state House representative here in North Carolina's District 52—decided that his animating principle is Being Mad at Electricity. To prove his animosity toward this invisible menace, he's sponsoring House Bill 1049, which would allocate $50,000 to destroy free public car chargers. It contains some other enlightened ideas, but that's the main theme: We've simply got to do something about these free public chargers, even if it costs us $50,000! Those things cost tens of cents per hour, when they're being used.

Of course, there's a caveat here. Moss isn't saying that free public Level 2 chargers—of which there are three in my town, with plans in the works to convert to paid kiosks—definitely need to get crushed by a monster truck. That rule only comes into play if a town refuses to build free gas and diesel pumps next to the EV chargers. So anyway, warm up El Toro Loco, we're smashin' some car zappers!

These public DC fast-chargers are not free. But imagine if they were! That would be outrageous. Car and Driver

But what about private businesses? you ask. Don't worry, Moss hasn't forgotten that a business might put a charger on its property as an inducement for EV owners to patronize the establishment. And small business is the heart of the local economy. That's why he's staying out of the way when it comes to private property. Just kidding! Ben Moss cares about the consumers being harmed by these hypothetical free chargers—namely, any customer who arrived via internal-combustion vehicle, or on foot, or in a sedan chair. Why is someone else gaining some advantage based on a decision they made? That's not how life works.

Thus, House Bill 1049 decrees that all customer receipts will have to show what share of the bill went toward the charger out in the lot. That way, anyone who showed up for dinner in an F-150 (not the electric one) can get mad that their jalapeño poppers helped pay for a business expense not directly related to them. It's the same way you demand to know how much Applebee's spends to keep the lights on in its parking lot overnight, when you're not there. Sure, this will be an accounting nightmare, but it'll all be worth it if we can prevent even one person from adding 16 miles of charge to a Nissan Leaf while eating a bloomin' onion—not that restaurants around here have free chargers, but you can't be too careful. Now, there is a charger at the neighborhood Ford dealership, which is marking up Broncos by $20,000. Coincidence? I think not.

This is probably to help pay the exorbitant costs of their on-site Level 2 car charger. Car and Driver

Critics of this bill might point out that increasing the number of electric cars could actually benefit owners of internal-combustion vehicles, thanks to reduced demand for petroleum products—kind of like how, during the Colonial Pipeline gas shortage, there were no Ford Mustang Mach-Es in line at the local pumps. Or, to put it another way, if the price of paste skyrockets because your local politicians eat so much paste, those prices might come down if you could get them to eat some crayons. But good luck with that! Paste is delicious.

Electron heads, as I call them, also like to point out that electricity is generated domestically, so your transportation dollars are staying in the U.S. rather than going to, say, Saudi Arabia. And if you really want to keep your money in your community, you can hire a local company to install solar panels and make your own electricity. District 52 includes numerous electricians, and Duke Energy utility workers, and solar installers. But no oil rig workers—yet!

If it doesn’t cost this much to charge an electric car, that’s not fair. Car and Driver

Which brings me to another point that's not at all related but I'll make it anyway: What we need in this area is more jobs, not more free public car chargers. And yes, electric-car company VinFast is building a 2000-acre factory just up the road that will employ 7500 people, and Toyota is building a battery factory outside Greensboro that'll employ 1750 people. But let's remember that House Bill 1049 would also create a job, for the person who goes around and rips out the free public chargers—until that's done, which would probably be the better part of a week.

And in fact, we could create even more jobs if we extended this philosophy to other public facilities that not everybody uses. Why should there be a library when I don't like books? Why are there schools? I'm not a kid. Don't get me started on all those roads that go places I've never been, and all those town fire trucks that haven't come to my house except for that one time. Maybe we don't tear all that stuff down, just as long as we can instill the general feeling that someone else is getting away with something.

I don't know about you, but I'm feeling it already."
"Hinson Takes Credit for Infrastructure Funds She Labeled as ‘Socialist,’ Voted Against",https://iowastartingline.com/2022/01/19/hinson-takes-credit-for-infrastructure-funds-she-labeled-as-socialist-voted-against/,nottheonion,"US Rep. Ashley Hinson compared the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to socialism, but that didn’t stop her from taking credit for funds from the legislation that she voted against.

The US Army Corps of Engineers allocated $829.1 million from the infrastructure bill to modernize the lock and dam system on the upper Mississippi and Illinois rivers. The Mississippi River runs alongside a portion of Hinson’s congressional district.

In sharing a press release from her office about the project, Hinson tweeted “BREAKING: We secured $829 million in federal funding to upgrade locks & dams along the Upper Mississippi River.”

BREAKING: We secured $829 million in federal funding to upgrade locks & dams along the Upper Mississippi River. This is game-changing for Iowa’s agriculture industry & our Mississippi River communities! https://t.co/4rql7Y8oft — Ashley Hinson (@RepAshleyHinson) January 19, 2022

While it is true Hinson has advocated for targeted infrastructure updates on Iowa’s waterways, the Republican freshman legislator not only voted against the infrastructure act that’s funding the Mississippi River project, she slammed it as “Washington Gamesmanship” when it passed.

“Too often in Washington, the potential for important, bipartisan policy is torpedoed by partisan politics,” Hinson said in a Nov. 8 release. “The need to make meaningful investments in our nation’s real infrastructure—roads and bridges, locks and dams, and broadband—was sacrificed to advance a partisan, socialist spending spree.”

The release came three days after Hinson voted “no” and delivered a floor speech in the US House criticizing the bill. Hinson also compared the infrastructure bill to Marxism in her Nov. 8 press release.

“It’s the biggest leap toward socialism this nation has ever seen—it takes the Marxist ideology that once only existed in textbooks and makes it law in the United States of America,” she said.

Hinson, who is up for reelection in the fall, is being challenged by Democrat Liz Mathis to represent Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District. Mathis, an Iowa state senator, called out Hinson’s news release as an attempt to “mislead Iowans.”

“Despite Ashley Hinson’s attempt to claim credit for this much-needed investment, she voted against the bill that made it possible,” Mathis said. “This is yet another example of Ashley Hinson claiming that she supports investments that benefit Iowans, but voting along party lines against their best interests in Washington. Iowa’s 2nd District deserves a representative who will work across the aisle to pass legislation and secure funding that directly benefits the district she represents.”

Of Iowa’s six federal delegates, only Democratic Rep. Cindy Axne and Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley voted in favor of the infrastructure bill.

The Infrastructure act will allocate about $5 billion to Iowa and is expected to create a plethora of good-paying jobs.

According to a White House fact sheet, over five years Iowa will receive $3.4 billion for roads, $638 million for water-quality projects, $432 million for bridge repair and replacement, $302 million for public transportation, $120 million for airports, $100 million for broadband, $51 million for an electric vehicle charging network, and more.

Mom raises awareness after son is diagnosed with uncombable hair syndrome,https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Family/mom-raises-awareness-son-diagnosed-uncombable-hair-syndrome/story?id=83091244,nottheonion,"The 1-year-old is now the star of his own Instagram page.

A Georgia mom is on a mission to spread joy and raise awareness after her 1-year-old son was diagnosed with uncombable hair syndrome, a hair disorder she’d never heard of until last year.

The boy’s mother, Katelyn Samples, told “Good Morning America” that a stranger messaged her last summer on Instagram after seeing a photo of her youngest son, Locklan Samples, and asked if he had been diagnosed with uncombable hair syndrome.

“At first, you see ‘syndrome’ and you're like, ‘Oh my gosh,’ like is something wrong with my baby? Is he in pain or something?” Samples recalled.

She added, “I just went in a tailspin and did a Google deep dive, called his pediatrician and the pediatrician even was like, ‘Hang on, let us look into this.’ They hadn't even heard of it. So they sent us to a specialist, a pediatric dermatologist at Emory in Atlanta and that's where we were able to get the diagnosis.”

What is uncombable hair syndrome?

Uncombable hair syndrome is a rare hair disorder and a genetic condition that usually affects children between the ages of three months to three years, although there have been reports of cases in kids up to age 12. According to the NIH, only about 100 cases have been reported in medical studies but experts say there could be more unreported cases.

“People might just be like, ‘Oh, my child has unruly hair or hair that's difficult to tame, but they might not have sought a medical professional, like a pediatrician or dermatologist to formally diagnose the condition,” Dr. Carol Cheng, a pediatric dermatologist at UCLA Health told “GMA.”

According to Dr. Cheng, children with uncombable hair syndrome, also called spun glass hair, can have hair that grows in all directions and their hair can be straw-colored, have a dull texture, or be hard to manage.

A specialist can diagnose uncombable hair syndrome through a genetic test and an examination of a hair clipping through electron microscopy, a process that uses a special type of microscope.

“When you look under that microscope, you can see that instead of having hairs that are cylinder shape … the shaft of the hair is actually more in a triangular shape,” Dr. Cheng explained. “Within the triangle, there (are) these little grooves that go up and down the long axis of the hair shaft so that's why it makes it really uncombable.”

“To diagnose the condition, at least 50% of the hairs would have this abnormality, but not all the hairs have to be abnormal,” Dr. Cheng added.

For the genetic test, doctors would look for three specific genes that have been associated with the syndrome, she said.

“The three genes that were found are what we call an autosomal recessive condition, meaning that both the mom and the dad have to have one of these genes and pass it on to the child who's affected,” Dr. Cheng said. “It can also be inherited in what we call an autosomal dominant condition where only one of the parents has to have this genetic trait to pass on to their child.”

Living with uncombable hair syndrome

Despite the syndrome's name, Samples said she can still comb Locklan’s hair for now but she doesn’t need to do so often, and overall, it’s relatively low maintenance.

“It can get matted easily. It is very fragile. … It can get tangled and I do have to be careful,"" she said. ""That would be an example of a time I actually would wash it because I very rarely wash his hair. Just doesn't need to be, it doesn't really get greasy.”

The mother of two said other people have been very curious about Locklan’s hair both in public and online. “We get a lot of comments about him looking like a dandelion and that's actually a very accurate description of appearance and how it feels,"" Samples said. ""His hair is extremely soft, like a little baby chick. People will ask to touch it, which is fine with us, as long as people ask.""

Samples has been sharing Locklan’s story and photos on Instagram since his diagnosis, In a post from October, she wrote that she wanted to do so in part “to spread some joy on the internet!”

“Our biggest message is to celebrate what makes you stand out and what makes you different and hopefully bring awareness to this uncombable hair syndrome and hopefully, we can get more information,” Samples said. “If you think your kid might have it, go inquire and ask questions and be your child's advocate.”

There are no formal treatments for uncombable hair syndrome and the hair abnormalities tend to resolve themselves as time goes on.

“Interestingly, this condition does get better with age. So after puberty or into adulthood, typically the hair condition does get better,” Dr. Cheng noted. “It doesn't stay with them for their entire life.”"
California police department investigates officers blaring Disney music,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/15/california-police-disney-music-investigation,nottheonion,"A California police department has launched an investigation into its own officers who were filmed blaring copyrighted Disney music in attempts to prevent residents from recording them.

The incident in question occurred during a vehicle search on the night of 4 April, when residents in Santa Ana, a city near Los Angeles, woke up to a series of Disney songs being blasted outside their windows. The songs included Toy Story’s You Got a Friend in Me, Encanto’s We Don’t Talk About Bruno, Mulan’s Reflection and Coco’s Un Poco Loco.

According to a video posted on YouTube, the songs emerged from a police cruiser that belonged to police officers who were investigating a stolen vehicle.

In the video, a woman can be heard asking the officers, “What’s the music for?,” saying that she was unable to sleep.

Johnathan Hernandez, a Santa Ana city councilman, is later seen in the video, asking the police officers, “Guys, what’s going on with the music here?”

An unnamed officer told Hernandez that he was playing the music from his phone and on the cruiser’s PA system in an attempt to prevent a resident, who was recording him, from continuing to do so. The officer explained that it had to do with “copyright infringement.”

Hernandez went on to ask the officer if he knew who he was, to which he replied, “You’re a city councilperson.”

“Absolutely … and this is my district. You’re not going to conduct yourself like that in front of my neighbors,” Hernandez can be heard saying.

The officer then apologized repeatedly to Hernandez and to the individual filming the incident.

“My people live here, brother. Please treat them with respect ... There’s kids that need to go to school. There’s people that are working. You chose to use our taxpayer dollars to disrespect a man with your music. That’s childish, sir,” Hernandez told the officer.

In a statement to the Washington Post, Hernandez explained that his neighbors were afraid and confused by the behavior. He added that he found it ironic that the police were playing songs from Encanto and Coco in a mostly Latino neighborhood.

“Those were films that were used to bridge the Latino community,” said Hernandez, “and police are using them to silence it.”

The Santa Ana police department has responded to the incident, saying that it is investigating the officers involved.

“We are committed to serving our community and we understand the concerns as it relates to the video. The Santa Ana police department takes seriously all complaints regarding the service provided by the department and the conduct of its employees. Our department is committed to conducting complete, thorough, and objective investigations,” it said.

The incident reflects an apparently growing trend in which police officers play copyrighted music in order to prevent videos of them from being posted on to social media platforms such as YouTube and Instagram, which can remove content that includes unauthorized content.

Last July, a police officer in Oakland, California was filmed blasting Taylor Swift’s Blank Space as he was confronted by several activists on the steps of a courthouse.

Similarly, in February last year, an individual who filmed his visit to the Beverly Hills Police Station, where he sought to obtain body camera footage, encountered an officer who began playing Sublime’s Santeria."

Russian diplomat dismisses sanctions: 'We're used to it',https://thehill.com/policy/international/russia/595270-russian-diplomat-dismisses-sanctions-were-used-to-it,nottheonion,"Russian diplomat Sergey Lavrov on Tuesday dismissed increased calls for sanctions against the country as tensions with Ukraine ratchet up, noting that Russia is “used to it.”

“Well, we’re used to it. We know that sanctions will be imposed anyway, in any case. With or without reason,” Lavrov said of the threats of sanctions from Western countries, according to Reuters.

The comments from Lavrov come amid reports that Russian troops have moved into two breakaway territories in Ukraine.

The EU had said earlier this week that they would impose sanctions against Russia in response to the country placing troops on Ukrainian soil.

Russian President Vladimir Putin pushed back on allegations of escalating tensions in Ukraine, saying that the Russian forces were deployed to the country for “peacekeeping” reasons.

“Our European, American, British colleagues will not stop and will not calm down until they have exhausted all their possibilities for the so-called punishment of Russia,” Lavrov reportedly added on Tuesday.

“They are already threatening us with all manner of sanctions or, as they say now, ‘the mother of all sanctions,’ ” he said, according to Reuters."

That's because Zuckerberg thinks social media is best when used to communicate. On a recent episode of the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, the Meta CEO said he thinks platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter can be beneficial to users' well-being — but primarily when they're used to connect with others.

""If you're just sitting there and consuming stuff, I mean, it's not necessarily bad, but it generally isn't associated with all the positive benefits you get from being actively engaged or building relationships,"" the tech billionaire said.

Zuckerberg isn't the only one discouraging that sort of social media over-consumption. Research indicates excessive use of social media can lead to depression and anxiety among some users. But experts also say that's only true if people are using platforms to solely scroll, rather than interact with others.

""Routine social media use"" — like ""responding to content others share"" daily — is actually linked to positive social well-being and overall mental health, a 2019 study conducted by Harvard University researchers suggests.

However, the opposite becomes true when people develop too much of a dependence on social media, or an unhealthy emotional connection."
"Texas judge arrested, charged with cattle theft and organized crime",https://www.kxan.com/news/texas/texas-judge-arrested-charged-with-cattle-theft-and-organized-crime/,nottheonion,"MENTONE, Texas — A Special Ranger with the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association arrested Loving County Judge Skeet Lee Jones on Friday. Jones was charged with theft of livestock and engaging in organized crime.

The special ranger said an investigation had been ongoing for a year. Judge Jones and three others were accused of picking up estray (loose) cattle and selling them. Officially the judge was charged for the theft of three head of cattle. But the special ranger said more than likely there will be additional charges.

Jones was taken to the nearby Winkler County jail.

It was not Judge Jones’ first brush with trouble. In 2016, the State Commission on Judicial Conduct issued a public warning and order of additional education.

The commission said Jones changed speeding tickets into parking violations. The violator would pay a higher fine but still keep a clean driving record. The commission said the parking fines were in excess of amounts allowed by law.

At that time, Judge Jones was ordered to complete 10 hours of instruction.

As for the current case, EverythingLubbock.com reached out the Winkler County Sheriff’s Office to request a copy of Jones’ booking photo and information on how much bond Jones would need to post to get out of jail. We will provide an update when possible."

Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko has said Russian media that he can forgive lesbians but not gay men.

He denied being aware of the German foreign minister Guido Westerwelle’s sexual orientation when he said he would rather be a dictator than gay in what was seen as a scornful comment about Guido Westerwelle, reports Euronews.

“I forgive women for their lesbianism. But I will never in my lifetime forgive men for being gay… A woman becomes a lesbian only if we men are so wretched.”

The president also denied reports that he was readying his son or anyone else as a leader-in-waiting.

“To be honest, I never think in these terms. I swore that I will never hand over power to my relatives, to my in-laws or children. It’s out of the question,” he said.

American Jewish Committee demands Musk apologize for comparing Trudeau to Hitler,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/american-jewish-committee-demands-musk-apologize-for-comparing-trudeau-to-hitler-1.5785552,nottheonion,"Elon Musk compared Prime Minister Justin Trudeau with Adolf Hitler in a tweet that appeared to support truckers protesting vaccine mandates -- and which immediately triggered a storm on Twitter.

Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, in late January tweeted support for the Canadian truckers, who have shut down roads and bridges, drawing international attention to their opposition to health policies pushed by Trudeau's government.

Responding to a tweet describing how Trudeau's government had ordered banks to help cut funding to the protesters, Musk posted a meme of a photo of Hitler, with ""Stop comparing me to Justin Trudeau"" written above his head and ""I had a budget"" below it. It appears that he later deleted the post.

Tesla did not respond to an email requesting further comment.

The tweet came as Musk and Tesla on Thursday accused the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of an ""endless"" investigation to punish Musk for criticism of the U.S. government.

Musk has 74 million followers on Twitter, making his one of its most prominent accounts. That is often seen as a marketing boon for electric car maker Tesla.

Musk is known for edgy humour and blunt assessments, but his comparison of Trudeau with the Nazi leader, who was responsible for the genocide of millions of Jews and starting World War Two, went too far for many Twitter users.

""@elonmusk making a disgusting comparison of Trudeau to Hitler. Don’t do this kind of stuff. You just look dumb,"" wrote @ElliotMalin.

The American Jewish Committee responded to Musk's tweet with a call for an immediate apology.

But his tweet also had more than 35,000 likes, more than 9,000 retweets and many positive responses."

Penguins refuse to eat cheaper fish as inflation hits Japanese aquarium,https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/penguins-refuse-to-eat-cheaper-fish-as-inflation-hits-japanese-aquarium-1.5978364,nottheonion,"An aquarium employee waves a mackerel near a penguin -- but there's no reaction. When she moves the fish closer to its beak, the penguin turns away haughtily. An otter sniffs the fish, then runs away.

For the penguins and otters at Japan's Hakone-en Aquarium, an hour's drive southwest of Tokyo, inflation and rising prices have meant a change in diet -- and the animals are not happy about it.

Before, the aquarium offered penguins and otters ""aji,"" or Japanese horse mackerel, which the animals readily ate.

But the aquarium, home to 32,000 animals including sharks and seals, was not immune to the economic woes plaguing many global economies. The price of aji has increased by 20 per cent to 30 per cent since last year, the aquarium said.

So to cut costs, in May the aquarium switched to a cheaper alternative -- ""saba,"" or mackerel.

It has not been well received, with aquarium workers having to get creative to encourage the animals to eat -- for instance, the otters and penguins appear more willing to eat the mackerel when mixed with their favorite aji.

""Ideally, they would like to have a full aji, but they are patiently eating mackerel,"" aquarium keeper Hiroki Shimamoto told CNN affiliate TV Asahi.

The aquarium is also cutting costs by reducing the number of circulation pumps from two to one, which has reduced its electricity bill by 40 per cent to 50 per cent.

""We could raise the admission fee to the aquarium and fix this issue, but we would like to do our best to keep our facility a comfortable place for our guests to visit. We do not plan on raising admission prices,"" Shimamoto said.

The aquarium says penguins and otters have their preferred type of fish and the aquarium tries its best to accommodate their needs.

""All of the animals at the aquarium are family and we do our best to keep them healthy,"" it said. ""We would never force any animal to eat what they don't want. We would like to have as many people (as possible) come and visit Hakone and enjoy our animals."""
Tucker Carlson on running for president: ‘I guess if like I was the last person on Earth’,https://thehill.com/homenews/media/559372-tucker-carlson-on-running-for-president-i-guess-if-like-i-was-the-last-person/,nottheonion,"Fox News’s Tucker Carlson said he has no interest in running for the White House during an interview Friday with the conservative podcast “Ruthless.”

“Oh God, come on! Yeah. I’ll be running,” Carlson said facetiously when asked if he was running for president.

Carlson said the job has no appeal to him and would also not be very popular with his family.

“That seems like a fun job. I’m sure my poor children would love that. Can you imagine?” he said. “I’ve known and talked to every president, you know, for a while, for like more than 30 years. And you know, I can’t think of anyone whose life was improved by that.”

“I mean, I guess if like I was the last person on earth, I could do it, but I mean, it seems pretty unlikely that I would be that guy,” he added.

The answer was Carlson’s latest declaration he has no interest in running for president.

Talk of a possible Carlson White House bid has taken place given the popularity of his show, which is often the most highly rated program on cable television.

In July, political strategists, commentators and several leading Republicans told Politico the 2024 GOP nomination was Carlson’s if he wanted it.

“Let me put it this way: If Biden wins and Tucker decided to run, he’d be the nominee,” Sam Nunberg, a former top political aide, told Politico.

Republican political Vernon Robinson even predicted that Carlson “will be the Republican nominee” in an interview with The Independent last September.

But Carlson has dismissed the idea, at least as far back as 2019 during a keynote address at a conservative gathering, according to National Review.

“If I were running for president — which obviously I would never do, I would be insane to run for president, I would never do that,” Carlson said while offering advice to Republican politicians on how to appeal to voters during his keynote address at the National Conservatism Conference.

And Carlson has made similarly dismissive statements about a possible presidential candidacy to other outlets: “No I’m not running for anything — come on,” he told Mediaite in a podcast interview last August."

The company, called Lions Not Sheep, sells clothing on a variety of platforms, claiming its products are made in the U.S.

Lions Not Sheep is a Utah business owned by Sean Whalen.

The FTC now says Whalen must pay $211,335 and cease all fraudulent activity regarding his business claims of America-made products.

The complaint was originally made in May 2022 and ordered the company to:

Stop making bogus Made in USA claims, and

Come clean about foreign production.

A statement from the FTC read, “Under the order, Whalen and Lions Not Sheep must stop claiming that products are made in the United States unless they can show that the product’s final assembly or processing—and all significant processing—takes place here and that all or virtually all ingredients or components of the product are made and sourced here.”"
"Protesters glue themselves to car showroom floor, then complain when staff turn out the lights and go home.",https://www.joe.co.uk/news/climate-activists-volkswagen-dealership-364190,nottheonion,"The protestors claim they were denied a ‘bowl to urinate and defecate in’

Climate activists were left in a sticky situation after deciding to glue themselves to the floor of a Volkswagen dealership.

Members of Scientist Rebellion, who are a collection of academics affiliated with Extinction Rebellion, stuck themselves to the concrete floor of the Porsche pavilion at Autostadt and the Volkswagen luxury cars exhibit in Wolfsburg, Germany.

But they perhaps didn’t get the response they were looking for from workers at the facility come the end of the day.

When it was time for staff to go home, they simply switched off the lights and the heating and left the scientists on their own.

One of the protestors also claims the workers denied their request for a “bowl to urinate and defecate in.”

Gianluca Grimalda took to Twitter to complain about how staff at the car manufacturer didn’t do anything to help them.

He said: “They refused our request to provide us with a bowl to urinate and defecate in a decent manner while we are glued, and have turned off the heating.”

.@VW told us that they supported our right to protest, but they refused our request to provide us with a bowl to urinate and defecate in a decent manner while we are glued, and have turned off the heating.

Some of the activists apparently went on hunger strike until their demands were met.

Scientist Rebellion say that they targeted the Volkswagen dealership in Germany because the the country’s national economy has “benefited much more than others from burning fossil fuels and exploitation of resources”.

They have also accused Germany of failing “badly at achieving its climate and biodiversity targets.”

The protestors spent the night inside the dealership, but Gianluca said the damage done to his hand as a result of glueing it to the floor has been immense.

He said his hand became swollen and a doctor had to be brought in to assess it.

“Doctors ascertained the possibility of life-threatening blood clots in my hand and recommended an immediate transfer to a hospital,” he said.

“My health is of course paramount. I accepted to leave this wonderful group and was taken to hospital, continuing my hunger strike.”

He explained that the group has three main demands for Volkswagen.

They want the company to “support the introduction of speed limits on German motorways”, “condone bonds held by VW from Global South”, and “declare infeasibility of 1.5C degrees goal.” Meanwhile, it’s been a busy day for climate activists here in the UK as well. Just Stop Oil protestors have scaled the Dartford Crossing and thrown soup at a famous Van Gogh painting in the last week.

Pittsburgh bridge collapses ahead of Biden's visit to talk about infrastructure,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/pittsburgh-bridge-collapses-ahead-bidens-visit-talk-infrastructure-rcna13934,nottheonion,"Ten people were injured Friday morning when a snow-covered bridge in Pittsburgh collapsed ahead of President Joe Biden's scheduled visit to the area to talk about infrastructure.

Pittsburgh Public Safety announced at about 7 a.m. that the bridge, in Frick Park, had collapsed.

Three of the people hurt were a driver and two passengers who were on a bus when the bridge collapsed. Crews formed a human chain to help rescue multiple people from the bus, which was left dangling off the bridge, The Associated Press reported.

Responders who slipped and fell were also among the injured.

Darryl Jones, the city's fire chief, said crews had to rappel about 100 feet to help people, according to NBC affiliate WPXI of Pittsburgh.

Officials had urged everyone to avoid the area. The collapse caused a large gas leak, according to Pittsburgh Public Safety.

Some families were evacuated from nearby homes, but they were cleared to return by the afternoon.

Witnesses said the loud noise from the collapse was followed by a hissing sound and the smell of natural gas.

“The first sound was much more intense, and kind of a rumbling, which I guess was the structure, the deck hitting the ground,” Ken Doyno, a resident who lives four houses away, said. “I mean, the whole house rattled at that point.”

Douglas Gwilym, who was shoveling about an inch of snow when he heard the noise, said the collapse ""sounded like a weather phenomenon more than anything.""

A spokesperson for the National Transportation Safety Board said Friday the agency was sending a team of about 10 people to investigate “not only what happened but why it happened.”

Search and rescue teams were searching under the bridge to make sure people were not trapped, according to Pittsburgh Public Safety.

Aerial drone footage showed four snow-covered vehicles and the bus remained on the collapsed bridge. Another car was overturned on one side of the bridge.

The collapse prompted Pittsburgh Public Schools officials to transition all K-5, K-8, 6-8 and special schools to remote learning for the day ""due to the impact of a bridge collapse in the East End and a high volume of bus driver call-offs."" Several neighbors said a two-hour school delay due to weather may have prevented a far worse human tragedy.

Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf said his team was ""monitoring the situation in Pittsburgh and prepared to provide support as needed.""

""Pittsburgh residents: Please stay safe and continue to avoid the area,"" he wrote on Twitter.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden would still make the trip to West Mifflin, 10 miles outside of Pittsburgh, “and will stay in touch with officials on the ground about additional assistance we can provide.”

She said the president “is grateful to the first responders who rushed to assist the drivers who were on the bridge at the time.”

Biden is set to deliver a speech to promote his $1 trillion infrastructure law, which has earmarked about $1.6 billion for Pennsylvania bridge maintenance.

Beforehand, he visited the site of the bridge collapse.

""I didn’t realize there were more bridges in Pittsburgh than in any city in the world, more than in Venice,"" he said. ""And we’re going to fix them all. It's not a joke. This is going to be a gigantic change.""

At the site of the collapse, Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman called it “just an awful, surreal scene.”

“I hope it’s a wake-up call to the nation that we need to make these infrastructure investments,” Fetterman said.

The bridge is an important artery that leads to the Squirrel Hill and Oakland neighborhoods, and a popular route toward downtown Pittsburgh.

It was most recently inspected in September, but the report was not immediately available.

A September 2019 inspection of the city-owned bridge revealed the deck and superstructure to be in poor condition, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation’s National Bridge Inventory. A spreadsheet on the state Department of Transportation website listed the bridge’s overall condition as poor, which, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, means “deterioration of primary structural elements has advanced.”"
Chicago police are no longer allowed to chase people on foot just for running away,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/chicago-police-are-no-longer-allowed-chase-people-foot-just-running-aw-rcna34599,nottheonion,"CHICAGO — Chicago police officers will no longer be allowed to chase people on foot simply because they run away or give chase over minor offenses, the department said Tuesday, more than a year after two foot pursuits ended with officers fatally shooting a 13-year-old boy and 22-year-old man.

The new policy adheres closely to a draft policy put in place after those shootings and gives the department something it has never had: permanent rules about when officers can and can’t engage in an activity that can endanger themselves, those they’re chasing and bystanders.

“The safety of our community members and our officers remain at the core of this new foot pursuit policy,” Superintendent David Brown said in a statement announcing the policy, which will be implemented by the end of the summer. “We collaborated internally with our officers and externally with our residents to develop a policy we all have a stake in.”

Under the policy, officers may give chase if they believe a person is committing or about to commit a felony, a Class A misdemeanor such as domestic battery, or a serious traffic offense such as drunken driving and street racing that could risk injuring others.

Officers won’t be allowed to chase people on foot if they suspect them of minor offenses such as parking violations, driving on suspended licenses or drinking alcohol in public. But they will still have discretion to people who they’ve determined are committing or about to commit crimes that post “an obvious threat to any person.”

Perhaps most significantly, the policy makes clear that the days of officers giving chase just because someone tries to avoid them are over.

“People may avoid contact with a member for many reasons other than involvement in criminal activity,” the policy states.

The names of 13-year-old Adam Toledo and 22-year-old Anthony Alvarez, who were armed when they ran from police in separate March 2021 pursuits, are not mentioned in the news release announcing the policy or the policy itself. But those pursuits — particularly that of Alvarez — cast a shadow over the policy.

Mayor Lori Lightfoot demanded that the department create an interim policy after the shootings and the county’s top prosecutor harshly criticized police about the Alvarez pursuit. It also appears that the police department took pains to prohibit just that kind of foot chase.

Under the policy, the chase of Alvarez would apparently not have been allowed for two key reasons. First, when police chased him for a traffic violation they knew who he was and where he lived, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx told reporters in March when she announced that the officers involved in the two shootings wouldn’t be charged. Second, officers are no longer allowed to chase on foot people who are suspected of the kind of minor offense that led to the chase.

The policy includes a number of circumstances in which an officer must call off a chase, including a requirement that the pursuit must end if a third party is injured and needs immediate medical attention that can’t be provided by anyone else. If officers realize they do not know exactly where they are, which is possible in a chaotic situation in which they are running through alleys and between houses, they must stop. And if they find themselves unable to communicate with other officers, whether because they drop their radios or for another reason, they must stop.

The policy also makes a point of reminding officers that they or their supervisors will not be criticized or disciplined for deciding against a foot pursuit or calling one off.

Officers are also prohibited from provoking chases, such as by employing a tactic in which they speed in their squad cars toward a group of people, stop suddenly and jump out “with the intention of stopping anyone in the group who flees.”

The city has been waiting for a policy since long before the shootings of Toledo and Alvarez.

Five years ago, the U.S. Department of Justice issued a scathing report saying that too many police chases in the city were unnecessary or ended with officers shooting people they did not have to shoot. And three years ago, a judge signed off on a consent decree that included a requirement to adopt a foot pursuit policy.

The city also had plenty of evidence about the dangers of foot pursuits, including a Chicago Tribune investigation that found that a third of the city’s police shootings from 2010 through 2015 involved someone being wounded or killed during a foot pursuit.

Police officials have denied any suggestion they have been dragging their feet, pointing out that the department has met the established deadlines.

But Chicago has not taken the lead on the issue, with other major cities such as Baltimore, Philadelphia and Portland, Oregon, already having implemented foot pursuit policies."

BRANDON BELL / Getty Images

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán called on conservatives in Europe and the U.S. to take back power from liberals, declaring a ""clash of civilizations"" is underway.

The far-right leader, who addressed the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Texas on Thursday, recently faced an international backlash over controversial remarks he made in late July, in which he said Hungarians ""do not want to become peoples of mixed race."" One former adviser, who has since resigned, referred to those comments as ""a pure Nazi speech worthy of Goebbels.""

Orbán, who came to power in 2010, has increasingly clamped down on political opposition and press freedom, consolidating his power further over the last two elections.

At CPAC, Orbán tried to preempt criticism, claiming ""a Christian politician cannot be racist"" and that those who consider him a racist or anti-Semite are ""simply idiots.""

""I can already see tomorrow's headlines,"" Orbán said. ""Far-right European racist and anti-Semite strongman, Trojan Horse of Putin, holds speech at conservative conference. But I don't want to give them any ideas, they know best how to write fake news.""

During his speech, Orbán also attacked Jewish billionaire George Soros, former President Barack Obama, ""globalists,"" and the Democratic Party: ""They hate me and slander me and my country, as they hate you.""

He also touted Hungary's aggressive illegal migration and anti-""gender ideology"" policies. At one point, Orbán read the Hungarian constitution's definition of marriage being between one man and one woman, prompting applause from the CPAC audience. ""Less drag queens and more Chuck Norris,"" he said.

A day before his appearance at CPAC, Orbán and his delegation met with former President Donald Trump at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Taylor Budowich, a spokesman for Mr. Trump's leadership PAC Save America, tweeted pictures of the meeting.

Hungarian Foreign Affairs Minister Péter Szijjártó also commented in a tweet that Hungarian-U.S. relations were ""at their peak when Donald Trump was President"" and expressed the hope that he'll be president again. .

With an eye toward the 2024 U.S. presidential race, Orbán called on conservatives to mobilize on both sides of the Atlantic to take back political power.

""We must take back the institutions in Washington and in Brussels. We must coordinate the movement of our troops, because we face the same challenge,"" he said. ""You have two years to get ready."""
LGBTQ book ban proponent faces felony child molestation charge in Missouri,https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/lgbtq-book-ban-advocate-faces-felony-child-molestation-charge-missouri-rcna14763,nottheonion,"A Missouri man who sought to ban several LGBTQ books from schools for depicting sexual content is now facing a felony charge of second-degree child molestation.

Ryan Utterback, a 29-year-old parent from a suburb of Kansas City, also faces a misdemeanor charge of fourth-degree domestic assault and, in a separate case, a misdemeanor of furnishing or attempting to furnish pornographic material to a minor.

Utterback had spoken at a school board meeting in November, as first reported by local news station KMBC-TV, an ABC affiliate, to advocate for the removal of books in North Kansas City Schools libraries that depicted sexual acts.

During another school board meeting in October, Utterback held up enlarged prints of two pages from the award-winning graphic memoir “Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic,” while a member of a parent association fighting for the ban spoke, arguing that handing the material to a child amounts to “solicitation of a minor.”

Accusations against Utterback, according to court documents, describe separate instances in 2020 in which he allegedly touched a 12-year-old girl under her clothes and rubbed a teenager’s leg underneath her jeans. Another case alleged in 2021 that he showed pornographic video footage to a child starting from when she was around 4 years old.

Utterback is next due in court on March 10. His attorney, David Bell, declined to comment on the record.

North Kansas City Schools declined to comment.

LGBTQ-inclusive books have long topped banned-book lists: Titles with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer themes comprised half of the 20 most challenged and banned books of the decade spanning 2010-19, according to the American Library Association. While challenges against LGBTQ content have historically been “constant,” according to Deborah Caldwell-Stone, the director of the ALA Office for Intellectual Freedom, she told NBC News in November that the association had seen a “chilling” uptick in the previous year.

“I’ve worked at ALA for two decades now, and I’ve never seen this volume of challenges come in,” Caldwell-Stone said at the time.

""Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic"" by Alison Bechdel. Mariner Books

Mary O’Hara, rapid response manager at the LGBTQ media advocacy group GLAAD, said in an email that challenged books in schools typically undergo an evaluation process by experts in literacy and education, who read them in their entirety to determine their academic and social merit. Many of these books then return to library shelves.

“Book ban advocates have long tried to inaccurately claim that LGBTQ representation in books, films, TV and ads is ‘unsuitable’ or ‘obscene,’ while other media with narratives and themes about opposite-sex relationships — even those with graphic sex or violence — are not targeted,” O’Hara said.

Those in favor of bans, including Utterback, have raised the issue of parental rights in choosing what to expose children to. The majority of the most recently targeted books feature LGBTQ- and race-inclusive storylines, O’Hara said.

“LGBTQ people and Black people are parents, too, and get a say in their children’s education,” they said, adding that schools should “ensure books are available to all children to learn about themselves and people different from themselves.”

Kansas City LGBTQ advocate Justice Horn, who was the first out Black student president at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, was present at the November school board meeting where Utterback spoke.

“The moral of this story is that book bans do not protect children,” Horn said of the allegations against Utterback. “Moreover, the people pushing book bans are not protecting children, and every lawmaker should take note.”

The “heroes” of the story, Horn said, are the North Kansas City students who spoke before the school board to fight against these bans.

“They are ensuring none of our stories are erased,” he continued. “We’ll be reading about them long after the people looking to ban books are out of the picture.”

A Kentucky man took his employer to court after they threw him a birthday party he didn't want, and the jurors sided with him.Now, his employer owes him $450,000.The verdict was handed down this week in Kenton County Circuit Court in Northern Kentucky. The plaintiff, an employee of Gravity Diagnostics, sued his employer after he was fired following a birthday party they threw for him in August.According to court documents, the employee had notified the office manager that birthday parties trigger his anxiety disorder, and that ""being the center of attention"" will cause him to have a panic attack. The employee asked the office manager days before his birthday in August to not arrange a birthday celebration as they did for other employees.Then on Aug. 7, the employee's birthday, the office arranged for a lunchtime birthday party in the lunch room, according to the lawsuit. The employee said that he found out about the party as he was headed to his lunch break, which triggered a panic attack.The incident caused the employee to ""leave the office suddenly and spend his lunch break in his car.""The employee sent a text message to the office manager, asking why she failed to accommodate his request to not have a party.The next day, the employee was called into a meeting, in which he said that he was ""confronted and criticized"" by the office manager about his reaction to the birthday party. That meeting then triggered another panic attack, and the employee asked the office manager to stop, according to the lawsuit.The employee was then sent home for the next two days, and that weekend, he was notified that he was being fired ""because of the events of the previous week.""The employee sued Gravity Diagnostics on the grounds of disability discrimination and retaliation. According to the lawsuit, the employee said because Gravity Diagnostics didn't accommodate his anxiety disorder, the birthday party and the events afterward caused him ""to suffer from a loss of income and benefits and emotional distress and mental anxiety.""The jury sided with the employee, agreeing that Gravity Diagnostics violated Kentucky law that protects workers who have a disability from ""adverse employment actions.""In total, the jury awarded the employee $450,000 in damages. Of that amount, $300,000 was for the emotional distress, while $150,000 was for lost wages."

Dating ads offering chance to meet 'lonely' Ukrainian women banned for being offensive,https://news.sky.com/story/dating-ads-offering-chance-to-meet-lonely-ukrainian-women-banned-for-being-offensive-12650970,nottheonion,"Dating adverts offering people the chance to meet ""lonely"" Ukrainian women have been banned for being offensive.

The three online ads for SofiaDate were seen in May after the government launched a scheme to encourage the public to house refugees fleeing the war in Ukraine.

The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said they connected the women's vulnerability to their sex appeal and caused serious offense.

First seen on the Dorset Echo's website, the advertisement featured an image of a woman on a balcony and the misspelled caption: ""Ukranian Women. Meet Thousands of Lonely Ukrainian Women. Forget About Loneliness. Let Yourself be Happy.""

Other versions of the ad were seen on The National's website, also spelling Ukrainian incorrectly and offering to connect ""singles across the world to their ideal partner"".

A total of three complaints were made to the ASA, saying the promotions were inappropriate and offensive considering the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Upholding the objections, the agency said the images of women featured in the ads were designed to titillate readers, with the models dressed in low-cut and tight clothing.

""We considered the ads' focus on Ukrainian women dressed in the aforementioned manner, as well references to their loneliness, had the effect of highlighting their vulnerability and connecting it to their sexual appeal,"" it said.

Astrasoft Projects, trading as SofiaDate, said it had removed the ads.

The National and Newsquest Media Group, trading as Dorset Echo, argued the ads did not refer to the war in Ukraine, were not partisan, and were also not unsympathetic towards Ukrainian women or the Ukrainian people in general.

However, it added that they were inconsistent with their policy of refusing ads for prostitution and trafficking, and they have been removed.

Molly-Mae Hague's Instagram post gets banned

Meanwhile, an Instagram post by the former Love Island star turned entrepreneur Molly-Mae Hague was banned by the ASA after she failed to show it was an advert.

The post, seen on Halloween, promoted a PrettyLittleThing dress with the caption: ""You can actually shop it now on PLT - Couldn't not make it available for you guys too,"" followed by a link to the retailer's website.

Ms Hague, who is the creative director of the clothing company, failed to include any reference to show the picture was an ad.

A social media user complained to the ASA that the post did not make its commercial intent clear.

This is the third time the influencer has been in trouble with the advertisement watchdog.

In March last year, she was warned about social media promotions, after an £8,000 online giveaway was found to have broken official rules.

In 2020, she had another post, showing an item of clothing from PrettyLittleThing, banned for not indicating it was an advert.

PrettyLittleThing confirmed that Ms Hague's contractual agreement expressly states the requirement for her to include the #ad disclosure in all uploads featuring the brand.

The firm understood that the disclosure had been omitted by mistake and had reminded Ms Hague of the requirement to prevent any similar mistakes in the future.

A spokeswoman for Ms Hague also said the #ad disclosure had been left off accidentally and confirmed it would be used in the future."

By India Today Web Desk: A 40-year-old woman from Gujarat’s Vadodara faced a shocking truth when she found out that the person she married in 2014 hid from her that he underwent a sex change operation to become a man.

According to a report by TOI, the woman filed a complaint at the Gotri Police on Wednesday and accused her husband, Viraj Vardhan, of cheating and unnatural sex. She also named his family members in the FIR.

She told the police that she met Viraj Vardhan, who had earlier identified as Vijaita, through a matrimonial site nine years ago. Her first husband died in a road accident in 2011 and left her with a 14-year-old daughter.

According to the police, they got married in February 2014 in the presence of family members and even went on a honeymoon to Kashmir. “However, the man didn't consummate the marriage and kept giving excuses for many days. When she pressured him, he claimed that an accident that he had suffered while in Russia some years ago rendered him incapable of having sex,” TOI quoted the police as saying.

The accused told the woman that he would be alright after a minor surgery.

In January 2020, he told her that he wanted to undergo surgery to reduce his weight and went to Kolkata for the procedure. However, he later revealed the truth and said he actually performed a sex-change surgery to implant male organs. The woman said he did not give her any details about the surgery.

She told the police that he started performing “unnatural sex” with her and also threatened her that she would face dire consequences if she talked about it to anyone.

Gotri police inspector, MK Gurjar said the accused, who is a resident of Delhi, has been brought to Vadodara.

Heat wave caused bees to ejaculate to death,https://www.squamishchief.com/highlights/heat-wave-caused-bees-to-ejaculate-to-death-could-styrofoam-protection-help-5103539,nottheonion,"B.C. farmer recalls 'incredible losses' following June 2021 heat wave. Then she went looking for a solution.

After drones mate with a queen, they always die after ejaculating. Why this happens when they die to heat stress is not clear.

1 / 1 After drones mate with a queen, they always die after ejaculating. Why this happens when they die to heat stress is not clear.

Bees can’t sweat. So when a record-breaking heat wave hit in late June 2021, drones fled their colonies in search of water — some descending on the burlap sack-covered kiddie pools dotting Emily Huxter’s Armstrong, B.C., farm.

At over 200 beats per second, the bees’ wings would have helped cool their tiny bodies as they desperately lugged water back to their colonies. Somewhere along the way, an untold number didn’t make it.

That morning, Huxter went out into her yard to check on her petite livestock. Dead drones everywhere, she remembers. In the grips of heat stress, their sex organs had exploded out of their bodies. The bees had ejaculated to death.

“It was unbelievable,” said Huxter, recounting the scene. “They have got all of their man parts out.”

Huxter called two beekeeping family members, who confirmed they were finding the same dead drones in awkward death poses.

Then she checked on roughly 300 starter hives where she rears queens, each worth hundreds of dollars. About 70 per cent were dead or missing.

“We had incredible losses. It was really scary,” she said. “Then we were like, ‘Oh my gosh, what's happening?’”

Emily Huxter found drones that had died during the heat wave had ejected their sex organs, ejaculating to death. Emily Huxter

Huxter called up University of British Columbia researcher Alison McAfee, who as a post-doctoral student at the BeeHIVE Research Centre, had run experiments on how bees respond to heat. At 40 degrees Celsius, McAfee explained, heat stress affects a bee's ability to mate; by 42 C, at least half of drones have been found to spontaneously ejaculate and die for some reason experts haven’t figured out.

Within weeks, climate scientists found the heat wave that scorched B.C. and the U.S. Pacific Northwest was made 150 times more likely due to climate change; by the 2040s, its record temperatures could return every five to 10 years.

Such extreme heat threatens more than bees or the honey they produce. The Armstrong bee farm is part of a network of beekeepers that provide pollination services for crops worth an estimated $5 billion a year in Canada.

Every year, Huxter drives her colonies across the Okanagan Valley, helping to pollinate cherry, apple and plum trees from near the U.S. border in Osoyoos up to Vernon.

A second-generation beekeeper, Huxter’s farm also rears queens for other beekeepers across Canada, helping to backfill the winter losses colonies experience every year in the Prairies or Ontario.

It’s all part of a push to make the industry more self-sufficient and wean Canadian beekeepers off queens imported from places like Australia or the United States.

Rising temperatures, said Huxter, is threatening that vision. So after the June losses, the beekeeper thought to herself, “How can we do things better?”

During the heat wave, desperation had driven Huxter to layer polystyrene (brand name Styrofoam) on top of the hive boxes. Other beekeepers she knew had tried adding sugar syrup to the hives, which would ostensibly evaporate and cool the colony.

“I thought, ‘Hmm, I wonder if that's a good idea or not?” Huxter told Glacier Media.

A month later, in the lead up to another heat wave, Huxter decided it was time to figure out what was the best way to protect her buzzing livestock. She reached out to McAfee to help design an experiment.

McAfee suggested running six starter hives with two-inch-thick pieces of polystyrene insulation on top to protect them from the sun. Huxter suggested giving another six hives a steady drip of sugar syrup. A third group got nothing.

Next, Huxter installed temperature loggers McAfee had sent her in each of the hives as well as one on a nearby solar panel to record ambient air temperature.

From July 28 to Aug. 9, they recorded temperatures in the hives every 10 minutes.

Over that 12-day period, the outside ambient temperatures climbed to 35.5 C. But inside the hives, internal temperatures ranged from 14.5 C to 41.5 C, with the highest temperatures found in the untreated hives.

When she went to analyze the data, McAfee found the syrup-fed hives reduced average daily high temperatures by 1.1 C, a difference she described as “not significant” in the beekeeper industry newsletter “Hivelights.”

The polystyrene cover, on the other hand, dropped average daily highs by 3.8 C, a “significant reduction.”

“It actually made the difference of having dangerous temperatures inside the hive to bringing it down below that threshold,” McAfee told Glacier Media.

Emily Huxter and Dr. Alison McAfee tested how hives covered in a Styrofoam sheet (back) and fed syrup (front) managed to regulate temperatures during hot summer weather. Emily Huxter

Since then, Huxter has redesigned all of her hives with two-inch polystyrene lids, a cheap and simple solution that helps the bees get through the winter too.

Both McAfee and Huxter doubt the insulation will be enough to protect bee colonies from the kind of extreme heat wave seen at the end of June.

“It’s one step towards getting better at managing the colonies under these extreme conditions that we should really only expect to increase in the future,” said McAfee.

Both women agree they need to keep experimenting, not least of all with alternative insulation materials that are more environmentally friendly.

“Maybe it's doing that trapped air, you know, like a wood-air-wood sandwich-type idea,” speculated Huxter, who is also looking to reach out to Australian beekeepers to understand how they adapt their colonies to extreme temperatures.

And while the sugar syrup didn’t show a large effect on the mini hives, it might still help the more mature colonies.

Dr. Alison McAfee holds a hive frame. Dominique Weiss

In some ways, water is going to matter more as temperatures climb: find the right distance to a lake or pond and bees can reach its waters to stay cool in the summer and get just enough of its cooling effect in the spring.

For now, Huxter is hoping Styrofoam and her network of kiddie pools will protect her young queens and drones across her farm’s 30 colony sites.

Over the last several decades, beekeeping has faced a number of challenges, from the arrival of pathogens and pests into Canadian colonies to poor nutrition.

“They have all these other problems. And climate change hasn't really been considered to be a major challenge for them in the past,” said McAfee.

That's because bees are good at staying warm. On Huxter’s farm, the colonies regularly raise internal hive temperatures from -20 C to 18 C to survive Armstrong’s frigid winters. But as increasingly hot and dry summers take hold, cooling down a colony is more difficult.

“They're not designed to do that as well,” said Huxter.

As a warming planet threatens food systems across the world, beekeepers like Huxter are looking to fight back with their own adaptations. Their success will be a crucial factor determining how much fresh food British Columbians see on their grocery store shelves.

“We're trying to transition in B.C. to being a self-sustaining industry,” she said. “And that's going to be really difficult as temperatures rise.”"
Queenslander with disability left to crawl off plane after Jetstar staff refuse to let her use transfer wheelchair without charge,https://7news.com.au/sunrise/queenslander-with-disability-left-to-crawl-off-plane-after-jetstar-staff-refuse-to-let-her-transfer-wheelchair-without-charge-c-8706749,nottheonion,"A Queensland woman with a disability has vowed to never fly Jetstar again after she ended up crawling off a plane when staff refused her request to use an aisle wheelchair for free.

During the last leg of her trip from Townsville to Bangkok, wheelchair user Natalie Curtis used an aisle wheelchair to help her get to her seat.

However, when it was time to depart the aircraft, Curtis says staff asked her to pay to use the wheelchair.

She refused, saying she had never been asked to pay before, and instead decided to crawl off the plane, a journey of about 4m.

Curtis admits there was a bit of a language barrier between her and staff.

“When we arrived (staff) were asking us to actually pay and I didn’t really comprehend it, and I’m like ‘no I’m not paying to be able to get off this plane’,” she told Sunrise.

“They all just sat around for a while and the option that was left was for me to get on the floor and crawl.”

Natasha Elford was travelling with Curtis and filmed her friend crawling down the aisle.

She said wanted to carry Curtis off the plane but could not, due to a knee injury.

“I just felt really sorry for Natalie ... I just felt really hopeless and I’m like, ‘I just can’t believe this is really happening’,” she said.

“(Staff) did obviously try to offer to lift her up and carry her, but if they dropped her (Curtis) that would (have been) 10 times worse.”

It’s understood Jetstar staff were informed that an aisle wheelchair was not available for at least 40 minutes when the plane arrived in Bangkok. Curtis’ own wheelchair was brought onto the plane but it was too big to fit down the aisle.

In a statement from Jetstar, a spokesperson denied the aisle wheelchair was withheld due to a request for payment.

“We unreservedly apologise to Ms Curtis for her recent experience while travelling with us,” the spokesperson said.

“We are committed to providing a safe and comfortable travel experience for all our customers, including those requiring specific assistance.

“Regrettably, this was not the case for Ms Curtis following a miscommunication that resulted in the delay of an aisle chair being made available at the gate on arrival and we are looking into what happened as a matter of urgency.”

Jetstar said it has offered Curtis a refund and additional compensation.

Curtis is adamant she will never fly with Jetstar again, describing the whole situation as “embarrassing”.

“It was extremely humiliating so I definitely don’t want anyone else to go through what I had to go through.”"

LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- A woman has filed a lawsuit against the Los Angeles Police Department and Airport Police, claiming she was jailed for 13 days before police realized they had the wrong woman in custody.

Bethany K. Farber's ordeal began last April when she was on her way to Mexico to visit family. She said Transportation Security Administration officials told her there was a warrant out for her arrest in Texas.

""I asked them repeatedly to double check and they completely blew me off,"" Farber said. ""They said, 'Nope, Bethany Farber, we have you.'""

According to her legal team, TSA turned Farber over to LAX police, who then turned her over to LAPD and took her to the 77th Street station for booking.

""Now what's interesting, at the time Miss Farber is booked, the police do nothing to confirm whether or not this Bethany Farber is that Bethany Farber,"" Farber's attorney Rodney Diggs said. ""This Bethany Farber, from what we understand, has an extensive criminal history. Her fingerprints are in the data base.""

Farber's family hired lawyers in Texas and Southern California to work on her release. She was held for nearly two weeks at the Lynwood women's jail without bail.

Farber's family said after sending phone records and a photo to law enforcement and the district attorney handling the case in Texas, they received a response from the prosecutor.

""She said, 'Oh my God, we are so sorry, we will expedite this. We will get her out,'"" Farber's mother Terry Brodie said.

On April 28, 2021, Farber was released from jail. She said the ordeal caused her ailing grandmother to suffer a stroke that led to her death.

When asked for a statement, LAPD and LAX police told ABC7 they do not comment on pending litigation. Farber's legal team said they're open to a discussion on settling the case."
"Roland Emmerich Claims Film Industry is ruined because ""nothing is original anymore.""",https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/roland-emmerich-marvel-star-wars-ruining-our-industry/,nottheonion,"Says Emmerich, “There were [The Adventures of Tintin comics], but they were very childish and there were no superheroes. So that’s why at the very beginning, superheroes didn’t work in Germany. They needed 10 or 15 years [of movies] to get to the same level as the rest of the world…. But I just have never found any interest in that kind of movie.”

However, Emmerich’s larger point about superhero movies, as well as Star Wars, harming the industry is a new one for the filmmaker, pulling from the popular argument that the repetitious and constant deluge of films all based on the same intellectual property—Marvel has reached the point where they are releasing four movies a year, not including Disney+ series—has conditioned audiences to primarily favor films and formulaic storylines that they’re already familiar with at the expense of everything else. For instance, Jodie Foster said in 2018 superhero movies are like fracking where “[shareholders] get the best return right now but you wreck the earth…. ruining the viewing habits of the American population and the rest of the world.”

And after the fall 2021 movie season, the fruits of that argument are difficult to dismiss when Spider-Man: No Way Home can gross $1.7 billion (and counting), becoming the sixth highest grossing movie of all time during the pandemic, while original films from beloved directors like Steven Spielberg with West Side Story or Ridley Scott in his ancient period piece sweet spot via The Last Duel can infamously flop.

Emmerich including Star Wars is also interesting since he’s previously said George Lucas’ original 1977 movie was one of the key inspirations that led him to become a director. You can see its influence on the many sci-fi dogfight sequences in Independence Day, for example. But now, he admits, unless you’re making a film based on an IP as popular and saturated as Star Wars has become in the last seven years, it’s difficult to get financing for an original project—even a disaster movie like Moonfall from the director of ID4 and The Day After Tomorrow.

“You should make bold new movies, you know?” Emmerich tells us. “And I think, actually, Christopher Nolan is the master of that. He is someone who can make movies about whatever he wants. I have it a little bit harder, but I still have a big enough name—especially when it’s a disaster [movie] or has some sort of disaster theme.”

It’s how Emmerich got the funding for an original idea he had for Moonfall: What if the moon was not a natural object but a “megastructure,” as some conspiracy theorists happily suggest? And what if that megastructure actually started to fall to the Earth? It’s a concept Emmerich’s been trying to get off the ground for years, and it finally arrives in theaters later this week. We’ll have more on that film, and our full interview with the director, in the next few days."
"Rochester woman fights to get back $8K seized in raid; she was not charged, no drugs found",https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2022/04/06/rochester-woman-fighting-get-back-money-seized-raid-civil-forfeiture/9482057002/#l1nt9uiacop3500nzv7,nottheonion,"In October 2020, Rochester police raided the West Main Street apartment of Cristal Starling and her then-boyfriend, who was suspected of dealing drugs.

No drugs were found, but police seized $8,040 in currency that Starling says was hers. Her boyfriend was arrested based on drugs found at another home, but he was later acquitted of the charges.

Starling has been trying to get her money back since the acquittal. She's still trying.

The nonprofit Institute for Justice, a public interest law firm, plans an appeal to a federal court, seeking to reverse a judge's decision that federal and local police can keep Starling's money. Starling's case, Institute attorneys say, is typical of many forfeiture cases in the country: The money is not an overwhelming amount and the administrative process so convoluted that people who lose their money simply give up.

""This is very common where it’s a small amount of money,"" said Institute attorney Seth Young. ""You don’t hire a lawyer and the maze of forfeiture procedures trips up a person who represents themselves and the person ends up losing their money.""

Starling tried, without the aid of a lawyer, to chase down her seized money. She also lost use of two cars, which were also taken then later returned. She had to pay for a rental car during those weeks, she said.

Starling said that the money was rightfully hers to begin with, but she felt sure the acquittal of her ex-boyfriend would trigger the return of the $8,040.

""After trial I tried to get my money back,"" she said. ""They sent me through this whole process of trying to get it through the courts and I still did not get it.""

Court papers show that federal prosecutors maintained that Starling missed deadlines for the administrative filing of claims for the return of the seized money, and that her claim was first made three months after a default awarded the money to the government. Starling said she was on vacation, and records supported this claim, at a time when the government said it gave ""direct notice.""

A federal judge upheld the decision by authorities to keep Starling's money, which is typically then divided among police agencies.

The federal appellate court for New York often supports decisions such as that made to affirm the seizure, according to Institute for Justice lawyers. The attorneys had been trying to find a case worthy of appeal, but that hunt was difficult because many people don't challenge the seizure to the extent of Starling, who filed claims and legal action.

""This is sort of the typical case,"" said Institute attorney Rob Johnson. ""Cristal got farther in the fight than virtually anyone, which is why I was able to find her.""

Oftentimes, the attorneys said, federal prosecutors offer a return of half of the money, and Starling said that happened with her case, even after the default decision allowed authorities to keep all of the funds.

""My question to them was if I had already lost all rights to the full amount of currency .. and it's already in default, why would you be offering half of it back,"" Starling said.

The U.S. Attorney's Office declined comment Wednesday,

The Institute has forfeiture data for 21 states, and the median currency forfeiture is $1,276 — making most people unwilling to pay for a lawyer, Institute lawyers say.

If local or state police use the federal forfeiture process, by turning over currency or property to federal law enforcement, the local or state agencies can see an 80% return. Some states, including New York, have laws that provide fewer obstacles to people seeking the return of seized money or property, Institute lawyers say.

Should the appeal be successful, Starling's bid to get her money back would return to federal court in Rochester for reconsideration. There, Institute lawyers say, she could argue why she should get the money, and not, instead, be waylaid by administrative deadlines.

""The system is extremely complex and confusing,"" said Institute lawyer Young. ""It's really hard to navigate even for lawyers. ... They get tripped up by the procedures and they miss a deadline in these super strict rules.

""Oftentimes the merits of these cases are never heard,"" he said.

Starling said her reasons for seeing her money returned are simple.

""I wasn't charged with anything,"" she said.

"Driver arrested with severed head in vehicle was just unlucky car thief, his lawyer says",https://www.dailybreeze.com/2022/01/07/driver-arrested-with-severed-head-in-vehicle-was-just-unlucky-car-thief-his-lawyer-said/,nottheonion,"A driver who was arrested after Las Vegas police found a severed head and other body parts in his pickup truck was just an unlucky thief who stole the wrong vehicle, his lawyer says.

However, prosecutors say Eric Holland, 57, killed the man who was found dismembered in the truck.

A hearing Tuesday determined he would be charged with murder and held without bail.

The events that led to Holland’s arrest began with an attempted traffic stop on the afternoon of Dec. 23 on Tropicana Avenue in the Spring Valley neighborhood. A Las Vegas Metropolitan police officer pulled over a Toyota Tundra truck after a license check showed its registration was suspended. The driver initially stopped but then drove away, the police report said.

Officers followed the truck for about three miles and saw it go into a parking garage next to the Rio hotel & casino. A short time later, another truck, a Chevrolet Avalanche, came out of the garage.

Believing it was the same driver, the police followed the Chevy truck for two more miles, until it stopped at an apartment complex near the Orleans casino.

There Holland got out and repeatedly ignored commands given by police, according to court documents. When he attempted to flee, he was stunned with a taser and detained, police said.

Once Holland was in custody, police found that both trucks had been reported stolen — the Chevrolet from California’s Santa Clara County.

While searching the Chevy, police found a black plastic trash bag emitting “a foul odor.” It had a severed head inside, according to the complaint. Coolers allegedly contained “two human legs” and “an apparent human torso.”

The Clark County coroner’s office identified the victim as Richard P. Miller, 65, of Las Vegas. The coroner’s office ruled the death a homicide due to multiple gunshot wounds.

An attorney for Holland, P. David Westbrook, said that his client had stolen the truck from the garage near the Rio without knowing what was in it. He pointed out that the truck bed was covered and the coolers sealed.

“In order to presume that Mr. Holland had prior knowledge of the contents of this truck, you would also have to believe that he lead police to the body intentionally,” Westbrook said. “The question is: why would he do this?”

Prosecutors contend that Miller was an acquaintance of Holland’s and that Holland had been caught on video in a Home Depot buying a saw and plastic bags, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.

Care homes in England ‘risk being vilified’ if forced to allow visitors,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/nov/12/care-homes-in-england-may-be-vilified-if-forced-to-allow-visitors-sector-warns,nottheonion,"Care homes face being “vilified” if they are forced to allow in visitors under new plans being considered by the government, ministers have been told.

The care minister Helen Whately said stopping relatives from visiting loved ones in care homes as a precaution against the spread of Covid-19 showed “a lack of humanity”. Legislation is being planned to give care home residents and hospital patients the legal right to see guests, according to the Times, prompting fury from the care sector.

Nadra Ahmed, the chair of the National Care Association, said she was “really disappointed” and blamed staff shortages and a lack of funding for not being able to allow all visitors.

“I think it’s really disappointing that we’re looking at another piece of legislation in relation to the care home sector,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “And I think it will be really important for people to understand that we’re probably one of the most legislated against parts of the sector.”

She added: “We’re trying to do the very, very best that we can and to be vilified in this way when we’re trying our very best. The government needs to be concentrating … on funding the sector properly so that we can do everything we possibly can.”

While official visiting restrictions in England have been lifted, some care homes and hospitals are refusing to allow visitors or are imposing stringent Covid-19 conditions. One care home has even stopped phone calls between residents and loved ones for fear that handsets could get infected.

Nicci Gerrard, the co-founder of the John’s Campaign charity, said those with special needs such as dementia should have the right to be accompanied by their essential caregiver “wherever they go”.

She told the Today programme: “There are lots of complicated things around the edges, but at the centre there’s this clear message that people should not be separated from those that they love during times of their greatest need.

“And Covid has shown why that needs to be enshrined in law. It’s very easy to sweep away these human rights.”

Whately told of her own frustration at the current restrictions imposed on some care home residents.

“The darkest days of the pandemic are thankfully behind us but I’m still hearing from families [who are] being stopped from visiting loved ones,” she said.

“I know how it feels. I didn’t know if I would see my mum alive again when she was very ill in hospital in the summer. I remember well the feelings I had at the time – grief mixed with frustration and even anger at a system that seemed to lack humanity.”

It is not yet clear how the government plans to bring in new laws, but it could take the form of secondary legislation forcing the Care Quality Commission to inspect visiting policies when rating care homes or hospitals.

A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: “Our guidance clearly states that residents in care homes should be able to have at least one visitor in all situations. We urge all trusts and care homes to follow the guidance and ensure they are facilitating these visits, which play a crucial role in the wellbeing and care of patients and residents.”"

A senior Russian diplomat has said a ceasefire is not a good option at the moment, because it will give Ukrainian forces the chance to ""regroup and to stage more provocations"".

Earlier today, Russia announced that it would be holding a ceasefire around the steelworks in the besieged city of Mariupol from 14:00 local time (11:00 GMT), to allow civilians to leave.

But Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said no agreement had been reached and called for written security guarantees.

Russia's first deputy permanent representative to the UN, Dmitry Polyanskiy, said Ukraine had claimed that there were some civilians in the Azovstal steel plant, where the last Ukrainian fighters in the city are holed up, but Ukrainian forces ""did not let them go"".

He went on to say that Russia had not attacked residential areas in Odesa, Ukraine's Black Sea port city, over the weekend.

On Saturday, Ukraine said that two missiles struck a military facility and two residential buildings in the city. But Polyanskiy said the residential buildings were hit by Ukraine air defences.

He went on to reject the comments made by US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, who said Russia had failed to achieve its aims in the invasion.

Polyanskiy said: ""I don't think we failed, frankly."" He added that Russia is conducting its ""military operation"" and it has ""its own aims"" and ""its own strategies""."

Steven Tyler Thinks All Metallica Songs Sound the Same,https://www.wearethepit.com/2022/12/steven-tyler-thinks-all-metallica-songs-sound-the-same/,nottheonion,"There’s nothing wrong with having one sound and sticking with it.

In his autobiography Does the Noise In My Head Bother You, Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler got on the defensive about always changing up the Aerosmith formula. Even though he maintained that Aerosmith liked to reach for new sounds on every record, he also felt the need to drag Metallica through the mud saying,

“You can’t put your finger on what we do, because we do a lot of different kinds of music, unlike Metallica, which does only one genre. Have you ever heard a slow Metallica song? Is there one that you could dance to at prom? If you asked them, they’d go ‘Why would we?’”

Then again, Metallica does have its fair share of slow songs like ‘Nothing Else Matters’ and ‘Until it Sleeps.’ And let’s not forget the Load and St. Anger, both of which went in new directions that most of us weren’t ready for.

If you actually asked the guys in Metallica, the band has always made it a point to innovate on every album.

Around the time that the band were working on S&M, Lars Ulrich seemed to be happy about changing their sound saying, (45:24)

“Nowadays it’s just about doing it…the creative process. You don’t think about success or sales or any of that stuff. I was really preoccupied with that stuff.

“It’s just about coexisting as a band and have the freedom to make albums with classical orchestras and make records full of cover songs. That’s the core of a successful rock band. Just listening to your instincts and your heart.”

Steven is a legend in his own right, but he might be a little out of his depth throwing Metallica under the bus. Do you think Steven Tyler has a point? Let us know on Instagram.

New York declares disaster emergency after polio detected in several counties,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/sep/09/new-york-polio-state-of-emergency,nottheonion,"New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, declared a disaster emergency on Friday and said the state was stepping up its polio-fighting efforts after the virus was detected in the wastewater of yet another county in the New York City area.

Health officials began checking for signs of the virus in sewage water after the first case of polio in the US in nearly a decade was identified in July in Rockland county, close to the city.

The latest detection involved a wastewater sample collected last month in Nassau county on Long Island.

The sample is genetically linked to the polio case from Rockland and provides further evidence of expanding community spread, state health officials said.

The polio virus had previously been detected in wastewater in New York City and three counties to its north: Rockland, Orange and Sullivan.

Hochul declared a state disaster emergency that allows Emergency Medical Service (EMS) workers, midwives and pharmacists to administer polio vaccines and allows doctors to issue standing orders for the vaccine.

Data on immunizations will be used to focus vaccination efforts where they are needed the most.

“On polio, we simply cannot roll the dice,” the state health commissioner, Mary Bassett, said. “If you or your child are unvaccinated or not up to date with vaccinations, the risk of paralytic disease is real. I urge New Yorkers to not accept any risk at all.”’

The statewide polio vaccination rate is 79%, but the counties of Rockland, Orange and Sullivan had lower rates.

Officials have said that it is possible that hundreds of people in the state have gotten polio and don’t know it. Most people infected with polio have no symptoms but can still give the virus to others for days or weeks.

The lone confirmed case in New York involved an unidentified adult who was unvaccinated."

After more than 17 years in the making, it finally opened October 25, 2019. Then came the coronoavirus pandemic.

The American Dream megamall in New Jersey, crippled by construction delays and stalled store openings, is running out of money.

The more than 3-million-square-foot retail and entertainment complex nearly emptied a reserve account to make a $9.3 million payment that was due Tuesday, on about $290 million of debt supported by sales tax receipts, according to a securities filing.

About $820 is left in the reserve fund, the filing said. And it's unclear whether or not the developers will be able to make their next payment, which is due on Aug. 1.

American Dream spokeswoman Melissa Howard said developers Triple Five Group are ""extremely pleased"" with the early success of tenants. This year, American Dream will open more than 100 retail, entertainment and restaurant concepts, she said, including a two-story Gucci flagship.

The filing also included a letter from bond servicer Trimont Real Estate Advisors, which said American Dream wasn't offering updates on project expenses and performance, as it is obliged to do under bond documents.

""While everyone appreciates the difficulties posed by the pandemic, and the likelihood that grant revenue received now may not be sufficient to fully pay the bonds, that does not relieve the developer from responsibility to comply with its obligations under the various agreements,"" Trimont said in the letter, dated Jan. 18."

Alabama omits Civil War president Abraham Lincoln in Presidents Day holiday,https://www.al.com/news/2022/02/alabama-omits-civil-war-president-abraham-lincoln-in-presidents-day-holiday.html?outputType=amp,nottheonion,"Presidents Day is a time to celebrate U.S. leaders past and present. The exact details of the holiday vary from state to state, however, and in Alabama, one of the most commonly honored presidents – one who led the country through some of its darkest days- is omitted.

The Presidents Day holiday traces its roots to 1800 when it was set aside to honor George Washington, the nation’s first leader who had died the year before. It was originally celebrated on Feb. 22, the day of Washington’s actual birth. It remained an unofficial holiday until the late 1870s when it became an official federal commemoration. It was originally celebrated only in the District of Columbia but, in 1885, was expanded to the entire country.

In 1971, the Washington holiday was moved to the third Monday in February as part of what’s known as the Uniform Monday Holiday Act, a change that allowed workers to have more three-day weekends. Congress also included a provision that specifically included Abraham Lincoln, who was born on Feb. 12 and the Washington/Lincoln combo is the most recognized one for Presidents Day.

Alabama’s unique twist

Alabama’s take on Presidents Day is unique.

Alabama calls President’s Day “George Washington/Thomas Jefferson Day.” Jefferson, the third U.S. president, was born in Virginia in April. The state holiday omits Lincoln, who led the Union against the Confederacy made up of Alabama and other Southern states during the Civil War.

Other states do have variations of the holiday, including Arkansas which celebrates “George Washington and Daisy Gatson Bates Day,” to honor the first president and the civil rights activists who played a central role in the integration of Little Rock’s Center High School in 1957. South Carolina celebrates Washington’s Birthday/Presidents Day; Mississippi, Georgia and Virginia commemorate George Washington Day; and Texas and Tennessee have Presidents Day."

Sanjeev Prasad Sinha, 62, a pensioner, and his wife Sadhana Prasad Sinha say they exhausted their life savings on their son, including on a $65,000 pilot training course and his wedding six years ago at a five-star hotel, with a honeymoon in Thailand.

The couple, from Haridwar in India's Uttarakhand state, said that all they asked of their son Sagar Sinha, 35, and his wife Shubhangi Sinha, 31, was to give them a grandchild, which they had failed to do.

“We killed our dreams to raise him,"" the couple said in their petition. ""We even took a loan of 2m rupees for his education.

""But despite all our efforts, my son and his wife have caused mental torture by not giving us a grandchild. The society also questions us, causing further pain.""

Their lawyer, Arvind Kumar Srivastava, said the Sinhas spent about 25m rupees on their son since birth. Now they want repayment of that expenditure, and an additional 25m rupees as damages.

“They have demanded the money because of mental cruelty,” Mr Srivastava told The National. ""It is a dream of every parent to become a grandparent. They had been waiting for years to become grandparents.

“They had been trying to convince the son and his wife but they paid no heed to their demands. They are heartbroken that they will die without seeing their grandchild.""

Mr Srivastava said the couple filed a plea last Saturday and the case will be taken up for hearing by the court in Dehradun city on May 15.

India is a largely conservative society, with parents traditionally having a major say in the matrimonial and professional life of their children. Refusal to comply with expectations regarding marriage and profession is seen as disrespectful to parents."
Is 'rainbow fentanyl' a threat to your kids this Halloween? Experts say no,https://www.npr.org/2022/10/11/1127168627/is-rainbow-fentanyl-a-threat-to-your-kids-this-halloween-experts-say-no,nottheonion,"Is 'rainbow fentanyl' a threat to your kids this Halloween? Experts say no

Enlarge this image toggle caption Drug Enforcement Administration Drug Enforcement Administration



The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has been raising a terrifying alarm in recent weeks. According to the DEA, bright-colored fentanyl pills designed to hook children have been spotted in nearly two dozen states.

The DEA says they identified a deliberate new marketing scheme by Mexican cartels and street dealers who want the pills to ""look like candy to children and young people.""

""It looks like candy,"" DEA Administrator Anne Milgram told NBC News. ""In fact, some of the drug traffickers have nicknamed it Sweet Tarts, Skittles.""



The DEA alert didn't mention Halloween, but fears about ""rainbow"" fentanyl and the holiday went viral.

In an interview on Fox News, Milgram was asked whether parents should worry about candy gathered by kids trick-or-treating.

""We have not seen any connection to Halloween,"" Milgram said.

DEA warning meets skepticism from drug experts

Drug policy experts contacted by NPR agree there's no new fentanyl threat this Halloween. Many are also skeptical of the DEA's original warning. They don't believe Mexican drug cartels and street dealers have launched any new campaign targeting children.

""I don't see any evidence that the DEA has produced that supports that conjecture,"" said Nabarun Dasgupta, a researcher studying illegal drugs at the University of North Carolina.

Dasgupta's lab tests illegally manufactured opioid pills collected from across the United States. He says colored pills like the ones highlighted in the DEA warning are on the streets but that it's nothing new.

""We get them almost on a daily basis,"" he said. ""We see pinks and purples, yellow, green, red, aqua, fuchsia. It's a pretty wide palette. Blue is the predominant color, but it's not surprising to see any of those.""

Indeed, street drug experts contacted by NPR say traffickers have long used bright colors in their products for reasons that have nothing to do with children.

Dr. Sheila Vakharia, head of research for an addiction think-tank called the Drug Policy Alliance, said dealers use colors, stamps and other markers ""to distinguish their product from other products on the street.""

Warnings about sidewalk chalk and toy boxes

In its warning about dealers marketing fentanyl to young people, the DEA also suggested cartels are coloring blocks of the drug so that it ""resembles sidewalk chalk.""

The DEA also issued an alert about bright-colored fentanyl smuggled in a box of LEGO toys that included a statement from New York City Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell.

""Disguising fentanyl as candy — and concealing it in children's toys — will never hide the fact that fentanyl is a deadly poison that harms our communities, our families, and our city,"" Sewell said.

But the DEA alert acknowledges the pills appear to have been concealed in the toy box not to attract young people, but as a smuggling tactic meant ""to deter law enforcement attention.""

Why would dealers market fentanyl to young children?

Drug experts contacted by NPR also questioned whether traffickers, who are driven by profit, would focus on kids.

They said selling fentanyl pills deliberately to children would be incredibly risky. The drug is potent and deadly, and the legal penalties for dealing drugs to kids are severe.

They also noted that selling to really young kids — who might be drawn to pills that look like candy or sidewalk chalk — would be bad for business.

Young children typically lack access to the kind of cash that makes for good repeat customers.

Vakharia believes the real public health concern is dealers shaping and coloring pills to look like fentanyl-free opioids from a pharmacy. ""Oftentimes colors are also used to mimic legitimate prescription medications,"" she said.

NPR sent a list of questions to the DEA, asking for an interview or for more detailed evidence to support the claim drug dealers are actively using candy-like fentanyl to hook children.

On background, DEA officials said their investigations show traffickers are targeting young people in part by using social media, but they declined to offer specifics.

""College, high school, and even middle school-aged kids might encounter illegal drug sales online,"" according to the statement.

""New drug trends, like fake pills and brightly colored fentanyl, are marketing tactics used to appeal to various customers.""

A real crisis and concern about false alarms

Everyone contacted for this story agrees fentanyl is a danger. Overdoses hit record levels in the United States last year, with a significant rise in deaths among people age 15 to 34.

NPR could find no evidence linking those deaths to ""rainbow"" fentanyl.

Brandon del Pozo, an addiction medicine researcher at Brown University, says fears about the very real fentanyl crisis have sometimes given rise to inaccurate information and false alarms.

""Fentanyl's a very potent drug that's causing a lot of overdose death but it's taken on a mythical life of its own,"" he said.

Del Pozo, who worked as a police officer in New York and Vermont, says in some instances drug scares that aren't based on good science are shared by law enforcement.

He points to the belief among some first responders that they can suffer overdoses or other serious health effects by touching fentanyl powder or accidentally inhaling small amounts of the substance.

""There's just no evidence,"" del Pozo said. ""There's never been a toxicologically confirmed case of that happening with police.""

According to del Pozo, false alarms and drug scares matter because they distract attention from the need for better health care and addiction treatment at a moment when more than 100,000 Americans are dying from overdoses each year.

""We're forgoing good solid basic public health and safety information that could be used to reverse overdoses, link people to treatment and save lives,"" he said.

Again, there's no evidence of any heightened risk from fentanyl linked to Halloween. The Food and Drug Administration does offer a list of safety tips every October.

The FDA recommends kids only accept candy that is commercially wrapped, advising parents to examine sweets for any signs of tampering."
China's 'Twitter' appears to have blocked searches for a line from the country's national anthem that tells people to 'stand up' and 'refuse to be slaves',https://www.insider.com/shanghai-lockdown-anger-china-weibo-censors-lyrics-national-anthem-slaves-2022-4,nottheonion,"The Chinese national anthem kicks off with the line: ""Stand up! Those who refuse to be slaves!""

Searches for a hashtag referencing the line appear to have been blocked on China's Twitter-like Weibo.

The move comes amid increasing fury over how Shanghai authorities have handled the city's COVID-19 lockdown.

The first line of the Chinese national anthem is a rousing call that reads: ""Stand up! Those who refuse to be slaves!""

Now, it appears that the line has been barred on China's Twitter-like Weibo platform, amid increasing outrage and frustration over the authorities' handling of Shanghai's harsh COVID-19 lockdown.

Searches on the platform for a hashtag referencing the lyrics appear to have been blocked over the weekend, with users receiving the message ""no results can be found"" when they attempt to do so.

It is unclear when the blocking of searches began, but a Weibo user's post in reference to it began circulating on Sunday night. Since then, the post has received more than 11,000 likes and close to 3,000 reposts.

""How do you sing the first line of the national anthem?"" the user wrote, drawing reactions of laughter and surprise from other users.

""Even the national anthem has been censored. Does that mean that China will also have to change its name soon?"" one person commented. Many other users shared the post along with the hashtag ""Shanghai"" or news reports about Shanghai's Covid situation.

Some users also modified the anthem's lyrics, with one commenting: ""Stand up! Those slaves who are hungry and cold.""

The apparent censorship comes as residents in Shanghai, a financial hub of 26 million residents, have been placed under a strict and indefinite lockdown amid a surge of COVID-19 cases since late March. With residents barred from leaving their homes to buy essential items, people across the city have said they are running out of food.

Last week, Weibo appeared to have also censored content about food shortages after hungry residents went online to vent their frustrations about obtaining groceries.

There has also been widespread anger after Shanghai officials began separating Covid-positive babies and children from their parents earlier this month, although the controversial practice has since been eased.

Despite the public's reaction, Chinese health officials have stood by their country's ""dynamic"" ""zero-Covid"" policy, which entails rapid lockdowns, mass testing, and travel restrictions whenever clusters of cases emerge.

According to the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission, the city reported 2,417 symptomatic Covid cases and 19,831 asymptomatic cases on Sunday.

Weibo did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment."
"San Rafael homeless camper sues city, Caltrans over noise, alleging that exposure to freeway noise and pollution has led to hearing loss",https://www.marinij.com/2022/04/03/san-rafael-homeless-camper-sues-city-caltrans-over-noise/,nottheonion,"A resident of the city-sanctioned homeless camp under Highway 101 in San Rafael is suing the city and Caltrans alleging that exposure to freeway noise and pollution has led to hearing loss and risk of illness.

The class-action lawsuit cites statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which states the World Health Organization recommends that noise exposure levels should not exceed 70 decibels over a 24-hour period and 85 decibels over a one-hour period to avoid hearing impairment. The CDC also says the Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends workers should use hearing protection when exposed to 90 decibels or higher during an eight-hour work day.

The suit cites a CDC report that links living in proximity to a major road or highway with health effects such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respiratory symptoms and other diseases.

The plaintiff, James Hellard, 49, alleges that the city has been “forcing” him to live under the overpass for the past two years because “living anywhere else means my survival gear will be confiscated.”

Using a sound meter app on his cellphone, he recorded vehicle noise from the highway above measuring at 90 decibels and higher, the suit says.

“I am currently suffering permanent hearing loss and am inhaling dangerous amounts of freeway related gasoline exhaust due to defendants willful and wanton disregard for my welfare,” the suit says.

Hellard seeks monetary relief for physical and emotional damages and property loss, as well as the ability to camp elsewhere without risk of having his belongings confiscated, according to the suit. The suit also asks that campers receive adequate hygiene amenities, earplugs and N-95 masks, among other provisions.

In an interview, Hellard said his ears ring because of the freeway noise and that he has noticed that a film that covers the surfaces of the camp area, and he believes it to be from exhaust. He complained of pests, including rats, and said there is no running water and the handwashing stations provided are not refilled with water and soap often enough.

“Our lives are at risk,” he said.

Robbie Powelson, a homeless activist assisting Hellard and other residents, described the site as an “internment camp” and accused officials of negligence and false imprisonment.

“The legal community needs rise up to represent victims so they can receive just compensation and hold their persecutors accountable in a class-action lawsuit,” Powelson said.

Hellard filed the petition for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on Tuesday. A hearing has been set for April 22.

Cheryl Chambers, deputy district director of external affairs for Caltrans, declined to comment.

The suit also names San Rafael police mental health liaison Lynn Murphy and police Sgt. Carl Huber. Requests for comment were forwarded to San Rafael police Lt. Dan Fink, who said the city does not comment on pending litigation.

However, Fink said the city collaborated with stakeholders to ensure the homeless campers had access to the services they need.

Camps of homeless people have become entrenched in a number of Bay Area cities, including Novato and Sausalito, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Federal health guidelines advise against clearing camps, and in some instances courts intervened to bar jurisdictions from doing so. Novato and Sausalito both remain under court orders not to shut down their camps.

In June, the San Rafael City Council approved a $260,000 allocation to work with Marin County to hire more case workers to aid homeless people.

The city-sanctioned camp was established in July on Caltrans property at the freeway viaduct. The area was set up to provide security, restrooms, handwashing stations, garbage disposal, regular service referrals and other amenities, according to the city. At that time, homeless campers in other areas were relocated to the site, which he city calls a “service support area.”

In a July interview with the Independent Journal about the city camp, Murphy said, “Nobody was forced, this was all done by choice. Most people were very eager to get into the site.”

The City Council also voted unanimously that month to ban camping in Boyd Park and in city garages due to fire risk.

Last month, the state announced it will grant $522,000 to San Rafael for expenses related its camp. The county also planned to provide $166,000 to San Rafael through a matching funds program. The funding was said to cover 24-hour security and another case worker.

The city has spent $346,852 to staff and outfit the camp, Fink said. Thirty-one people live there, he said.

The campers are provided with case managers, a catered meal weekly, spiritual advisers, a mobile medical clinic, COVID-19 vaccinations and testing, animal care for those with pets, job opportunities through the Downtown Streets Team, library services and visits with Spahr Center staff, who offer LGBTQ+ support services.

The police department does not assign officers to the camp and officers only respond to calls for service, Fink said.

“We’re very proud of the support that we’re able to provide at the services support area for the individuals in need,” Fink said. “We’ll always continue to work individuals experiencing homelessness so that we can help provide them with any resources and options that they need through our city partners.”"
"SF couple gets $1,500 fine for parking in their driveway despite doing so for nearly 40 years",https://abc7news.com/san-francisco-parking-violations-driveway-carport/12009975/,nottheonion,"The couple were told parking in front of their house was illegal, despite the fact they'd been parking there for nearly 40 years.

SF couple gets $1,500 fine for parking in their driveway despite doing so for nearly 40 years

SAN FRANCISCO (KGO) -- It seemed so unfair. They'd been using their carpad for decades - when suddenly the city said it's illegal. Not only that, they were threatened with a $1,500 fine - a huge penalty even for San Francisco. The only way out? Go back into San Francisco history.

UPDATE: How an Army aerial photo expert helped SF couple park in driveway again after threat of $1.5K fine

Parking in San Francisco is a difficult part of life here. You find a spot... but get a ticket anyway.

For Judy and Ed Craine it seems especially unfair.

""We always use the carport,"" said Judy.

""Parked in that driveway every day and every night,"" confirmed Ed.

They live on a steep hill where parking can be a gravity-defying challenge.

But they could slip into their driveway and park on their carpad, which they'd been doing every day for the past 36 years.

But not anymore.

""We got this email saying we can't park in the pad anymore. I said what, that's crazy,"" recounted Ed.

RELATED: Bay Area man can't stop unwanted Amazon packages from coming in 'brushing scam'

Out of the blue, the couple got a ticket for parking in their own driveway.

""It was very surprising, to say the least,"" said Judy.

And worse? It came with an enormous fine: $1,542 dollars, plus another $250 per day if they didn't get the car off their carpad.

""I wrote them back saying I thought this was a mistake,"" Judy said.

But it was no mistake. And no ordinary parking ticket. It came from the city Planning Department, telling them it's illegal to park in the front of a house.

RELATED: Are gas stations, oil companies price gouging you? Here's what experts say

""And if we were found parking there again, it would be a $1,500 fine,"" Judy said.

And so they quickly pulled the car out -- but none of it made sense.

""Why are you taking away something that has great utility?"" asked Ed.

Ed and Judy had been parking there for nearly four decades. And as far as they could tell, the space was used for parking since the house was built back in 1910 - one of the first in their Noe Valley neighborhood.

""To all of a sudden to be told you can't use something that we could use for years. It's, it's startling. Inexplicable,"" Ed said.

And so the Planning Department gave them a challenge: prove that parking was a historic use on the lot, and they might get a waiver.

""We could be grandfathered in. If we show them a historical photo that showed a car... or a horse-drawn buggy in the carport,"" said Judy.

Right away they dug up a photo of their daughter 34 years ago - a part of the car barely visible.

But officials said: not old enough.

""I did a number of online searches,"" said Ed.

And so they combed through hundreds of historic photos.

Plenty showed the early days, when there were few streets or homes.

""Our house and our neighbor's house had empty fields all around,"" Ed said.

But to find a photo of a car or horse in their particular driveway, back before the days of iPhone cameras?

Nearly impossible.

And then, bingo.

""To me, it's pretty compelling that was a car,"" Ed said.

An aerial photo from 1938 shows their exact home - and Ed is sure he can see a car - or horse-and-buggy -- pulling into his driveway!

""So this little black blob looks like it's pulling into our house,"" Ed said.

It looks like just a blob from above. But Ed says it must be a car -- like all the other blobs you can see along the road.

""I don't know what else they would be,"" he said. ""To me, it's pretty compelling that that was a car pulling in or out of the parking pad.""

They rushed the photo to the Planning Department - the proof they need!

RELATED: FasTrak has the wrong stationery, sends 'toll violation' notices instead of invoices

Right?

Wrong.

""They said that they were too fuzzy,"" Judy said.

The Planning Department said this was not clear evidence.

Officials tell 7 On Your Side the couple was violating a code section banning vehicles in a setback in front of a house, even if it isn't blocking a sidewalk.

Though it's OK to park in front of a garage, like many of their neighbors.

Planning Chief Dan Sider said it was enacted decades ago for aesthetic reasons, to ""Ensure that front yards don't turn into parking lots.""

Yet, it's OK to park in front of a garage, like their neighbors,

""I don't think our car looks any worse than all the cars stacked in front of garages,'' Ed Craine said.

And why enforce the rule after all these decades?

Sider said someone made an anonymous complaint to the city. Two neighbors also got tagged for the same violation, parking in a front driveway.

In an email, Sider wrote:

""I recognize that the property owner is frustrated. I think I would feel the same way in their situation. But the Planning Code doesn't allow for the City to grandfather illegal uses on account of their having flown below the radar for a length of time.""

And so their carport sits empty -- the oil stain a testament to easier days -- as they struggle to park on the hill.

""I had to use my head to keep the trunk open while getting out groceries,'' Judy said.

""The onus is on us to prove we're innocent... though I don't feel guilty,"" Judy said.

The city did close the case without charging any penalties after the couple got the car off the carpad and kept it off. And the city says they could build a covered carport or garage to park there - or maybe find that old photo.

City ends annual reading of murder victim names after list gets too long,https://www.foxnews.com/us/houston-crime-stoppers-ends-annual-reading-murder-victim-names,nottheonion,"On Sunday, crime victim advocates and murder victims' loved ones will gather in Houston for Crime Stoppers' annual ""Day of Remembrance"" as violence continues to grip cities around the country. This year's ceremony, however, will be different from years past.

Officials with Crime Stoppers of Houston said they expect a large crowd to gather in Houston's Midtown neighborhood to pay homage to those murdered in Harris County from August 2021 to August 2022. Unlike in past years, when organizers would read off each homicide victim's name, this year those names will scroll across a screen instead.

Organizers say there are simply too many names to read aloud.

""Three or four years ago, we used to read off the names and ages of the homicide victims for that year,"" Andy Kahan, director of victims services for Crime Stoppers told Fox News Digital. ""We can't do that anymore because it would take hours.""

HUNDREDS REMEMBER SLAIN LSU STUDENT AS MURDER CASE GOES UNSOLVED

Kahan estimates there are more than 600 names that will be scrolling on a ticker instead. In Harris County, at the mid-way point of 2022, homicides were down, but violent crime was up overall compared to 2020, according to data compiled by Crime Stoppers.

As of Thursday morning, Texas' largest city and the fourth largest in the United States, reported 323 murders, the Houston Police Department told Fox News Digital. A department spokesperson noted the numbers were unofficial and had not yet been formalized. The number is a slight decline from the 327 homicides the city reported in 2021 as of Sept. 22, 2021. For all of 2021, Houston experienced 473 killings, officials said, up from 261 murders in 2020.

As 2022 arrived, Houston and the county experienced multiple killings involving children. Many were fatally shot unintentionally, such as Arlene Alvarez, who was killed while riding with her family to get dinner.

She died after a man began shooting at their vehicle thinking it was the suspect who had robbed him at an ATM moments earlier. Other killings stemmed from apparent road rage incidents.

Jim McIngvale, known in the Houston area as ""Mattress Mack,"" owns the Galley Furniture chain. He teamed up with Crime Stoppers and other groups over the summer in an effort to keep children safe over the school break. He said the violence has impacted one of his employees who lost a teenage child to gun violence.

""These sorts of things touch home, and we can do better than this,"" he told Fox News Digital.

""These sorts of things touch home, and we can do better than this.""

Like many municipalities, Harris County has seen an uptick in violent crime in recent years amid calls to ""defund the police.""

The crime problem is the result of a combination of issues, including the backlog of cases and the release of criminal defendants out on bond, he said.

Crime Stoppers Houston has been tracking such cases for several years.

One of those victims was Joshua Sandoval, who was killed May 27, 2021, when he was followed to his Houston home and shot during a robbery. The suspect arrested in the killing was allegedly part of an organized crime ring and was free on two felony bonds, authorities said.

Devan Jordan, 22, was charged with capital murder in the slaying of Sandoval, a 28-year-old who worked in the boxing industry. On the day of the killing, Jordan failed to appear in court to get an electronic monitoring device put on, in addition to missing a previous court date, and was never picked up by law enforcement.

Two weeks after the slaying, he allegedly killed another man in nearby Galveston County. He was arrested and later linked to Sandoval's death.

""When he missed his court hearing, nothing was done about it,"" Sandoval's sister, Aimee Castillo, told Fox News. ""When they ended cash bond, that to me is ridiculous. If you can't afford to get out of jail then don't do the crime.""

Castillo said she plans to attend Sunday's remembrance event.

""I want my children to be able to walk my grandchildren down the street at night in any neighborhood and not be fearful that somebody is going to come by and do a drive-by shooting,"" McIngvale told Fox News Digital. ""Every neighborhood in Houston should be safe whether it’s low-end, middle-end or high-end. We all deserve to have a safe place.

""That’s one thing we all have to work on, is making Houston and Harris County the safest county in Texas, not the death list."""

JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel on Monday called on Amnesty International not to publish an upcoming report accusing it of apartheid, saying the conclusions of the London-based international human rights group are “false, biased and antisemitic.”

Amnesty is expected to join the New York-based Human Rights Watch and the Israeli rights group B’Tselem in accusing Israel of the international crime of apartheid based on its nearly 55-year military occupation of lands the Palestinians want for a future state and because of its treatment of its own Arab minority.

Israel dismissed the other reports as biased, but is adopting a much more adversarial stance this time around. Foreign Minister Yair Lapid has said Israel expects intensified efforts this year to brand it as an apartheid state in international bodies and hopes to head them off.

In a statement issued Monday, he said Amnesty “is just another radical organization which echoes propaganda, without seriously checking the facts,” and that it “echoes the same lies shared by terrorist organizations.”

“Israel isn’t perfect, but we are a democracy committed to international law, open to criticism, with a free press and a strong and independent judicial system,” Lapid said.

Amnesty did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Amnesty’s report “denies the state of Israel’s right to exist as the nation state of the Jewish people.”

“Its extremist language and distortion of historical context were designed to demonize Israel and pour fuel onto the fire of antisemitism,” it added.

Neither Human Rights Watch nor B’Tselem compared Israel to South Africa, where an apartheid system based on white supremacy and racial segregation was in place from 1948 until the early 1990s. Instead, they evaluate Israel’s policies based on international conventions like the Rome Statute, which defines apartheid as “an institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group over any other racial group.”

They argue that Israel’s various policies in the territories under its control are aimed at preserving a Jewish majority in as much of the land as possible by systematically denying basic rights to Palestinians. Israel says its policies are aimed at ensuring the survival and security of the world’s only Jewish state.

The International Criminal Court is already investigating potential war crimes committed by Israel and Palestinian militants in the occupied territories. After last year’s Gaza war, the U.N. Human Rights Council set up a permanent commission of inquiry to investigate abuses in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza, including “systematic discrimination and repression based on national, ethnic, racial or religious identity.”

Israel has accused both the ICC and the U.N. rights body of being biased against it."
Supply shortages mean Norwegian conscipts must return their used underwear at the end of their miltary services,https://www.insider.com/norwegian-conscripts-will-now-have-to-return-their-used-underwear-2022-1,nottheonion,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to supply chain shortages across the globe.

Its latest impact is on the underwear of Norway's enlisted service members.

Conscripts will now have to return their intimates to be reused by their successors.

Norweigan's enlisted will now have to return their used underwear – as well as bras and socks – after their service is done due to supply shortages, Euronews reported.

The Guardian reported that the Army made the decision because of dwindling supplies and supply chain issues caused by the pandemic making it hard for them to get more.

""The decision to reuse this part of the kit will help us have more volume in circulation and increase the delivery capacity of the equipment. We have too little in stock,"" Army Logistics spokesman Hans Meisingset said.

Meisingset told Insider the top clothing suppliers for conscripts are Equipnor, which produces clothes in Norway, Europe, and China; Oskar Pedersen which has production in China; Granqvist, which has production in Poland with materials from Africa; Costas Siamidis, which has production in Greece and Albania with materials from Asia; and Bergans, which has production in Vietnam.

""The pandemic has influenced the flow of materials to the production sites as well as the logistics supply chain from the production sites to Norway,"" Meisingset said adding that the cost to import has substantially increased.

Euronews, citing public broadcaster NRK, reported that in years past, conscripts could voluntarily return their intimates, but now it's mandatory.

""The linen is washed, cleaned, and checked. What we distribute is in good condition,"" Meisingset said.

The Guardian reported that a conscripts' representative told a local trade outlet that the shortages could impact the operations of those enlisted.

""Severe shortages of equipment and clothing can potentially affect operational readiness and, in the worst case, the safety of the soldier,"" Eirik Sjøhelle Eiksund told the Norwegian trade publication Forsvarets Forum.

Norway has compulsory conscription but not everyone ends up being drafted. Every year, those who are old enough to be drafted get a self-declaration form from the armed forces asking them for details about their physical and mental health, criminal record, as well as how motivated they are to join. Then the most fitted candidates are selected to move on to the next phase.

In 2015, the country extended conscription to include women. Overall, only about 8,000 to 10,000 conscripts will be selected from around 60,000 draftable Norwegians in each class."
Fla. surgeon general claims masks didn't save lives during the pandemic,https://www.abcactionnews.com/news/state/fla-surgeon-general-claims-masks-dont-save-lives-during-the-pandemic,nottheonion,"PANAMA CITY, Fla. — Florida’s surgeon general, Dr. Joseph Ladapo, made claims Thursday that masks didn’t save lives during the COVID-19 pandemic and criticized doctors who recommended or mandated wearing masks.

Dr. Ladapo was speaking during a campaign-style event in Panama City with Governor Ron DeSantis and others when he made his claims.

“What did the two randomized clinical trials that we’ve done during the pandemic, what did they show? Ask them that when they tell you that these things save lives,” Ladapo said. “One found nothing, zero benefit. The other found a small benefit, like a tiny benefit that’s a little bit methodologically shaky. And by the way, none of them found a benefit in young people. Not a single one found a benefit in young people. That’s the highest-quality evidence, that’s what it showed.”

Ladapo went on to criticize the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for using what he called lower quality studies for its data. He then inferred doctors and other researchers who found the usefulness of masks must have “been taken over by zombies or something.”

His claim that studies have found no benefit from masks have been proven wrong in repeated studies including ones by:

Surgeon General Ladapo didn’t endorse or mention vaccines when he then spoke of what saves lives during a pandemic.

“What saves lives, frankly, is freedom to speak, freedom to find truth, what saves lives is immunity, ya know?” Ladapo said. “Early treatment saves lives. And being as healthy as you can, losing the extra pounds, eating a nutritious diet, keeping your vitamin d levels up, those things save lives.”

Ladapo said about masks saving lives, “People need to unbelieve it.”

The press conference/rally was held to give a public push to a bill that would prevent doctors from being punished over “free speech.” Governor DeSantis introduced Dr. Jon Ward at the press conference who he said was the engine behind the movement.

Dr. Ward is a board-certified dermatologist and board-certified Mohs surgeon but has no experience in epidemiology or virology based on his bio from Dermatology Specialists.

Dr. Ward echoed much of what Ladapo said and said, “Your doctors are being silenced” before saying state certifying boards “have become political arms of the CDC and big Pharma.”

“Dr. Fauci, big Pharma, they orchestrated, with a compliant media, the takedown of any physician who didn’t echo the narrative that we needed to mask school children and we didn’t have to make vaccines mandatory,” Ward said as the reason for the bill being championed by DeSantis and Ladapo.

In a statement issued shortly after Ladapo's remarks at DeSantis' event, members of the Committee to Protect Health Care took aim at what they called ""disinformation"" from the surgeon general."

Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) railed against the indictment of former Trump White House adviser Peter Navarro while saying in an interview on Friday that “if you’re a Republican, you can’t even lie to Congress or lie to an FBI agent or they’re coming after you.”

Gohmert, speaking to Newsmax in an interview on Friday, was asked to comment on the Friday indictment of Navarro by a federal grand jury after the former Trump official failed to comply with the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.

“It actually puts an exclamation point on the fact that we have a two-tiered justice system. If you’re a Republican, you can’t even lie to Congress or lie to an FBI agent or they’re coming after you. They’re gonna bury you. They’re gonna put you in the D.C. jail and terrorize and torture you and not live up to the Constitution there,” Gohmert responded.

He argued that there was a double standard to how Democrats and Republicans were being treated, pointing to the acquittal of prominent Democratic attorney Michael Sussmann, who was being investigated by special counsel John Durham, as one example.

“So [it’s] very clear. If you’re a Democrat, then you can lie. You can cheat. You can do whatever you want,” he said.

The Hill has reached out to Gohmert’s office for further comment and clarification on his remarks.

The development comes against the backdrop of Navarro’s indictment, who is facing two charges of criminal contempt of Congress after being subpoenaed by the House select committee.

The committee is interested in hearing from the former Trump official, looking to hear possible evidence regarding efforts to have the 2020 election results overturned by allies of former President Trump.

“Who are these people?” Navarro asked during his court appearance on Friday. “This is not America. I mean, I was a distinguished public servant for four years and nobody ever questioned my ethics. And they’re treating me in this fashion.”"

City of Kent reaches $1.5 million settlement with former assistant police chief over Nazi insignia,https://www.q13fox.com/news/city-of-kent-reaches-1-5-million-settlement-with-former-assistant-police-chief-over-nazi-insignia,nottheonion,"The City of Kent reached a $1.5 million settlement with an assistant police chief who was put on leave for posting a Nazi insignia on his office door and joking about the Holocaust.

Assistant Chief Derek Kammerzell was given two weeks off without pay by Kent Police Chief Rafael Padilla in July after an internal investigation concluded that Kammerzell knew the meaning of an insignia he posted above the nameplate on his office door in September 2020 — that of an SS ""obergruppenfuhrer,"" one of the senior-most ranks in the Third Reich.

The insignia was taken down after four days when a detective in the investigations bureau, which Kammerzell commanded, filed a complaint.

Kammerzell previously oversaw the department’s patrol division.

In addition to the two weeks without pay — during which Kammerzell was allowed to take paid vacation to make up his salary — he was ordered to attend ""cultural sensitivity training.""

After an outcry from the community, Kammerzell was placed on paid administrative leave and asked to resign in December 2021.

On June 10, 2022, the City of Kent wrote in a statement:

""While this is a substantial sum, we strongly believe that settling this matter will be a substantial step towards meeting our commitment to the community and continuing with the excellent work the Police Department is doing. It was clear the Assistant Chief would have significant difficulty being an effective leader in the Department of Community, and that his presence would distract from the mission of the Department. The Police Department is prepared to move on. With this backdrop, City Councilmembers have expressed support for this decision.""

See the full statement here:

Kammerzell previously told The Kent Reporter in an email that he is ""deeply embarrassed by this incident.""

""I wish I could take it back. I know now what that rank represents, and that is not what I value or who I am,"" he said.

Kammerzell said years ago someone in the department began to refer to him as the ""German general"" due to his Germanic heritage and he embraced the nickname."
Japanese Schools Have Banned Ponytails Claiming They Could 'Sexually Excite' Boys,https://www.news18.com/news/buzz/japanese-schools-have-banned-ponytails-claiming-they-could-sexually-excite-boys-4867025.html,nottheonion,"Japanese schools have banned female students from tying ponytails, claiming that the hairstyle “sexually excites"" males. Japan’s schools are infamous for imposing absurd strictures, such as those on length of socks and colour of underwear, reports VICE World News. The Vice report quoted a former middle school teacher who said that school admin told him girl students exposing the nape of their necks could “sexually excite"" boys. “They’re worried boys will look at girls, which is similar to the reasoning behind upholding a white-only underwear colour rule,"" the teacher told the publication. He added that students are compelled to accept these norms because there is very little criticism against them. A 2020 survey suggests that in the southern prefecture of Fukuoka, about one in ten schools bans the ponytail.

This is only one of the many draconian rules in Japanese schools, known as buraku kosoku. Japanese schools’ strictures are not just regressive but also arbitrary. For instance, a bob hairstyle is allowed even though it exposes about as much of the neck as a ponytail. An undercut, on the other hand, is prohibited. Students often receive no explanations for the imposition of these rules.

Asao Naito, an associate professor of sociology from Meiji University, told VICE that even though the rules vary from school to school and across generations, the intended impact is to ensure that no one stands out from the crowd.

The rule is akin to many such absurd impositions that are imposed in North Korea. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has last year put a ban on wearing skinny jeans, sporting mullet hairstyles and some body piercings keeping in line with the country’s crackdown on ‘capitalistic lifestyle’ and Western influences on youths. The state run newspaper had recently warned the nation of doing more to stop “capitalistic culture from seeping into the country"", as was reported by South Korean broadcaster Yonhap news agency.

The agency said that leader Kim Jong-un had also outlawed ‘non-socialist’ hairstyles such as the spike and mullet along with dyed hair. As part of the new laws, men and women can only sport one of the 215 other hairstyles authorised, reports said. The provincial Youth League has also issued an order on hairstyles it deems proper to sport. Hairstyles such as mullets and spikes have been considered ‘anti-social’.

"Sweet justice: Ringleader of Canada's notorious maple syrup heist must pay more than $9M in fines, top court rules",https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/sweet-justice-ringleader-of-canada-s-notorious-maple-syrup-heist-must-pay-more-than-9m-in-fines-top-court-rules-1.5842553,nottheonion,"The Supreme Court of Canada has upheld a $9 million fine imposed on one of the ringleaders of Canada's notorious maple syrup heist.

In a decision published Thursday, the Supreme Court said it has sided with the Crown in a unanimous decision after the defence launched an appeal to reduce the fine imposed on one of the ringleaders of the 2012 heist: Richard Vallieres.

Vallières was found guilty of fraud, trafficking and theft of 9,500 barrels of maple syrup between 2011 and 2012 from a warehouse in Saint-Louis-de-Blandford, in the Quebec City region. The 2,700 tonnes of syrup, stolen from the Federation of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers, was worth about $18 million.



The heist was discovered after the federation performed a routine inventory check of its warehouse and found barrels containing water instead of maple syrup.

The Quebec provincial police arrested 16 people in total.



One of those arrested was Vallières, who was found guilty of fraud, trafficking and theft. Though the stolen syrup was worth over $18 million, during the trial in Quebec Superior Court, he said he sold the syrup for $10 million and made a personal profit of about $1 million.

The Quebec Superior Court first ordered Vallières to pay nearly $10 million in fines over 10 years, and the Court of Appeal then lowered the fine to $1 million. That decision was then brought to the nation’s highest court, which determined that a court cannot limit the amount of a fine to the profit made by an offender.



The Supreme Court of Canada, which heard the case last November, agreed with the Superior Court's interpretation. It subtracted $828,602.43, an amount subject to a restitution order.

""Mr. Vallières must pay a fine equal to the value of the stolen syrup. This amounted to more than $9 million (in other words, $10 million for which he sold the syrup minus the amount he owed to the Federation under a separate court order). Mr. Vallières has 10 years to pay this fine or else he must serve six years in prison,"" said Chief Justice Wagner, writing for the court.



The Supreme Court determined that Vallières had not proven at trial or on appeal that the $10-million fine should be divided between him and the other thieves.



""As a result, the trial judge had no choice but to order him to pay the full amount,"" the ruling reads.

UK doctor warns women not to put ice lollies in their vagina to cool down in hot weather,https://www.examinerlive.co.uk/news/local-news/uk-doctor-warns-women-not-24506693,nottheonion,"With record breaking temperatures forecast for Monday and Tuesday, people may be driven to extreme measures to cool down in the heat.

For the first time ever, a red weather warning for extreme heat has been issued for Yorkshire and other parts of the UK for Monday and Tuesday, with the Met Office warning it could even lead to a loss of life. It has warned the heat could lead to widespread impacts on people and infrastructure and that record breaking temperatures could be seen.

And while there's plenty of good advice online for how to keep cool, there's one suggestion that has reared its head in the past that women are being reminded again not to pay attention to.

UK doctor Eleanor Draeger, a sexual health consultant, took to Twitter to give her ""regular reminder"" to women not to place ice lollies in their vaginas to keep cool. Asked how often she has to issue the guidance, she replied: ""More often than you would think!""

It's not the first time that such warnings have been issued. Speaking to Metro back in 2019, Dr Sarah Welsh, the co-founder of HANX condom brand, warned women not to put ice lollies anywhere near their genitals.

She said: ""The vagina is composed of very delicate and sensitive skin, hence things that may seem innocent to other areas of the body, if they come in contact with the vagina, can cause infections, irritations and damage. There are many things that should never go near a vagina and ice lollies are up there. The ice can stick to the delicate skin of the vagina and cause real trauma and damage.""

Dr Welsh continued to say that the sugar in the lolly could potentially disrupt the natural pH of the vagina and if all that didn't sound horrible enough, there's also the added concern that the lolly could break inside of you.

Dr Shree Datta, a consultant gynaecologist from MyHealthcare Clinic seconded the words of caution and shared some advice for keep cool in the heat without harming your genitals.

""My advice would be to avoid any foreign bodies in the vagina for risk of infection,"" she added. ""I would suggest loose cotton underwear and avoiding tight clothing to prevent any irritation and dermatitis developing.

""A cool shower (without internal douching), and keeping well hydrated should suffice.""

Minecraft DDoS Attack Leaves Small European Country Without Internet,https://www.tomshardware.com/news/minecraft-ddos-attack-leaves-small-european-country-without-internet,nottheonion,"Andorra Telecom, the only ISP in the principality of Andorra, suffered repeated distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks during a multi-day Twitch gaming tournament. The DDoS attacks occurred during the scheduled SquidCraft Games tournament in Minecraft, one of the most successful (opens in new tab) Twitch Rivals tournaments ever broadcast. Eight or more Andorran streamers were eliminated from the Twitch tournament after the second day of attacks due to their repeated disconnects. There is some suspicion that perpetrators planned the DDoS attacks on Andorra Telecom to cheat the Andorran's of their chance to win the $100,000 pot.

The SquidCraft Games was a highly anticipated Twitch streaming event designed to emulate the hit Netflix series called The Squid Game in Minecraft. As noted, it has been a viral game streaming event with a peak viewership of over a million on day two of the event. As per the TV series, this is an elimination game, and in this Twitch event, there is a healthy prize pot of $100,000 to ensure participants would be highly competitive. The event will end on Tuesday.

Ordinary Andorran Internet Users Become Collateral Damage in the SquidCraft Games

A significant portion of the 150 SquidCraft games participants lives in Andorra. Spanish language reports of the event confirm that day one went without a hitch for all players, in terms of fairness. The games ""green light, red light,"" and ""hide and seek"" ran smoothly to their conclusions.

The ""cookie game"" had to be suspended on day two due to a programming glitch. After that, however, the DDoS attack on Andorra Telecom began, and eight or more remaining participants from the principality all had their connections and Twitch streaming cut simultaneously. Unfortunately, the whole of Andorra had little or no internet connectivity for over half an hour after the start of the DDoS attacks.

(Image credit: Twitch)

About an hour after the DDoS had caused the above Twitch tournament calamity for the streamers, Andorra Telecom Tweeted to admit that it was getting back to normal after a DDoS attack. Until that time, the disgruntled SquidCraft Games participants could only postulate on the reasons for their disconnects. The Andorran contingent returned on the following day of the tournament, but another DDoS on Andorra Telecom inspired an exasperated sounding Tweet from the ISP.

All the Andorran participants in the SquidCraft Games got eliminated from the Twitch tournament. It is sad and unfair to go out this way, but the organizers didn't have a lot of choices.

Highly Suspicious DDoS

Some suspect that DDoS attacks targeted Andorra Telecom due to this tournament and the large prize at stake. For example, on Twitter, Internet observers NetBlocks asserted that the Saturday evening attack was confirmed to be targeted at Team Andorra. Hopefully, some follow-up investigations and reports will point the finger more accurately, and the perpetrator disclosed.



Meanwhile, The SquidCraft Games continues into day four of six later today (from 2 pm ET), with 42 Twitch streamers left."
"Indian student arrested for wishing peace, harmony, and unity to every nation on Pakistan Republic Day",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mudhol-woman-held-following-complaint-by-activist/article65262290.ece,nottheonion,"March 26, 2022 10:14 pm | Updated 10:14 pm IST - Belagavi

The Bagalkot district police have arrested Kuthma Sheikh, 25, a resident of Mudhol following a complaint by an individual that she was wishing people on Pakistan’s Republic Day. The woman is a senior student at a madrassa in Mudhol.

She posted a WhatsApp status on March 23, Pakistan’s Republic Day, in Urdu and it read: “May God bless every nation with peace, unity and harmony”.

This was seen by Arun Kumar Bhajantri, a Mudhol-based activist, who registered a complaint against her, saying she was trying to create enmity between communities and that she should be booked for treason, as she had posted the message on Pakistan Republic Day. The complaint was filed on March 24.

The police, however, booked her under Sections 153-A (creating enmity between groups on the basis of religion, race, etc) and 505-2 of IPC (statements promoting enmity between groups).

The accused was arrested and remanded in judicial custody on March 24. The arrest was made to preserve peace and maintain law and order, the police said.

“Her post could be interpreted as if it was meant to commemorate the Pakistan’s Republic Day. It could lead to unrest and protests and counter-protests, if we had not acted on time,” a senior police officer said.

However, some activists have opposed the move. Bheemanagouda Paragonda, Athani-based lawyer and RTI activist, said the police had to use their wisdom and judgment before arresting persons. The allegations made in the complaint would not stand legal scrutiny. Innocent people would be harassed by the knee-jerk reactions of the police, he said."

Bavaria police find crystal meth in doughnut,https://www.dw.com/en/bavaria-police-find-crystal-meth-in-doughnut/a-63605930,nottheonion,"Border police in the German state of Bavaria say they found portions of crystal meth hidden inside a doughnut.

Bavarian border officials said they had detained a 33-year-old man after a check on a train entering Germany from the neighboring Czech Republic revealed crystal meth stowed inside his sugary snack.

Police described the concealment method, with sachets of the drug hidden where the jam would normally be injected, as a first in their jurisdiction.

What do we know so far?

The arrest took place Sunday near the border town of Schirnding in Bavaria's Upper Franconia region.

Officials said only that the circumstance of the search had led to them taking a greater interest in the holeless doughnut than they normally would, without giving further details.

They sliced into the pastry — locally known as a Krapfen — and found the crystal meth inside. Public broadcaster Bayerischer Rundfunk reported that they were stashed inside a zip lock bag and two condoms.

""This was a first for a first for our area - we have never had doughnuts as a smuggling stash,"" said a police spokesman. ""This did not stay hidden from the experienced officials.""

After seizing the drugs, police filed a complaint against the man from Nuremberg, who was allowed to continue his journey.

What is crystal meth?

Crystal meth, also known as methamphetamine, ice, and glass, is a popular party drug that comes as clear crystal chunks or shiny blue-white rocks.

It is highly addictive and affects the central nervous system, with prolonged use causing changes to the structure of the brain.

Visible lesions and scars can emerge on the face of users who are addicted, along with a gaunt appearance and a hallow, sunken face. Dental hygiene also suffers considerably as the drug's smoke damages the gums and teeth.

Crystal meth has a long history in the Czech Republic — known as the meth capital of Europe — and takes the place of other substances used more commonly elsewhere.

The analysis of samples from 80 cities across 25 European countries revealed that the five cities with the highest concentration of it in wastewater were all in the Czech Republic.

Use of the drug is also high in Germany, with Chemnitz, Dresden and Erfurt, all cities in the former East Germany, topping the list of places it is most commonly consumed.

Production in Europe has historically taken place in small ""kitchen"" laboratories in Czech Republic and neighboring countries.

However, it also now also occurring at industrial-scale laboratories in the Netherlands and Belgium.

Channel 4 buys painting by Hitler – and may let Jimmy Carr destroy it,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/oct/13/channel-4-show-art-trouble-hitler-painting,nottheonion,"Channel 4 has bought a painting by Adolf Hitler and will allow a studio audience to decide whether Jimmy Carr should destroy it.

As part of its latest season of programmes, the TV channel has bought artworks by a range of “problematic” artists, including Pablo Picasso, as well as convicted paedophile Rolf Harris and sexual abuser Eric Gill.

A forthcoming televised debate called Jimmy Carr Destroys Art, airing later this month, will then question whether you can truly separate a work of art from its creator – before deciding which pieces to destroy.

Ian Katz, Channel 4’s director of programming, confirmed that if the studio audience chose to save the painting by Hitler it would not hang in the Channel 4 boardroom but would be “appropriately” disposed of.

He suggested that if Channel 4 was privatised by the government, then a for-profit owner would be unlikely to take such risks: “This kind of programming is difficult and expensive. And probably not a rational, commercial approach.”

Katz explained the concept of the show. “There are advocates for each piece of art,” he said. “So you’ve got an advocate for Hitler. There’ll be someone arguing not for Hitler, but for the fact that his moral character should not decide whether or not a piece of art exists or not.”

He said the show celebrates Channel 4’s long tradition of “iconoclasm and irreverence” that saw it once televise an autopsy and give people drugs on live television.

Channel 4 hired an art expert to buy the works “from reputable auction houses”, although there is a long history of doubts over the attribution of Hitler’s art. Given the broadcaster’s budget, the Picasso work is “a vase of some description” rather than one of his paintings.

The works under debate on the show will be destroyed with a variety of tools including a flamethrower [see footnote].

Carr himself has been criticised for his jokes, with one about the Holocaust in a recent Netflix special being condemned by a litany of anti-hate groups earlier this year.

Katz unveiled details of the programme in an interview reflecting on his five years as director of programming for Channel 4. The broadcaster, which is celebrating its 40th birthday next month, is facing pressure from the ongoing decline of traditional live television viewing, and has been overtaken by Netflix in terms of overall British television audience viewing – all while continuing to fight attempts by the government to privatise the channel.

“There’s no argument that it is significantly harder to cut through to a big audience these days,” said Katz. “The broadcast environment is completely different to what it was 40 years ago when there were two other state broadcasters and Channel 4 popped up on the scene.”

He warned this is creating incentives for television commissioners to stick to tried-and-trusted formats rather than taking risks on more experimental output, such as comedies Stath Lets Flats or We Are Lady Parts. “I could put true crime on in just about every slot and probably have double the ratings,” he said.

Katz quoted Jeremy Isaacs, the station’s founder, as saying that Channel 4 should be watched by everyone some of the time – but not everybody all the time. “I think you might add that Channel 4 should be annoying everyone some of the time, but ideally not everyone all the time,” he added.

Channel 4 has a record of nurturing new talent, such as comedian Mo Gilligan and End of the Fucking World writer Charlie Covell, only to see them move on to bigger money deals elsewhere.

Katz said he tries to stay in touch with stars and offer them the chance to return to Channel 4 for more experimental material. “Nobody wants to see all their kids locked up at home. But you want them to come back and see you occasionally for Sunday lunch,” he said.

Another issue is when the broadcaster’s own staff object to output. He said with particular territories “you are treading into a hotly contested, extremely emotional area and you have to tread with real care and sensitivity”.

He added: “When I first arrived we had a film about trans kids which caused a huge amount of debate and quite a lot of pain, outside the channel and inside the channel … It just makes the process of tackling some of these issues a bit more complex and it requires a lot of care and sensitivity about how you approach them.”

Katz also reflected on the latest Channel 4 controversy, when Bake Off presenters Matt Lucas and Noel Fielding were accused of cultural insensitivity towards Mexican people. He said: “I am a huge enthusiast of every aspect of Mexico and its culture and I would hate to offend anyone in Mexico.”

Katz, a former deputy editor of the Guardian, was a surprise choice for the job when he was elevated from editor of BBC Newsnight to Channel 4’s director of programmes in January 2018.

“In my first year it was a very, very steep learning curve,” he said. “I think I knew half a dozen television people and the first thing I had to do was figure out who everyone was. But you don’t realise until you do it that Channel 4 is the freest place in the world to make television.”

Plans to produce a series on modern Britain presented by Paul Dacre have been put “on hold” after the former Daily Mail editor became too busy with other projects, although the broadcaster will push ahead with a documentary about men with abnormally large penises."
"Mark Zuckerberg doesn’t like your scrolling habits: Social media is for ‘building relationships,’ not just consuming content",https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/04/zuckerberg-social-media-is-for-building-relationships-not-scrolling.html,nottheonion,"While Mark Zuckerberg spends most of his days on social media, you won't find him mindlessly scrolling through Instagram Reels.

That's because Zuckerberg thinks social media is best when used to communicate. On a recent episode of the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, the Meta CEO said he thinks platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter can be beneficial to users' well-being — but primarily when they're used to connect with others.

""If you're just sitting there and consuming stuff, I mean, it's not necessarily bad, but it generally isn't associated with all the positive benefits you get from being actively engaged or building relationships,"" the tech billionaire said.

Zuckerberg isn't the only one discouraging that sort of social media over-consumption. Research indicates excessive use of social media can lead to depression and anxiety among some users. But experts also say that's only true if people are using platforms to solely scroll, rather than interact with others.

""Routine social media use"" — like ""responding to content others share"" daily — is actually linked to positive social well-being and overall mental health, a 2019 study conducted by Harvard University researchers suggests.

However, the opposite becomes true when people develop too much of a dependence on social media, or an unhealthy emotional connection."
Uvalde superintendent says district to hire more police,https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/ap-top-news/2022/06/09/uvalde-superintendent-says-district-to-hire-more-police,nottheonion,"UVALDE, Texas (AP) — As the small Texas city of Uvalde struggles to heal after a gunman killed 19 children and two teachers at an elementary school, thoughts have also turned to ensuring its legacy as the centerpiece of the fight for equal education for Mexican Americans over half a century ago lives on.

In 1970, there was a six-week student walkout in the district, after the school board decided not to renew the contract of George Garza, a popular Mexican American teacher at Robb Elementary School. Student demands included a bilingual curriculum and the hiring of more Mexican American teachers, but the school board refused to budge. A resulting class-action lawsuit alleging discrimination against Hispanic students resulted in the district being placed under a desegregation order in a case that took decades to resolve.

Now, some Hispanic leaders in Uvalde worry that upward mobility through education here could be another victim of the May 24 shooting if students fear returning to school.

“I keep thinking about education,” said Ronnie Garza, who is George Garza's son and a county commissioner who represents the area of Uvalde that includes Robb Elementary. “I feel for the children. How are they going to feel on the first day of school? I keep thinking of the teachers. Are they going to want to come back to school?”

More than an hour passed from when the first police officers followed the 18-year-old gunman into the building and when he was killed, according to an official timeline. In the meantime, parents outside begged police to rush in and panicked children called 911 from inside.

The head of the Texas Department of Public Safety, Steven McCraw, has said that the school district police chief, Pete Arredondo, who was in charge of the multiagency response, made the “wrong decision” to not order officers to breach the classroom more quickly to confront and kill the gunman.

Arredondo has not responded to repeated interview requests and questions from The Associated Press, but has defended the response.

During a sometimes contentious news conference on Thursday, Uvalde school district officials said they wouldn’t answer any questions about the investigation or personnel matters, even as parents have expressed concerns about safety. When Superintendent Hal Harrell was asked if he still trusts Arredondo, he said, “that’s personnel.”

Harrell said the district would be hiring more police officers in the fall, and that there are ongoing discussions about what will become of the site where the school is located.

“We will not be going back to that campus in any form or fashion,” Harrell said.

Uvalde County Justice of the Peace Lalo Diaz, who helped identify the bodies of those who were killed at the school that he himself attended, said tearing it down will be the right thing to do.

“It’s going to be hard for anybody to go in there,” Diaz said.

In the aftermath of mass shootings at schools across the country, communities have struggled with what to do with the buildings. In Newtown, Connecticut, voters authorized the demolition of the Sandy Hook Elementary School building where 26 students and teachers were killed in 2012 and construction of a new school. In Colorado, Columbine High School, where 13 were killed in a 1999 attack, still stands.

At the now-closed Robb Elementary campus, some of the pecan trees planted by George Garza still provide shade. Garza had also raised money for a basketball court and a running track at the school.

Alfredo Rodriguez Santos was a 17-year-old high school student in Uvalde in 1970 when he decided to participate in the walk out. Santos said that the inequality in the city was something that had already been seeping into his consciousness.

“We sensed things were off, but we weren’t able to articulate them,” said Santos, who had wondered why roads were better in one part of town than the other and why Mexican American students weren't encouraged to go to college.

“We knew that something was wrong because a lot of kids were dropping out of school. Not a whole lot of kids were going to college,"" said Santos, who now lives in Austin and is publisher of bilingual newspapers.

Monica Muñoz Martinez, an associate professor of history at the University of Texas at Austin who grew up in Uvalde and attended Robb Elementary in the 1990s, said both of her parents participated in the walk out when they were in high school.

Martinez's mom had to translate so her own Spanish-speaking mother could understand school meetings and assemblies that were only held in English.

“That’s one of her memories from Robb is sitting outside the door trying to listen through the crack to give an overview to her mother when she walked out of the meeting,” Martinez said.

Uvalde “stands apart” from other walk outs happening around that time, Martinez said, because the school board decided not to meet any of the demands from the parents and students.

“Leaders in Uvalde at that moment ... were sending the strong signal that the racial order that existed there, they were committed to maintaining,” she said.

In 1970, Genoveva Morales filed a class-action lawsuit against the school district alleging discrimination against Hispanic students. Eventually, a court found segregation still existed and the district was ordered to desegregate. A consent order was signed in 2008 and the lawsuit was finally resolved in 2017.

Martinez's mother went on to work in the school district for 35 years, including as an administrator, and was a member of the school board when the junior high was named for Morales.

The parents of some of those killed at Robb Elementary and injured students have been speaking out, including giving testimony this week to Congress as lawmakers work to strike a bipartisan agreement on gun safety measures.

“I hope that the voices of people from Uvalde who are calling for change, that that can be a catalyst to actually helping to save more lives, not just in Texas but across the country,” Martinez said.

Minister says people should work more hours or move to a better job to protect themselves from cost of living surge,https://news.sky.com/story/minister-says-people-should-work-more-hours-or-move-to-a-better-job-to-protect-themselves-from-cost-of-living-surge-12614360,nottheonion,"A government minister has suggested that people struggling with the cost of living could take on more hours or move to a better-paid job.

Rachel Maclean, the safeguarding minister, told Sky News' Kay Burley that those were some of the ways households could ""protect themselves"" as prices soar.

Downing Street defended her after opposition parties sharply criticised the comments.

Ms Maclean said that every minister was looking at the issue as consumers face ""short term pressures"" such as high energy and food bills - and added that there was ""more help coming"".

But she added: ""Over the long term we need to have a plan to grow the economy and make sure that people are able to protect themselves better - whether that is by taking on more hours or moving to a better paid job and these are long term actions but that's what we're focused on as a government.""

Pressed over evidence that some people were working three jobs but still having to visit food banks, she added: ""We have often heard in the past when people are facing problems with their budgets that one of the obstacles - and it may not be for everybody - is about being able to take on more hours or even move to a better-paid job.

""Of course, it's an individual situation, depending on that particular family's situation but that's why the job centres exist, that's why the work coaches exist, that's why we've put the support into those job centres - to work with individuals on their own individual situation.

""So it may be right for some people - they may be able to access additional hours.

""But of course it's not going to work for people who are already working in three jobs.""

Help being given to schools and through local authorities would target assistance ""where it's most needed"", she said.

Ms Maclean added: ""We've already taken action to help people with energy bills and there's more help coming.""

Those comments echoed a hint made by Boris Johnson last week about more cost of living support - though this was swiftly followed by the Treasury making clear that there would be no emergency budget.

That followed an announcement in February by the chancellor that most households would be given a £150 council tax discount while consumers would also be given £200 to help with energy bills this autumn, to be repaid over five years.

Labour's Peter Kyle, shadow Northern Ireland secretary, criticised Ms Maclean's cost of living comments, describing how he recently met people at a food bank who were in work but having an ""extremely difficult"" time including a single mother with two jobs.

He told Sky News: ""The idea that she could work longer and therefore not spend more time with her family - I think it's just disconnected from the realities of people's lives.""

Mr Kyle also referred to recent comments by environment secretary George Eustice, who suggested people struggling with higher shop prices should buy value brands.

The Labour MP said: ""What we need ministers to be doing is solving the economic problems that families have because of the economic problems our country faces.

""Their jobs as politicians aren't just to tell people to work harder, work longer and go for a promotion.

""It's actually to accept the reality that because of the decisions they are making in Westminster, people are no longer able to eat a decent diet.""

Liberal Democrat work and pensions spokesperson Wendy Chamberlain said: ""So the Conservatives' answer to the cost-of-living emergency is that people should just earn more? This shows just how out of touch they truly are.

""Millions of families have had to make huge cutbacks and taken on extra work in order to weather the cost of living crisis. They simply cannot do any more.""

The prime minister's official spokesperson said: ""I think the minister was clear in what she said that people's individual circumstances will vary. That's why we have a range of measures available to people.

""It's entirely right that as a government we want to find ways to help more people get into work and just get into secure higher paying salaries as well""

Ms Maclean later claimed in a tweet that her comments about ""a longer term plan and options for some people"" had been misrepresented."

Cruise ship heads to Bahamas after U.S. issues arrest warrant,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/crystal-symphony-arrest-warrant-unpaid-fuel-bahamas/,nottheonion,"A cruise ship that was supposed to dock in Miami sailed to the Bahamas instead after a U.S. judge granted an order to seize the vessel as part of a lawsuit over unpaid fuel.

Cruise trackers show Crystal Symphony currently docked in the Bahamian island of Bimini.

Passengers were taken by ferry to Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale on Sunday.

""We all feel we were abducted by luxurious pirates!"" passenger Stephen Heard Fales posted on Facebook.

It was unclear how many passengers were aboard, with one news outlet reporting 300 and another, 700. According to the company website, the vessel can carry up to 848 passengers.

Crystal Symphony and Crystal Serenity at Sea Business Wire

The ship was scheduled to land in Miami on Saturday. But a federal judge in Miami issued an arrest warrant for the ship on Thursday, a maritime practice where a U.S. Marshal goes aboard the vessel and takes charge of it once it enters U.S. waters.

Passengers and entertainers said on social media they were surprised to find out about the legal case. One guest posted a letter on Facebook from Crystal Cruises Management that said the change in itinerary was due to ""non-technical operational issues.""

The lawsuit was filed in a Miami federal court by Peninsula Petroleum Far East against the ship under a maritime procedure that allows actions against vessels for unpaid debts. The complaint says Crystal Symphony was chartered or managed by Crystal Cruises and Star Cruises, which are both sued for breach of contract for owing $4.6 million in fuel.

Crystal Cruises announced earlier this week that it was suspending operations through late April. Besides Crystal Symphony, it has two other ships currently cruising, which end their voyages on January 30 in Aruba and on February 4 in Argentina.

""Suspending operations will provide Crystal's management team with an opportunity to evaluate the current state of business and examine various options moving forward,"" said the company in a statement earlier this week."
Johnny Depp claims Amber Heard or her friend pooped on his bed,https://www.marca.com/en/lifestyle/celebrities/2022/04/19/625ed759e2704e03858b45b9.html,nottheonion,"When Johnny Depp takes the stand in the defamation case against ex-wife Amber Heard on Tuesday, April 19, he is expected to discuss the infamous pooping incident. Depp has accused Heard or a friend of hers of defecating on his side of the bed as part of a revenge act.

Depp is suing his ex-wife Heard, alleging that she painted him as an abuser in an open letter she wrote in 2018. While Heard did not name her ex-husband in the Washington Post opinion piece, his legal team has claimed that it harmed his career and cost him several acting roles. Depp is suing Heard for $50 million in damages, while Heard has counterclaimed for $100 million in defamation.

On April 22, 2016, Heard hosted her 30th birthday party at their downtown Los Angeles penthouse. Depp reportedly arrived late and decided not to attend the party, which enraged his ex-wife, according to reports.

Heard has claimed that Depp threw a magnum wine bottle at her before leaving the house, which he denies. However, the next morning, Depp's housekeeper called him to tell him that someone had defecated on his side of the bed and then covered it with the sheets.

Depp is certain that Heard or one of her friends is to blame for the heinous crime. Heard claims that one of their Yorkshire terriers, Pistol and Boo, had an incontinence episode, but Depp claims that the poop was too big for a 3- or 4-pound dog to excrete. The pooping incident, he later said, was the ""final straw"" in their marriage.

The thing that finally broke their marriage

The sick stunt was a ""fitting end to their relationship,"" according to Depp. The actress tore up and denied she was responsible during a previous trial in London's High Court.

""That is unimaginable to me,"" she said before claiming that one of their teacup terriers had gotten into a fight. Depp admitted that he laughed at the ""absurd"" incident at first, but that he soon realized the marriage couldn't be saved.

""I wanted nothing to do with her,"" Depp said, adding that he tried to make the separation amicable. A text message he sent Heard was read in court, with Depp writing, ""All my love and regrets ... I wish you nothing but good.""

Johnny filed a defamation suit against a British publication in England, but lost the case. They called him a wife beater, and the judge agreed that the charge was ""substantially true."" The current trial is taking place in Virginia, so it will be interesting to see if he has a better outcome this time."
Florida once again has giant calamitous snails that spew parasitic brain worms,https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/07/florida-battling-giant-savage-snails-that-spread-brain-invading-worms-again/,nottheonion,"Officials in Florida are again battling a highly invasive, extraordinarily destructive giant snail species that also happens to be capable of spreading parasitic worms that invade human brains.

The giant African land snail (GALS)—aka Lissachatina fulica—can grow up to 20 centimeters (8 inches) long and is considered ""one of the most invasive pests on the planet,"" according to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. It ravenously feasts on over 500 plant species—including many valuable fruits, vegetables, and ornamentals—while prolifically spawning, pushing out several thousand eggs in its multiyear life span.

In late June, Florida state officials confirmed the presence of GALS on a property in Pasco County, on the west-central coast of the state, just north of Tampa. They have since set up a quarantine zone around the property and began snail-killing pesticide treatments last week.

While the snails are a grave threat to agriculture and natural vegetation in the state, the invasive mollusks also pose a health risk. They're known to transmit rat lungworm parasites, which can invade the human central nervous system and cause a type of meningitis. For this reason, officials warn people not to handle the mammoth snails without gloves.

Brain invasion

You may recall that rat lungworm made headlines a few years ago when Hawaii's health department tallied more than a dozen cases in 2018 and 2019. In 2018, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also published data on several unconnected cases from eight continental states between 2011 and 2017, suggesting a widespread presence.

The rat lungworm—aka Angiostrongylus cantonensis—primarily infects the lungs of rats and other rodents. In the lungs, adult worms mate and females lay eggs, which develop into larvae. The rats then cough up those young parasites and end up swallowing them, then pooping them out.

From those laden logs, the larvae infect snails and slugs (intermediate hosts), via burrowing into their soft bodies or the mollusks feasting on infected feces. In the last steps of this gut-turning life cycle, rats nosh on the infected snails and slugs, delivering late-stage larvae that migrate from the rodents' stomachs to their brains, where the worms develop into young adults. Those mature worms then migrate back to the rats' lungs for breezy breeding time.

Humans are accidental hosts in this cycle. People pick up an infection by eating undercooked snails or slugs; eating fruits and vegetables contaminated by infected snails or slugs; or eating undercooked animals that may have eaten snails and slugs, such as frogs or crabs. Just like in rats, when the worms are ingested by humans, they make their way to the central nervous system.

Third eradication effort

But, in humans, they don't generally make it out. They die in the central nervous system somewhere. Sometimes, this results in a symptomless infection—the worms die quietly and no treatment is needed. In other cases, the worms wriggle through the brain, wreaking havoc before kicking the bucket and causing a wide range of symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, neck stiffness, eye problems, abnormal sensations in the arms and legs, and headaches that are often global and severe, according to the CDC. Severe cases can lead to nerve damage, paralysis, coma, and death.

For all of the above reasons, officials in Florida are eager to stamp out these slimy scourges. But, it's sadly not the first time Florida has battled the mollusks. Giant African land snails were declared eradicated from the state in 1975 and again in 2021. They were initially thought to be introduced to Florida in the 1960s when a child brought three back from Hawaii as pets, which were eventually released into the wild. It's unclear how they were brought back more recently, but some believe they may have hitched rides on cargo or were brought into the state by religious groups for use in healing rituals."
Conservative dating site backed by Peter Thiel announces launch next month,https://thehill.com/policy/technology/3596598-conservative-dating-site-backed-by-peter-thiel-announces-launch-next-month/,nottheonion,"A dating app for conservatives called The Right Stuff will launch next month, seeking to open up a new door for the political right who hope to find more like-minded people in the romantic world.

The upcoming debut was announced in a video featuring Ryann McEnany, the younger sister of former Trump White House secretary Kayleigh McEnany.

The Right Stuff is a free application but can be accessed by invite only, according to the promotional video. Moreover, female users can achieve a premium subscription service on The Right Stuff by inviting other people onto the app.

McEnany added, however, that “male” and “female” would be the only gender identity options users can select on the app, meaning those who identify as transgender, nonbinary or another gender identification would not be accepted.

“The Right Stuff is all about getting into the right dating pool with people who share the same values as you,” McEnany said in the announcement video. “We’re sorry that you’ve had to endure years of bad dates and wasted time with people who don’t see the world our way. The right way.”

The Right Stuff will be in competition with popular dating apps such as Tinder, Bumble and Hinge, services that conservatives often complain cater to the left more than the right.

Tinder, for example, has rolled out numerous changes since the pandemic, including allowing users to post their COVID-19 vaccination status or affirm they support abortion rights, updates that have roiled some conservatives.

The new dating service will also have to fare better than other conservative dating apps that have failed or largely gone unnoticed in the past, including DonaldDaters.

The Hill wrote about The Right Stuff in detail in July, noting the app was created by former Trump White House staffers and is backed by conservative tech billionaire Peter Thiel, who has invested $1.5 million into the app.

Daniel Huff, who served in the Trump administration in the Department of Housing and Urban Development, told The Hill that The Right Stuff “has really not been done before.”

“It’s an important, underserved market,” Huff said. “Liberals own the education, media corporations, and we can’t let them control our personal relationships.”

The Right Stuff could face some backlash for the exclusion of the transgender community. The app is also currently focused on heterosexual relationships, Huff said, but added it may expand to accept same-sex relationships in the future.

The website appeals to young conservatives, displaying messages advertising the ability to “connect with people who aren’t offended by everything,” and to “view profiles without pronouns.”

McEnany said users will have more unrestricted access than Tinder and Bumble, which block who you can see that liked you without a premium subscription. Users can immediately see who liked their profile and connect with them."

"Bono Says He’s “Embarrassed” By Most U2 Songs, Only “Recently” Learned to Sing",https://consequence.net/2022/01/bono-embarrassed-u2-songs-recently-learned-to-sing/,nottheonion,"Can someone check on Bono? The lead singer of U2 recently gave a massively depressed interview, telling the Awards Chatter podcast that he hates the band’s name, is “embarrassed” by most of their songs, and only “recently” learned to sing.

Via The Times, the 61-year-old singer admitted that he “still” doesn’t like the name U2. “I really don’t,” he said. “But I was late into some kind of dyslexia. I didn’t realize that The Beatles was a bad pun either.”

He added that, “In our head it was like the spy plane, U-boat, it was futuristic — as it turned out to imply this kind of acquiescence, no I don’t like that name. I still don’t really like the name.” However, “Paul McGuinness, our first manager, did say, ‘Look, it’s a great name, it’s going to look good on a T-shirt, a letter and a number.’”

When it comes to U2’s chart-topping discography, Bono would rather not revisit it. “I’ve been in the car when one of our songs has come on the radio and I’ve been the color of, as we say in Dublin, scarlet. I’m just so embarrassed.” He added that “the band sound incredible,” but the problem is his “Irish macho” voice, which comes across as “strained.”

“The one that I can listen to the most is Miss Sarajevo with Luciano Pavarotti,” he said. “Genuine, most of the other ones make me cringe a little bit. Although Vertigo probably is the one I’m proudest of. It’s the way it connects with the crowd.”

He especially hated his voice upon hearing Joey Ramone. “The big discovery for me was listening to The Ramones and hearing the beautiful kind of sound of Joey Ramone and realizing I didn’t have to be that rock and roll singer.”

Bono added, “I only became a singer like recently, maybe it hasn’t happened yet for some people’s ears and I understand that.”

It certainly hadn’t happened on the band’s contribution to Sing 2, “Your Song Saved My Life,” which was perhaps one of the worst songs of 2021. However, that didn’t stop the track from being shortlisted for an Oscar. Last May, Bono guested on DMX’s posthumous album Exodus."

""For the first time, this generation is going to go into a store and not be able to get what they want,"" Kapito said, adding: ""We have a very entitled generation that has never had to sacrifice.""

He warned that people who have grown accustomed to having everything available to them at the supermarket would soon face ""scarcity inflation.""

""I would put on your seat belts because this is something that we haven’t seen,"" he said.

Kapito, who according to some estimates has a net worth of at least $485 million, made the comments at the Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association in Austin, Texas. It wasn’t exactly clear which ""entitled generation"" he was referring to.

Kapito’s comments were first reported by Bloomberg.

Consumer inflation, propelled by surging costs for gas, food, and housing, jumped nearly 8% over the past year – the sharpest spike in 40 years.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 has pushed already-soaring prices even farther and supply chains, disrupted by the swift recovery from the pandemic recession, face renewed pressure.

(Nelvin C. Cepeda/The San Diego Union-Tribune via AP)

DEL MAR, Calif. (AP) — California Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed Friday letting private citizens in his state sue gun makers to stop them from selling assault weapons just as Texas lets its residents sue abortion providers to stop the procedures, then essentially dared the U.S. Supreme Court to treat both issues the same.

At a news conference in the coastal town of Del Mar, north of San Diego, Newsom said he thought the Texas law was wrong and the Supreme Court’s decision in December to let it stay in effect while it’s appealed was “absurd” and “outrageous.”

“But they opened up the door. They set the tone, tenor, the rules. And either we can be on the defense complaining about it or we can play by those rules. We are going to play by those rules,” Newsom said. He later added: “We’ll see how principled the U.S. Supreme Court is.”

The unique Texas law, approved last year, bans all abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected, usually around the sixth week of pregnancy. The law does not let the government enforce it. Instead, private citizens can sue abortion providers or anyone who “aids and abets” the procedure.

The theory is that because the government can’t enforce the law, then abortion advocates can’t sue the state to block it. That makes it much harder to challenge in court.

A bill in the California Legislature unveiled Friday would do the same thing. But instead of abortion providers, it would let people sue gun-makers and others who sell, make or distribute assault-style guns in the state.

California has banned the sale and manufacture of many assault-style guns for decades. But last year, U.S. District Judge Roger Benitez overturned that law, ruling it was unconstitutional while comparing an AR-15 rifle to a Swiss Army knife as “good for both home and battle.” The ruling incensed Newsom and he vowed to fight back.

California’s proposed legislation is exactly what gun rights groups feared would happen if the Supreme Court allowed the Texas law to stay in effect. That’s why the Firearms Policy Coalition opposed that law at the high court. The group said Friday it would go to court if necessary to block the California proposal.

The restrictions, the group said, are “really just modern-day Jim Crow laws designed to suppress the exercise of human rights the tyrants who run California don’t like.”

Newsom and his Democratic allies in the state Legislature are convinced the U.S. Supreme Court would have to uphold their gun proposal if it allows the Texas abortion law to stand. But it might not be that simple.

The U.S. Constitution specifically says people have a right to bear arms, and the Supreme Court has interpreted that broadly. The right to an abortion is not specifically protected in the Constitution. But the court has recognized lots of other protections that aren’t explicitly stated in the Constitution.

Melissa Murray, a law professor at New York University, said she believed if the conservative court majority could find a way to distinguish between the Texas law and the California proposal, they will.

“I think it will be a real test of this court’s principles about how they regard a law like that that basically does exactly what (the Texas law) did only in the context of assault weapons,” she said.

California law defines assault weapons as semiautomatic rifles or pistols that have a variety of functions. The bill would let people seek a court order to stop the spread of these weapons and recover a minimum of $10,000 in damages for each weapon, plus attorney’s fees.

California’s bill, authored by Democratic state Sen. Bob Hertzberg, is not yet available on the state’s website. But a fact sheet provided by Hertzberg’s office said the bill would apply to those who manufacture, distribute, transport, import into California, or sell assault weapons, .50 BMG rifles or “ghost guns” — untraceable weapons that can be bought online and assembled at home.

Sam Paredes, executive director of Gun Owners of California, said he believed the bill’s true purpose is to ban guns altogether in California.

“There’s no question that it would put some of the smaller mom-and-pop gun stores out of business if they were challenged in court. They don’t have the resources to defend themselves, even if they are not guilty,” he said. “This will have a huge chilling effect, and that’s their intent.”

The bill is one of four pieces of legislation targeting the gun industry in California. The other bills would make it illegal to market assault weapons to children, crack down on ghost guns and make it easier for people to sue gun manufacturers for liability in shootings.

Earlier this week the families of nine victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut announced they have agreed to a $73 million settlement of a lawsuit against Remington , the maker of the rifle used to kill 20 first-graders and six educators in 2012. The case was watched because of its potential to provide a roadmap for victims of other shootings to sue firearm-makers.

California Democratic Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, introduced AB 2571, which would limit the type of firearms advertising and marketing that can be geared toward children. She and Newsom said the gun industry is using social media and children’s books, mascots, apparel and guns decorated to appeal to kids.

They specifically criticized a company called Wee1 Tactical, which markets the JR-15, patterned after the popular adult AR-15 assault-style semi-automatic rifle.

The company’s website says its goal is to “safely help adults introduce children to the shooting sports.” The company’s logo is a skull sucking on a baby pacifier and it is on hats, shirts, patches and stickers.

“How the hell did they think that’s OK?” Newsom asked.

The company did not immediately respond to a telephone message and email seeking comment.

Dramatic dash came footage, which state police released Thursday, shows the June 14 incident.

In the video, two troopers attempt to arrest the son, identified by WCAX as 24-year-old Brandon Tallman, who was wanted on assault and burglary charges. While responding to his parents' house in Hardwick, they ""suddenly found themselves in an unexpected and dangerous situation,"" state police said in a post on Facebook.

Last week, two of our troopers found themselves in an unexpected and dangerous situation when they went to a home in Hardwick to arrest a suspect in an assault and burglary case. The suspect's parents attempted to hinder the arrest, and ultimately the suspect's father menaced and attempted to assault the troopers using an excavator. Thankfully, the troopers were unharmed and able to arrest all the parties involved without any injuries. One of our commanders said later: ""They don’t have a scenario at the academy where we practice this one."" Posted by Vermont State Police on Thursday, June 23, 2022

Tallman's mother appears to interfere with the arrest, refusing to let go of her son and scuffling with officers as they attempted to handcuff him.

Meanwhile, his father gets behind the wheel of an excavator parked in the driveway and ""menaced and attempted to assault"" the troopers with the construction equipment, state police said.

Ultimately the troopers were able to arrest all three without injuries, state police said. WCAX identified the mother as Amy Tallman and the father as Wayne Tallman, 52.

Wayne Tallman was charged with reckless endangerment and assault on a protected official, while Amy Tallman faces charges for impeding an officer, WCAX reported.

Disney CEO doesn't believe animation is for adults,https://www.unilad.com/film-and-tv/disney-ceo-animation-adults-20221027?source=facebook,nottheonion,"The classic Disney films are beloved by children and adults alike, but that hasn't stopped the CEO of the House of Mouse sticking his neck out and saying animated films are strictly for kids.

In a recent interview, the CEO of Disney made the bizarre claim that animation isn't for adults.

Disney is known for some of the most popular animated movies of all time, including The Lion King and Frozen, and even The Simpsons - which has a popular adult fan base.

Advert 10

Loading…

Bob Chapek, who has been in post since 2020 after replacing Bob Iger, discussed animation on Wall Street Journal’s Tech Live conference on Wednesday (26 October).

He made the point that despite its child-friendly image, Disney shouldn't be afraid of producing more adult-orientated content too.

One recent example of this was when Disney+'s Pam and Tommy featured a talking penis, which isn't exactly what you expect to see when tuning into a Disney show.

Advert 10

Chapek said: ""I always say that when our fans and our audiences put their kids to bed at night after watching Pinocchio, or Dumbo or Little Mermaid, they're probably not going to tune into another animated movie. They want something for them.

""I want to respect legacy and what this brand is, but at the same time, I know that we may be even more precious about what's Disney than the consumer base.

Advert 10

One fan said: ""Well that's just a terrible take.""

Another added: ""Bro’s living in 1990.""

A fellow angry fan replied: ""More like 1925. Even back in the '60s, shows like The Flintstones pandered to the adult crowd. It is ignorant to suggest that cartoons are solely for children.""

A fourth added: ""How could the CEO of freaking Disney have such an awful take.""

Chapek's comments don't seem to have gone down well with Disney fans, however, the CEO said in the same interview that he doesn't prioritise his own feelings when making big decisions at the entertainment giant.

He said: ""My own personal feelings aren’t really important. What’s important is how people think about our company, and so I take myself out of it.

""And I think that’s sort of the surprise, is everybody sort of wants to be loved and everybody wants everyone to like them.

""But in this in this world, that’s not always necessary, so I wash all that away and say, ‘What do we want the ‘capital D’ Disney Company to stand for?’"

Musk's father confirms baby with stepdaughter,https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/celebrities/news/a19590355/elon-musks-father-confirms-baby-with-stepdaughter/,nottheonion,"Elon Musk's estranged father Errol Musk has confirmed that he has welcomed a baby with his stepdaughter Jana Bezuidenhout.

Errol - an entrepreneurial engineer and former emerald dealer who lives in South Africa where Elon was raised - married Jana's mother Heide when Jana was just four.

The couple were married for 18 years, and have two children together.

However, Errol, 72, said he didn't consider 30-year-old Jana as his stepdaughter because, despite marrying her mother when she was a small child, she was raised away from him for long periods of time, according to The Sunday Times.

Musk senior also suggested that it was ""God's plan"" that led him to having a child with Jana, who reportedly got in touch with him after splitting from her boyfriend.

""We were lonely, lost people,"" Errol told The Sunday Times. ""One thing led to another - you can call it God's plan or nature's plan.""

When Jana called Errol two months later to say she was pregnant, Errol requested a DNA test to confirm that he was the father.

""Jana is a delightful girl and a wonderful mother. She said I had changed her life,"" he added.

He also described their 10-month-old son as an ""exquisite child"". Musk doesn't live with Jana and their son Eliot Rush, but is helping to support them.



According to the Mail Online, Errol initially told his daughter Ali about their new baby, but she was upset by the news and called him ""insane, mentally ill"".

""She told the others and they went berserk,"" Errol disclosed to the Mail Online.

Last year, 46-year-old billionaire tech tycoon Elon broke down in tears during an interview with Rolling Stone, during which he professed that his father was a ""terrible human being"".

Elon - cofounder of PayPal, Tesla Motors, and SpaceX - added that Errol was guilty of ""almost every crime you can possibly think of"", and had done ""almost every evil thing you could possibly think of"".

""My dad will have a carefully thought-out plan of evil,"" he added to the publication. ""He will plan evil.""



Errol denied his son's comments and said that he had never intentionally hurt or threatened anyone, or been charged with anything except for an incident when he shot dead three armed people who broke into his home.

He was later cleared of all charges on the grounds of self-defence.

Errol and Elon's mother Maye - a successful model and dietician - divorced when he was ten. It's claimed that father and son have not spoken for more than a year.

Meanwhile, Elon has six children from his former eight-year marriage to Canadian author Justine Musk. He married English actress Talulah Riley in 2010 before divorcing two years later, only to remarry in 2013. They divorced again in 2016.

Elon recently split from Hollywood star Amber Heard after dating on and off for a year."
Rep. Cawthorn channels 'great philosopher' Toby Keith during Congressional speech,https://www.cbs17.com/news/political-news/rep-cawthorn-channels-great-philosopher-toby-keith-during-congressional-speech/,nottheonion,"WASHINGTON (WNCN) – Rep. Madison Cawthorn (NC-11) delivered a message before Congress Wednesday that even some of his biggest critics might agree with, at least in part: that the United States should be careful in considering the prospect of going to war.

In doing so, the representative from western North Carolina channeled country artist Toby Keith, who he called a “great philosopher.”

“As the great philosopher Toby Keith once said, ‘We put a boot in their ass. It’s the American way,” Cawthorn began. The line is a quote from Keith’s 2002 song “Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue.”

One of Cawthorn’s arguments was that lawmakers and leaders must “define what victory looks like” when declaring war, adding that “the sons and daughters of America are too precious to waste.”

He also argued that Congress’ responsibility for declaring war, as granted by Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, has been whittled away.

“Overzealous executives have wrenched away a precious power bestowed upon this body (Congress),” he said. “I am here to remind them Congress declares war, not Joe Biden, not some woke general. Congress.”

To that point, Congress has, in fact, approved all 11 declarations for war in American history. The first was against Great Britain in 1812. The three most recent were against Bulgaria, Hungary, and Rumania in June 1942.

However, Congress and the president have also enacted authorizations of the use of force as opposed to formal declarations of war. It does not create a state of war under international law. These declarations have been largely unused since World War II. Laws of war like the Geneva and Hague Conventions apply to armed conflicts, whether or not a formal declaration or authorization was issued, according to the Congressional Research Service.

The last successful authorization of use of force was made against Iraq in 2002. Another against Syria in 2013 was not enacted into law."
A woman is speaking out against critics of Disney adults after she was bullied online for crying while hugging Goofy,https://www.insider.com/woman-who-cried-while-meeting-goofy-interview-2022-5,nottheonion,"Sarah Rachul is a 28-year-old Disney fan who went viral for crying while hugging Goofy.

Though fellow Disney fans supported her, others online sent her intense criticism.

Rachul spoke with Insider about the hug, her family's connection to Disney, and cyberbullying.

When 28-year-old Sarah Rachul sees Goofy, she's immediately reminded of her grandfather.

""Goofy was never my favorite character, Tinkerbell was, but he became my favorite after my grandpa died,"" she told Insider. ""He was my papa's favorite and he loved interacting with Goofy at the parks. I have really nice photos of them together.""

So when she had the chance to hug the character at Disney World for the first time since the pandemic started, Rachul quickly became emotional.

Her mom captured a video of their interaction, where Rachul is seen with a surprised reaction before breaking down into tears. She then runs over to Goofy, who's standing with open arms, and embraces him. The clip has nearly 2 million views as of Saturday.

But after posting the footage, Rachul's sweet moment turned sour. Countless commenters harshly criticized her emotional reaction, saying she ""should be embarrassed"" and ""get help.""

The Ohio native told Insider she grew up visiting Disney World with her family

They often went multiple times per year, with their most recent trip in early May.

""I saw Disney's TikTok teasing that they were going to bring back these interactions, which has been something I've missed very, very much, and I immediately started crying. It was foreshadowing I guess,"" she joked.

She started preparing weeks in advance, purchasing a Goofy-inspired headband from Etsy and hunting down a hard-to-find, vintage Goofy T-shirt.

And on the first day of the trip, her family went straight to Epcot and were the first people in the meet-and-greet line.

Rachul said she felt calm at first, but quickly turned emotional and started crying when Goofy rounded the corner.

""I was standing there a little frozen because I was like, 'Oh my God, this poor person just started their shift and this is what they have to deal with at 9 a.m.,'"" she said. ""But it felt like a small string that had been connecting me to my papa that was snipped because of COVID had been retied.""

A post shared by Sarah | Lifelong Mouseketeer (@everydayisdisney_)

Because she works in public relations, Rachul said she knew the video of their interaction had the potential to go viral.

But what she didn't expect was for TikTok's algorithm to push the clip to non-Disney fans, many of whom left hateful comments. While Rachul said she wasn't offended by most of them, she was alarmed.

""A few of the comments I deleted. They were outright vile,"" she said. ""Others were well written but so cruel, like, 'I urge you to seek therapy for what seems to be a very aggressive mental-health problem.'""

She later addressed the criticism in a second TikTok video, and urged others to speak out against cyberbullying.

""It's not about me,"" she told Insider. ""It's the fact that there are teenagers who think it's appropriate to suggest a stranger should go to therapy when they don't know that stranger's history with mental health. ""

'Disney adults' often face particularly intense backlash online

Grown Disney fans are often described as ""weird"" and ""immature,"" with some of the criticism extending offline, as Disney fans previously told Insider.

Rachul said she's experienced those criticisms before. She said there's an assumption that they ""don't have adult interests,"" and a misconception that Disney adults all ""live in their parents' basement,"" which she says is ironic because she owns a home.

Even those who defend Disney adults, in Rachul's experience, have misconceptions about the fandom.

""Sometimes they say, 'All Disney adults experience severe childhood trauma, so this is them trying to reclaim it,'"" she said. ""I just want to be very clear: I had a lovely childhood, as did many of my friends who are Disney influencers.""

""The reason I think so many people hate Disney adults is seen in my comment section. People who say, 'Wow I wish I could be this happy.'"" she said. ""We are so secure in who we are and what we like. It pisses people off because they want to be like that and they can't.""

Disney Adults often face intense backlash from non-Disney fans online. Sarah Rachul

In Rachul's experience, the Disney community itself has been the exact opposite, providing nothing but love and support to other fans.

That's one reason why she's eager to speak out against cyberbullying, and to also encourage other Disney adults to express themselves freely.

""I was angry seeing people write, 'This is why I'm afraid to go to Disney, I don't want to be judged,'"" she said. ""To those people I'd say, make the account, follow Disney influencers and fans, and fill your feed with people who share the same passion as you and interact with them.""

Despite the backlash she faced, Rachul remembers her Goofy hug fondly, largely thanks to Disney employees.

""It was the best character hug I've ever gotten. I can cry thinking about it,"" she said. ""All I could think about was how my papa was my absolute best friend in the world. I was homeschooled and he lived with us, so there was never a moment we weren't together. Goofy could tell I needed some kind of comfort at that moment.""

""I know the Disney cast members also got a lot of hateful comments from my video — like people implying they hate their jobs — but I just want to thank the ones who were involved,"" she said. ""They never made me feel like I didn't deserve a magical character interaction because I'm an adult."""

Seriously, none of it matters to us. I don’t know how to make it any clearer. We simply couldn’t care less.” At press time, McConnell had returned to the podium to add that his thoughts and prayers were, of course, with the community and the grieving families.

Ted Cruz Decries Voting Rights Bill As Shameless Power Grab By American People To Control Country,https://www.theonion.com/ted-cruz-decries-voting-rights-bill-as-shameless-power-1846553352,TheOnion,"WASHINGTON—Calling the proposed law “dangerous” and “unprecedented”, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) decried a new voting rights bill Thursday as a shameless power grab by the American people to control the country. “The proposed legislation is nothing more than a brazen attempt by the calculating American people to seize congress by electing representatives,” said Cruz, who warned that the nation’s 328 million residents “would stop at nothing” to carry out their sinister ploy . “There’s no way the U.S. population would be pushing for voting rights if it didn’t mean there was something to be gained. It’s a transparent attempt to drive Republicans out of power by allowing Americans who have opinions contrary to our own to vote against us, and we won’t stand for it. Clearly, the American people are way out of touch with the GOP.” At press time, Cruz had raised concerns the bill would lead to a wave of non-senators casting ballots.

Report: Queen Elizabeth Shot Herself In Bunker As Enemy Forces Closed In,https://www.theonion.com/report-queen-elizabeth-shot-herself-in-bunker-as-enemy-1849518166,TheOnion,"BALLATER, SCOTLAND—Ruling her official cause of death as suicide, sources confirmed Friday that Queen Elizabeth II shot herself in her bunker with her service pistol as enemy forces closed in. “Rather than surrender, Queen Elizabeth died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head,” said sources, who shared that the queen’s body had been dragged out from her subterranean shelter at Balmoral Castle to the garden, where a servant burned and buried the queen’s body alongside those of her beloved pet corgis, which had been force-fed cyanide capsules. “As it became clear she could not win, she turned to her only option. Though she fought long and hard, the queen was terrified of being taken alive. A long, humiliating, and painful trial awaited her, and she wanted to ensure that she went out on her own terms rather than dying in prison.” At press time, sources added the queen’s suicide was partly motivated by fear she would be strung up by her heels in the streets, as had happened only days earlier with Joe Biden.

Elon Musk To Cut Twitter Staff To Single Devoted Hunchback Who Laughs Hysterically At All Of Boss’s Genius Tweets,https://www.theonion.com/elon-musk-to-cut-twitter-staff-to-single-devoted-hunchb-1849688103,TheOnion,"AUSTIN—Following a meeting with investors, reports surfaced Friday alleging that business magnate Elon Musk’s purchase of Twitter would include cutting the current staff down to a single devoted hunchback who laughs hysterically at all of his boss’s brilliant tweets.

Insiders confirmed that Musk planned to immediately reduce Twitter’s 7,500 employees down to a “skeleton staff” of a single loyal hunchback, who would occasionally scuttle out from the darkness to maniacally cackle at the boss’s “fire” social media posts and hiss a strained “based, sire” before the light of the computer burned his translucent skin.

According to sources, the gnarled creature, whose sole task would be hobbling down from the Twitter HQ bell tower every 15 minutes to clap and jig with glee at Musk’s online antics, preliminarily agreed to a significant salary cut in favor of being paid with a single gold coin that he could keep in a small leather sack.

Despite concerns that reducing the staff to a lone, faithful hunchback who frequently mutters “your meme game is tight, master” whenever the tech billionaire posts was risky to the security and functionality of the social media site, Musk assured investors that the move would drastically scale down back -end expenses.

Musk also reportedly signaled that the hunchback would mark a turning point in Twitter company culture, noting that any and all employees hired after the acquisition would be brought aboard only to fill out the choir of voices chanting “L-M-A-O” from an open pit beneath his office.

At press time, Musk had reportedly impregnated the hunchback."

It’ll boost voter turnout and help folks rally around the DNC platform. Hell, even if I’m not restored to the Oval Office, it will help me personally and financially.

Study: 83% Of Gamblers Quit Right Before They Would Have Hit The Big One,https://www.theonion.com/study-83-of-gamblers-quit-right-before-they-would-hav-1819575092,TheOnion,"WASHINGTON—According to a study published Monday in the Journal Of Financial Economics, 83 percent of gamblers quit right before hitting the jackpot and striking it rich.

Lead researcher, Dr. Richard Howe of the University of Chicago, confirmed that 83 percent of gamblers recklessly opted to walk away from blackjack tables, slot machines, roulette wheels, and other games of chance, when they were just one big bet away from winning a massive fortune.

“Our research revealed that the vast majority of gamblers who chose not to continue wagering their money on games of chance would have, in fact, hit the big one on the very next try,” said Howe, who analyzed over 5,000 casual to heavy gamblers for the study. “This was equally true for beginners who quit playing slots after their very first visit to a casino and for high rollers who gave up gambling altogether to avoid financial ruin.”

“These people weren’t only quitters, they were downright fools,” added Howe. “Statistics repeatedly showed that if they had just reached into their wallets one more time, these men and women would have been set for life with more than enough money to pay down debts, create trust funds for their children, and retire from their jobs in ease and comfort.”

Howe told reporters that the majority of gamblers prematurely, and unwisely, choose to stop gambling due to fears of jeopardizing personal relationships, thereby sabotaging any chance at scoring the big bonanza that awaits them on the very next deal. In addition, researchers said that players cleaned up 100 percent of the time when they continued to place bets and ignored any lingering anxieties about accruing insurmountable debt or destroying their kids’ college funds.

The study, which analyzed data collected from major casinos across the country, confirmed that the moment a gambler becomes exasperated and realizes they can’t continue throwing money away is precisely when they should double down and desperately dip into retirement accounts, drain the cash value from life insurance policies, or pawn prized family heirlooms.

Professor James Gordon, who co-authored the study, said that most gamblers make rash decisions to walk away from an electronic gaming device or craps table after losing their last dollar, failing to realize that the odds are overwhelmingly in their favor if they simply overdraft their savings account just one more time.

“What gamblers as a whole need to realize is that, statistically speaking, their fear of going bust is ludicrous and absurd, and they really need to just go for it, and go for it hard—I’m talking all in here,” said Gordon, adding that gamblers could maintain control over their destiny and hit the big one much faster by increasing the frequency and monetary value of wagers. “Because the payoff is just tremendous. Hell, our research shows they’re walking away from the table right when they stand to make millions. Don’t they want to be rich?”

Gibson also reportedly remains wholly ignorant of the fact that his behavior this past Christmas, which included shrieking for 10 straight minutes after not getting a cookie, was directly responsible for his aunt and uncle’s choice to never procreate, or that stories about staying up all night to take care of him are why one of his father’s coworkers and her husband determined that they would be fine with just a dog.

Texas Bans Consensual Sex,https://www.theonion.com/texas-bans-consensual-sex-1848631845,TheOnion,"AUSTIN, TX—Joined by Republicans from the state legislature in a highly publicized ceremony, Texas governor Greg Abbott signed a law Thursday banning consensual sex. “I’m proud to sign this bill into law today making all consensual sexual acts punishable by a minimum of 10 years in prison,” said Abbott, who was applauded by religious and other right-wing interest groups for standing up for traditional family values. “Consensual sex has always been immoral, and now it’s finally illegal, too. Enthusiastic, continuous, specific, freely given, and clearly communicated sexual consent will not be tolerated in Texas. Any person who sets up two friends on a date who then go on to have a consensual sexual relationship will also be held responsible and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.” At press time, the U.S. Supreme Court had issued a ruling declining to block the new law.

Despite his countless legislative wins, many so-called Democrats would rather see one of the best public servants in modern American history pack his bags, leave the White House, and retire. Well, to them I say: You could not be more wrong. Joe Biden deserves four more years of making my centrist baby boomer pussy sopping wet.



Sorry, Bernie Bros. I’m a 67-year-old lifelong Democrat; my vagina is absolutely saturated with thick, hot clam sauce from the mere thought of a second Joe Biden term; and there’s absolutely nothing you can do about it.

That’s right. Even just mentioning Joe Biden and his moderate agenda has awakened within the very depths of my loins a hot, bubbling spring of freshly squeezed, unpasteurized pussy nectar. From the day he was elected, Joe Biden got to work fixing America, and just thinking about it, as I type, is conjuring forth a geyser of juices so powerful it’s all but melted a gaping hole in my high-waisted granny panties.

Right now I’m sitting in a pool of my own boiling hot crotch broth reflecting on all the civility, respect, and compromise Joe Biden has brought back to Washington. The fact that he’s willing to talk to Republicans, be their friends, and actually hear them out is enough to flood my basement with so much lady sludge that, let’s just say, I’ll definitely be ripping out the carpet.

In 2024, we will need Joe Biden to “Build Back Better,” because this torrent of poon juice exploding from my aging snapper is going to cause serious damage to our great country.



Start stacking sandbags, people. There’s a deadly blue wave forming right between this loyal, Occupy Democrats–loving, ActBlue donor’s legs. When Joe Biden reached across the aisle and passed the $3 trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, I should have called in the Coast Guard, because this upper-class, Ivy League–educated liberal’s clam dam is about to burst.

Unfortunately, many Americans are going to drown.

And the best part is, Joe Biden is just getting started. If he runs again in 2024 and starts wearing those aviators, licking ice cream cones, and saying things like “No malarkey,” I might actually pass out. I’m serious. I slid off my chair and am currently lying face down in several inches of my own absolutely putrid female fluids. Lord, help me.

At the end of the day, America needs someone like Joe Biden to heal our divided nation and restore it to a position of respect on the world stage. In 2024, I hope I can march my wet ham to the voting booth, slosh my boomer ass down, and let this baby rip.

So please join me, America. Let’s band together, get Biden into the White House, and drown together in my pussy juices for four more years.

Greg Abbott, who added that the 24-hour waiting period, which would begin the moment dispatchers received their first 911 call, would help police be “100% certain” that protecting the public was prudent. “Before rushing into a school or church to stop a massacre, police will be required to wait a full 24 hours, never acting a minute sooner. They’ll also be subject to mandatory counseling with their peers in the parking lot so they can fully recognize the risks involved with attempting to save lives. We wouldn’t want them to do something in the heat of the moment that they’d regret, like taking out the shooter.” At press time, Abbott added that each additional 911 call authorities received would restart the waiting period.

"This Shooting Isn’t About Gun Control We Refuse To Pass, It’s About Access To Mental Health Care We’re Continuing To Gut",https://www.theonion.com/this-shooting-isn-t-about-gun-control-we-refuse-to-pass-1819585076,TheOnion,"As our nation struggles to come to grips with the horrible tragedy in Las Vegas, it’s only natural for people to search for an explanation of how an atrocity like this could have happened and to call on their elected officials to take measures to prevent such terrible bloodshed from occurring again in the future. Unfortunately, however, we’ve seen enough of these incidents to know that some people will rush to blame firearms for this carnage and will demand that Congress enact sweeping gun restrictions, engaging in misguided efforts that completely miss the underlying reasons behind the violence we’re seeing.

The simple truth is, mass shootings like this aren’t about gun control we refuse to pass. They’re about access to mental health care that we will continue to gut.

Advertisement

You can already hear the calls from the left. In the aftermath of this mass murder, millions of people are once again pushing for an assault weapons ban that I won’t allow lawmakers to give even a moment of consideration, let alone bring to a vote. If these folks actually examined the realities of the issue, they would see that the real culprit in these incidents is, and always has been, our country’s inadequate mental healthcare system that leaves troubled, potentially violent individuals without the support they need, and which my colleagues and I have spent most of our careers seeking, often successfully, to defund.



The reason we have tragedies like this is because of how our healthcare system that I am dead set on undermining fails to serve Americans in desperate need of psychological treatment. Not because of a lack of gun ownership regulations, the slightest toughening of which will never even receive a single second of debate on the floor of the House on my watch.

Advertisement

Case in point, I’ve seen commentators cite the GOP bill to loosen restrictions on silencers that is currently making its way through Congress as contributing to an environment where these shootings will continue to occur, an erroneous line of reasoning that completely ignores how our party’s many active attempts to repeal Obamacare would make it significantly harder, if not impossible, for millions of unwell individuals to visit mental health specialists and receive the treatment necessary to keep their erratic behavior in check.

If we as a nation are really serious about preventing future tragedies, we shouldn’t focus on regulating so-called gun sale loopholes and outlawing high-capacity magazines, the very mention of which will elicit an overwhelming and immediate nullifying response should it be breathed on the floor of the House. Instead, we need to pay attention to the fact that many people with treatable mental illnesses struggle to afford medication or therapy, and then work around the clock to ensure that their meager options only dwindle further and become more expensive. That is where we need to be focused as a nation.



Advertisement

If we’re going to get anywhere, we must see this problem for what it truly is: a nationwide mental health crisis that my policies have allowed to metastasize and that I am working continuously to exacerbate. Not some issue of who can and can’t buy guns, all legislation about which I, along with the powerful resources of supportive lobbyists, have suppressed with exceptional efficiency.

Because as easy as it is to blame this unconscionable loss of human life on background check laws designed to maximize the profits of the gun industry at the expense of public safety, the real fault lies with healthcare legislation designed to maximize insurance industry profits at the expense of public safety.

Remember, it’s not guns we’ve deliberately removed all barriers to owning that kill people. It’s people to whom we continually deny basic care that kill people.

Yet more than 11 minutes have now passed since The Onion was banned from Twitter, and the mainstream media has not issued a single statement in our defense.

Without the megaphone of Twitter, The Onion has been effectively silenced, reduced to covering its own digital muzzling merely through periodic messages posted on Twitter about its present condition. Meanwhile, in an act of outrageous cowardice, not one major news network has featured an interview with our publisher emeritus T. Herman Zweibel, nor with his five nonagenarian sons, nor with any of his 147 descendants across five generations, all of whom hold nominal executive positions at The Onion and stand ready to give exclusive comment on this gross curtailment of press freedoms.

Of course, the media has long abdicated its role in informing the masses, yet never in our darkest imaginings did this editorial board conceive of such rank abandonment by its supposed journalistic brothers-in-arms. Yes, they may have trumpeted nonexistent weapons of mass destruction in Iraq or willfully ignored various genocides across the globe, but such examples pale in comparison to the outrageous failures on the part of journalists everywhere to help The Onion in this pivotal moment in world history.

Where is the outrage from opinion columnists who dared call themselves defenders of free speech?

Why has CNN’s Anderson Cooper not vowed to self-immolate if this inexplicable and cruel decision is not reversed?

Perhaps they do not know that this glaring omission will be a black mark on journalism for centuries to come. Perhaps they do not see that the probing eyes of the American public are already upon them, questioning why legacy newspapers everywhere have chosen to so conveniently bury the most notable story in modern media history. Perhaps what seemed like coincidence after five or six minutes now looks more clearly like a conspiracy of news organizations driven by sheer profit-seeking and greed, who sense blood in the water and endeavor to destroy the world’s one remaining media juggernaut.



Where is the conscience of The New York Times? Where are the ethical standards of the newsroom at The Washington Post? “Democracy dies in darkness”? Well, darkness has indeed fallen upon our country today. There is no illumination cast by the wretched ash heaps of avarice who still have the gall to call themselves the free press.

It’s a little sketchy—I heard one of the justices never even went to law school, and another one is only licensed to do animal rights law—but they’re the only ones who are going to help me get rights. All I had to do was show up in the middle of the night and give them $500, and they gave me the judicial rulings I needed. It was a pretty painful way to obtain the right to equality before the law, but in a place like America, I’ll take it.” Sources confirmed that many Americans living near the border were contemplating crossing it to get human rights from a Mexican Supreme Court, while those who couldn’t travel were trying internet searches for a DIY Supreme Court that could give them human rights at home.

Paraphernalia like bookmarks, highlighters, and library cards will be immediately confiscated. And don’t think you can get away with hiding a paperback in your pocket, either.

The Pros And Cons Of Letting Children Die,https://www.theonion.com/the-pros-and-cons-of-letting-children-die-1848983842,TheOnion,"America is currently wrestling with the difficult and controversial question of whether it’s worth it to make an effort to keep children alive, not to mention safe, educated, or healthy. The Onion looks at the pros and cons of just letting children die.



PRO

Raising children too easy without additional stakes

Gives bipartisan congressional leadership something to ignore together

Great fundraising material

Can convert child’s bedroom into exercise room sooner than expected

Less fodder for pedophiles

Way, way easier than trying to not let children die

CON

Waste of a good tax break

Could hurt the football program

Fewer family members to protect with guns

Might sometimes also lose a good kid

Probably bad for economy somehow

No way to watch grandchildren die someday"

7-Year-Old Unable To Maintain Single Cohesive Storyline While Playing With Action Figures,https://www.theonion.com/7-year-old-unable-to-maintain-single-cohesive-storyline-1819578954,TheOnion,"BROCKTON, MA—Saying the plot was jumping all over the place and had become extremely hard to follow, onlookers confirmed this afternoon that 7-year-old Brendan Milner has been unable to maintain a single cohesive storyline while playing with his action figures.

By all accounts, the second-grader failed to adhere to any logical narrative arc, following one plotline for only a brief period of time before veering in wildly tangential directions as he acted out scenes with several of his favorite plastic toys, including the superhero Iron Man, the giant monster Godzilla, and professional wrestler John Cena.

“I’ll get you for that,” said Milner, who violently slammed the figurine of Iron Man into the WWE World Heavyweight Champion toy and sent it flying across the living room, contradicting a scene from just moments earlier in which the pair were best friends searching for a magical crystal. “Nobody beats Iron Man. I have power blasters.”

“Wait. Look out, there’s a bunch of hot lava coming out of a volcano,” added the child, introducing another ill-conceived element into the already disjointed series of events.

Advertisement

Sources confirmed that Milner’s plot started out promisingly, with John Cena and Iron Man teaming up with a triceratops to prevent a giant fireball from destroying the Earth, but noted that within little more than a minute, the storyline started to lose any sense of cohesion. Numerous reports indicated that the group of action figures abruptly abandoned the original mission in order to focus their entire attention on bringing the Star Wars villain Darth Maul to justice, ostensibly leaving the planet in imminent danger.

According to eyewitnesses, the story ultimately became impossible to follow, with a particularly jarring chain of incidents that involved the setting rapidly switching from outer space to beneath the ocean to a mummy’s tomb, all in a matter of seconds.

“Hurry, the bad guys are getting away,” said Milner, flying a Lego Batcopter with one hand while making the Godzilla action figure flip across a couch cushion in pursuit of an entirely unknown adversary whose offenses were never specified. “We captured you. Now you’re in jail.”

Onlookers listed more than a dozen inconsistencies in the child’s playtime activity, as well as a number of perplexing events that seemed to come completely out of nowhere and have no bearing on the storyline whatsoever, including instances in which Milner smashed together the faces of Iron Man and a Barbie doll for several seconds, had the protagonists flee from three Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles figures, and at one point, manipulated the John Cena toy to suplex a Playmobil farmer representing his second-grade classmate Tyler.

Those familiar with the situation also expressed their frustration at Milner’s heavy reliance on bringing dead characters back to life in order to move the plot along, specifically mentioning one gratuitous instance when a number of wooden blocks fell on a Spider-Man toy and killed him, only for the superhero to reappear two minutes later saying, “Follow me.”

Experts who were called upon to analyze the narrative noted that throughout the half hour spent playing with his action figures, the second-grader completely ignored basic elements of storytelling and chose instead to repeatedly introduce new dramatic situations, making the already sprawling and erratic plot even more confusing.

Advertisement

“Not only was the narrative underdeveloped, but the actions never set into motion corresponding consequences,” said Martin Elliott, a professor of creative writing at Princeton University, adding that the 7-year-old relied heavily on the “mentally lazy” plot device deus ex machina by frequently having a Transformers robot action figure or Happy Meal Minions toy show up from out of the blue to save the day. “As a result, the story skipped around haphazardly and created a sequence of disconnected events that even those paying close attention would be at a loss to decipher.”

“At one point, John Cena, who up until then had no superpowers whatsoever, suddenly gained the ability to fly at the very last minute to stop a rocket from crashing into the team’s base,” Elliot continued. “Unfortunately, it’s inconsistent details in his narrative like this that ruin any chance of enjoyment for anyone trying to follow along.”

All onlookers agreed, however, that the ending of his storyline, in which a giant 7-year-old boy came down from the sky and destroyed the Earth, was an excellent twist."

Every bus driver and train conductor will be wearing those reflective visor sunglasses and dressed in these badass steampunk trench coats. But it’s about more than just looks. There’ll be a lot of laser whirring noises all the time, and, every once in a while, just a low, vibrational rumble. We’re going to have all kinds of hologram advertisements on everything that will know information about you personally. It’ll be like Tokyo times a thousand.” Advising reporters that his job title and the name of his department had changed, Buttigieg added that he should henceforth be referred to as the Grand Admiral of the Department of Teleportation."
Florida Bans Schools From Teaching Anything Besides Misadventures Of Best Friends George Washington And Jesus Christ,https://www.theonion.com/florida-bans-schools-from-teaching-anything-besides-mis-1848825800,TheOnion,"TALLAHASSEE, FL—Claiming that the public education system indoctrinated students with liberal rhetoric, Florida lawmakers passed a new bill Tuesday that banned schools from teaching students anything besides the misadventures of the two best friends George Washington and Jesus Christ. “In classrooms across our state, young people have been brainwashed with progressive ideologies, so I am proud to sign this legislation that requires all lessons at every grade level to be about the wacky hijinx of America’s first president and his lifelong pal, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,” said Gov. Ron DeSantis, detailing how subjects such as biology, history, music, art, algebra, and chemistry must now either be stricken from the curriculum or re-tooled to focus on the story of how the Messiah and the Revolutionary War general first teamed up as young boys to found the United States. “We must eradicate liberal myths so we can teach children the real history of our nation, like how Jesus fed loaves and fishes to all of Washington’s troops at Valley Forge so they could defeat the British army. Understanding this friendship is fundamental to understanding America, but thanks to the left’s propaganda, most students these days can’t even tell you that President Washington and Jesus were born on the same night in the manger on Plymouth Rock. With this law, our kids can finally learn how Washington and Christ rode around on dinosaurs with their talking bald eagle sidekick, Jerome.” At press time, Florida had reportedly shifted course, banning all books about Jesus and Washington after it was discovered the men were of different races and must therefore have violated segregation laws."

I Thought This Was The Kind Of Shit America Liked- Vladimir Putin,https://www.theonion.com/i-thought-this-was-the-kind-of-shit-america-liked-1848699573,TheOnion,"On Feb. 24, 2022, I—Vladimir Putin—sent troops into Ukraine to conduct a special military operation. As the president of Russia, I obviously expected resistance from leaders of certain key world powers, but I must say I’ve been surprised at how the United States, specifically, has reacted.



What gives? I thought this was the shit America liked! I thought invasions, war, and unprovoked aggression against a small, far less militarized nation was kind of like, your thing, you know? What am I missing here?

I mean, seriously, this is your shit to a tee! Choosing a country, making up an excuse to invade that country, and then bombing the living fuck out of that country until it’s yours for the taking? That definitely sounds a lot like someone I know.

Maybe I totally misread this situation, but I expected you guys to be at least a tiny bit excited that I attempted to assassinate a country’s elected leader and replace him with someone loyal to me. That type of plan has America written all over it! You love it. And it’s okay! Don’t pretend you don’t!

Tanks? Yes! Biological weapons? Duh. Thermobaric explosions that suck the oxygen out of the atmosphere and instantly incinerate people alive? You guys eat that shit up for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and we both know it.

Yum, yum, yum. Eat it up! Here comes the train. Choo-choo!

I have to tell you, I did expect some pushback. I expected you to get all high and mighty, call me a monster, and accuse me of war crimes. But I didn’t expect you to be so goddamned bitchy.

Advertisement

Because there’s no way you don’t actually like this. I know you. I am you!

Biden, come on, man! You’ve got to admit it was fun to rally the troops to invade Afghanistan. Or when hundreds of thousands of civilians died in Iraq. That was a total blast, right? Also, can I just say your military wrote the book on how to bomb a hospital and get away with it? Honestly, I don’t even know who you are anymore.

Maybe you’re scared to admit it, but I know how it feels to sit back, press a button, and order one of the biggest militaries in the world to level an entire country. You can play dumb with me all you want, but believe me, we both love it. Embrace it!

I mean, you guys totally destroyed Central America. And Vietnam. Don’t even get me started on what you did to the Middle East. Faking all that WMD shit was fucking awesome. Like, why didn’t I think of that?

Advertisement

Honestly, though, I do think it’s a bit odd and, frankly, immature that you’re acting so upset about this. Why punish me with sanctions just for showing you a good time? Is it because I’m attacking white people? I guess you’re probably jealous because you don’t get to do that. But you could!

Would it help if I used nukes? I’ve got nukes up the wazoo. And you love nukes! The only place that has as many nukes as Russia is, well, you!

Advertisement

Actually, what am I saying? It’s not like you’ve intervened. You haven’t established a no-fly zone, and you’re certainly not going to let Ukraine into NATO. The most you’ve done is send weapons, which only prolongs this. So maybe you do love it?

Yes. Yes, you do! You love every part of this. Which is great, because if you love this, you’re really going to love it when I go after Poland, Slovakia, Czechia, Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Hungary, and Austria!

Yep. You’ll eat that shit up, too. Yes, you fucking will. Because you love it. We all do!"

At that stage, we should be able to promote you to a high ranking position in the Vatican without a problem.” At press time, Pope Francis had reportedly been forced to relocate God again after several beings of incomprehensible aspect accused Him of inappropriate touching.

Then they can watch as it is torn apart, segment by segment, in a final moment of overwhelming, rapturous bliss. In the unlikely event a bug does survive the ultimate orgasm, it will try, in vain, to recreate the feeling by compulsively mating with everything in sight until it literally drops dead from the effort.” Garrett went on to explain that unfortunately using the new product may result in the consumer’s home becoming completely drenched in bug semen."

All I did was drive past at the wrong time. Maybe if I beg, he’ll left me off by just paralyzing me.” At press time, Johnson told reporters that the officer had also clearly planted a gun, a bag of drugs, and incriminating DNA to reach his monthly quota of police framings.

Experts Recommend Raising Minimum Age For Committing Mass Shootings To 21,https://www.theonion.com/experts-recommend-raising-minimum-age-for-committing-ma-1849094237,TheOnion,"WASHINGTON—In a policy recommendation they described as an important first step toward ending the nation’s gun violence epidemic, experts at the Brookings Institution suggested Wednesday that the minimum age for committing a mass shooting be raised to 21. “Though it would not prevent all deadly gun rampages, tightening the age restrictions on carrying out large-scale, indiscriminate murder is a common-sense reform that could save hundreds of lives,” said firearm policy expert Dan Pendleton, arguing that police should apprehend any mass shooter who fails to present an ID proving they are 21 years of age or older. “If someone is going to shoot up a school, shopping mall, or grocery store, we want to ensure they possess the rational decision-making skills of a mature adult with a fully developed brain. Too young, and they don’t have the judgment necessary to assess whether to pull the trigger on a crowd of innocent people.” The experts also recommended potential killers undergo a mandatory eight-class training course before they can obtain the mass shooter’s license most states require to open fire on the general public."

Not only should Coach Kennedy have his job back, but he should also be permitted to express his religious freedom by burning at the stake any parent who refuses to sign their child’s permission slip for the treacherous voyage across the Mediterranean.” In a concurring opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that participation in the indiscriminate slaughter of Muslims and Jews should be required to receive a high school diploma."
Report Confirms Anyone Who Really Likes A Politician Is Insane,https://www.theonion.com/report-confirms-anyone-who-really-likes-a-politician-is-1849666839,TheOnion,"MEDFORD, MA—Calling such behavior a guaranteed indicator of severe underlying derangement, a report published Tuesday by researchers at Tufts University confirmed that any person who really, truly likes a politician is batshit insane. “Our findings established a conclusive link between experiencing genuine fondness for a political figure and being a fucking lunatic,” said the report’s lead author Dr. Rachel Strathmore, who urged anyone who had ever felt inspired by a politician, or worse, owned an article of clothing with a politician’s face on it, to immediately seek professional mental help. “It doesn’t matter if they’re at the local, state, or federal level—our data show that if you sense any kind of interpersonal connection with an elected leader or candidate, even just a little, you’re a delusional maniac and your brain is fundamentally broken. A healthy, rational human mind understands politicians as a means to achieve a political goal and nothing more, but when someone inappropriately perceives real affection for them, that’s pure psychosis. Anyone proudly calling themselves a ‘Mitt Romney stan’ or a ‘Jeanne Shaheenista’ is actually saying, ‘I am pathologically fixated on an unlikable stranger and require extreme psychiatric intervention at once.’ Politicians aren’t your friends, they don’t enrich you culturally or spiritually, and they don’t love you back. Only someone completely detached from reality would think otherwise.” Strathmore also emphasized that while some forms of liking politicians could be treated with extensive therapy, anyone who expresses sexual attraction to a politician should be humanely euthanized on sight."

But you also can’t let yourself completely off the hook, if we’re being honest. After all, Mom and Dad haven’t had a single goddamn moment to themselves in the past six years. Are we saying you should’ve been the one to fix our relationship issues? Not at all. But the fact that you cry nonstop every time we try to leave you with a babysitter sure hasn’t made things any easier. Not to mention all the financial pressure we’ve endured just to pay for your daycare and preschool. So perhaps we all share a little bit of the blame. Does that make sense?” Rebecca Kriescher later added that while it wasn’t her daughter fault’s that “Dad met that whore Meredith at the office,” childbirth is hell, and no couple’s sex life is ever really the same afterward."

I swear, they better not take away her curves!

The shotgun comes fully loaded, so it’s easy to put crumpled, bleeding pedestrians out of their misery for good—whether it’s single adult, a child, or a family of four. In the past, drivers have been forced to keep hitting people with their pickup over and over again to make sure they were dead, but now we’ve found a way to avoid causing any additional damage to the truck.” At press time, J.D.

The moon could descent too quickly and disintegrate on impact with the Martian surface, or it could, upon its return, fail to achieve the velocity needed to escape the gravity of Mars and make it back home to its orbit around the Earth. But should we succeed in our mission, it could open up many other opportunities for us, such as putting the Earth on Mars, putting Mars on Venus, and so on.” Nelson added that it might also one day be possible to build a colony on Mars that could be inhabited by hundreds of moons."

If I get back tonight and there’s a charred pile of rubble laden with human remains that are burnt beyond recognition, well, at least I’ll know once and for all that I forgot to turn the stove off.” At press time, Golinski had reportedly moved on from mourning her dead neighbors to researching a good lawyer she could hire if she were to be found culpable for their deaths."

According to sources, the curt, nearly imperceptible motion set off a wave of low whispers and a scuttling of chairs from the extremities of the conference table, and sent dozens of aides in dark suits scurrying from the room in a panic. The silhouetted figure behind the magnanimous gesture reportedly remained stock-still at the vortex of the chaos as the average price of a gallon of gasoline began to drop in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, and leading economists’ fears of a looming recession were staved off. At press time, the entire boardroom had fallen silent once again, watching rapt as the figure vanished.

Frankly, we didn’t realize it had happened until we heard some radio chatter that he’d been killed.

I’ll just say the first thing to look for is whether a person’s thighs are vertical or horizontal. That will tell you a lot right there.” Rothbaum added that her 10% error rate was mostly the result of misinterpreting the body language of people who were squatting, lying on a bed, or flying headlong down a flight of stairs."

This will help to better integrate police into the community, letting everyone know that law enforcement is doing its best to send their loved ones off to whatever afterlife they believe in. If police keep these rituals in mind while they’re unloading rounds into an unarmed suspect, they could, for example, hold a candlelight vigil while they’re standing around and watching the person bleed out on the pavement.” Palacios went on to describe another course she offers that instructs police on how to go about sexually harassing a fellow officer who is gay."

I’ve instructed our team to check in on him regularly, just to make light small talk and remind him that this is all temporary, so there’s definitely no reason to act rashly and permanently enact any meaningful reform that can’t be undone when he’s feeling better.

Plus, the school security guard told us he saw the shooter exit the building through a door that locked behind him, so to reenter and continue killing children he had to run all the way around the school to the front door , which probably took a lot out of the little guy. If everyone just remains calm, the assailant should be ready to rest his weary bones in no time.” The police chief added that the officers were encouraged by reports from those trapped in the school who said the shooter was headed for the kindergarten, which was a classroom with a lot of pillows that might tempt him to lie down and take a nap.

In addition to the first 1,000 fans to stand for the anthem being sent to war, anyone in the stands seen tearing up or humming along to our beautiful anthem will be sent to Syria or Afghanistan, or will be conscripted into the U.S. Marines or U.S. Navy in critical non-combat administrative roles. We know how much our fans support the mission of the U.S. military, so we thought there is no better way to give back than by joining it. This partnership will continue through the Super Bowl and during every game next season.” At press time, the national anthem was halfway done while everyone in the stands, as well as both teams and coaching staffs, remained nervously seated, except for Titans quarterback Ryan Tannehill, who appeared confused as a military recruiter ushered him off the field and into a helicopter waiting to take him to basic training.

Study Finds Falling To Knees And Screaming To Sky Remains Best Way Of Forsaking One’s God,https://www.theonion.com/study-finds-falling-to-knees-and-screaming-to-sky-remai-1849435117,TheOnion,"OXFORD, ENGLAND—Researchers from the University of Oxford published the results of a new study Tuesday that found falling to your knees and screaming toward the sky remained the best way of forsaking one’s god. “According to our study, we found that subjects who shouted ‘Damn you!’ with their faces directed upward were able to best express that God had abandoned them and, in turn, that they would abandon God,” said Henry Bancroft, co-author of the study in the current issue of The Journal Of Theological Studies, adding that the method was narrowly trailed by rending one’s garment in the pouring rain. “The results are especially effective when combined with shaking one’s fist and howling in agony. Watching the sand slip through one’s fingers as a metaphor of all that has been lost may also boost efficacy. This of course changes much of what we previously assumed about clutching the corpse of one’s only son.” At press time, Bancroft confirmed that getting blasted by a single bolt of lightning was still the best way of being smote by one’s god.

This will be followed by invasive golf carts moving in and making it possible for the first members-only clubhouses to gain a foothold on the continent.” The report went on to note that unlike most consequences of climate change, this outcome was likely to have a disproportionately large impact on white people."

Bennie Thompson (D-MS), who recounted his own panic-fueled sex with a congresswoman he declined to name in the office where they were both hiding, and then showed a video of Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) sprinting through the Capitol in an effort to find one last sexual partner before the rioters killed them all. “Testimony from those present during the attack, corroborated in some cases by photographic and video evidence, reveals that dozens of desperate lawmakers decided to consummate long-held infatuations with members of the opposite party, while others simply went at it with whichever congressperson was closest at hand. Some of the more conclusive evidence of this collective move into dread-fueled sexual promiscuity includes Sen.

Tom O’Halleran (D-AZ) leading a group of representatives on a hunt for condoms; and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) shaking Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) to get a hold of himself before leading him into her office. The scale of the fear is evident in the fact that few of them took party, age, or even gender into account, so desperate were these members of Congress to experience one last moment of erotic bliss before the slaughter.” The committee then showed a previously unaired video of screaming throughout the halls of Congress slowly turning into lustful moans and sustained cries of pleasure.

Encouraging Report Finds Most Of Planet Will Still Be Habitable In 2023,https://www.theonion.com/encouraging-report-finds-most-of-planet-will-still-be-h-1849022268,TheOnion,"NEW YORK—Reversing long-held theories about the potentially devastating effects of climate change, scientists published an encouraging report Monday that found most of the planet would still be habitable in 2023. “While many are understandably nervous about the future of our rapidly changing world, our data optimistically suggests that Earth will largely be able to continue to sustain human life through much of next year,” said lead researcher Dr. Jessie Lansing, adding that promising models showed that rising sea levels, destructive weather events, and increased temperatures would largely not cause widespread extinction among Earth’s population within the next 365 days. “The findings are still preliminary, but we are confident in saying that by 2023, at least 50% of Earth will not yet be destroyed by mass extinctions, famine, fires, diseases, or floods. Contrary to many doomsday scenarios, humanity will continue to exist on Earth until at least 2024—and maybe even longer, if we’re lucky.” At press time, Lansing added that the encouraging findings also indicated that human life could continue on as normal for as long as the next 24 to 48 hours."
Ghislaine Maxwell Receives Lighter Sentence For Years Of Dedicated Work With Children,https://www.theonion.com/ghislaine-maxwell-receives-lighter-sentence-for-years-o-1849119973,TheOnion,"NEW YORK—Sentenced to 20 years in prison, Ghislaine Maxwell reportedly received a lighter penalty Tuesday for her years of dedicated work with children. “Ms. Maxwell had very deep, personal ties with local children and shepherded them through a confusing system with a commitment few other mentors would,” said Judge Alison J. Nathan, who handed the former Jeffrey Epstein associate a sentence a decade shorter than what the federal prosecutors had recommended in order to encourage others to get similarly involved with children in their own communities. “The lengths she went to for these vulnerable kids is truly inspiring. Without Ms. Maxwell, these children would have never had the chance to see the world or build valuable networking connections with some of the world’s most powerful figures. She even helped some of these children meet their husbands.” At press time, the Federal Bureau of Prisons assigned Maxwell to a juvenile detention center where she could continue her important work.

Neurosurgeon Feels Lucky He Was Able To Turn Hobby Into Career,https://www.theonion.com/neurosurgeon-feels-lucky-he-was-able-to-turn-hobby-into-1841933012,TheOnion,"ROCHESTER, MN—Speaking with reporters about how lucky he feels to be pursuing his life’s passion full-time, local neurosurgeon Chris Monson said Wednesday he will always be grateful he found a way to turn his favorite hobby into a career.

A self-taught cerebrovascular surgeon who learned the craft in his spare time, Monson recalled how he started out by tinkering around on nights and weekends in his garage, where he would cut into human brains under the dim light of a single bare bulb and, whenever possible, convince reluctant family members to serve as guinea pigs.

“I just feel so blessed that what was once a simple pastime of cracking open a skull here and digging out a tumor there has blossomed into a profession,” said Monson, adding that the first 50 or 60 brains he worked on didn’t turn out too well, but through extensive trial and error, he eventually began to see “the lay of the land” and learn his way around the central nervous system. “It’s wild to think I’m making six figures for something I used to do for fun. In those early days, it honestly never occurred to me you could make a living at this.”

“Back then, I didn’t even care if the hammer slipped and I got a face full of cerebrospinal fluid,” Monson continued. “It was all a labor of love.”

“I just feel so ble ssed that what was once a simple pastime of cracking open a skull here and digging out a tumor there has blossomed into a profession.”

As he sat in his office at the world-renowned Mayo Clinic, Monson reminisced about the long, difficult road to becoming the successful surgeon he is today. In the beginning, he didn’t even have access to proper tools, and his hands would reportedly shake every time he used a box cutter to make an incision or clipped off a bulging aneurysm with a rusty pair of wire cutters. With MRI and PET scan technology far beyond his reach, he had to “rope in a buddy and fire up the drill press every time [he] wanted to see what was going on under the hood.”

Nowadays, Monson has access to all the state-of-the-art equipment he needs, but he admits he occasionally gets nostalgic for the days when he was his own boss and didn’t have to concern himself with paperwork, professional licensing requirements, or remembering to wear a mask and gloves.

“My first operating table was just a piece of plywood on a couple sawhorses next to my lawnmower,” said Monson while scrubbing in for a routine minimally invasive neuroendoscopy. “There wasn’t anyone around telling you which parts of the cerebrum you could or couldn’t remove. If you wanted to know what happens when you hook a car battery up to a brain stem or stick a pencil through the corpus callosum, you just went right ahead and tried it.”

“There are times when I miss the bone dust on my work boots and the whirring of an old Craftsman band saw in my ears,” he added. “This place can feel a little sterile by comparison.”

Monson remarked that just as hard as learning the ins and outs of the most complex organ in the body was learning to tune out the doubters and naysayers who did not approve of his devotion to amateur surgery. Friends and family reportedly told him he should abandon his obsession with do-it-yourself craniotomies and get a real job. According to Monson, his wife at the time was never supportive, complaining every time he operated into the early hours of the morning and came to bed covered in brain matter and skull fragments.

“When I first started, I didn’t know the difference between this lobe or that hemisphere—I just saw this big pink lump of meat and thought there must be something interesting going on in there,” Monson said. “It goes to show anyone can teach themselves how to do this stuff. Of course, when you have a day job, you may get to work on something and then have to put it aside until the weekend, and when you finally come back to it, you’re staring at a pile of dead nervous tissues. But keep at it! You’ll get there.”

“Just remember to seize every opportunity you get to grab a knife and poke around in a human brain,” he added. “But above all, don’t be afraid to fail—a lot.”"

Justice Alito Somberly Ties Noose After Realizing He Not Mentioned In Constitution,https://www.theonion.com/justice-alito-somberly-ties-noose-after-realizing-he-no-1848875143,TheOnion,"WASHINGTON—Building upon the arguments in his draft of the majority opinion likely to overturn Roe v. Wade, Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito was said to have somberly tied a noose Tuesday after realizing he himself was not mentioned in the U.S. Constitution. “Absolutely nowhere in this nation’s foundational governing charter did the Founding Fathers set forth the right for me to draw breath,” said the associate justice, who reportedly tied a hangman’s knot into a rope and stepped on top of his desk after penning a 900-page suicide note in which he argued that if Samuel Alito was not enumerated in the Constitution, then Samuel Alito should not exist. “Just because my life has a precedent of 72 years does not mean that my existence is so sacred that it cannot be overruled. There is actually a lengthy history in the United States of my nonexistence, stretching from my birth back to 1776. In fact, none of the other Supreme Court justices are mentioned, either, so maybe I should take care of them first.” At press time, sources confirmed Alito had spiraled into a mental breakdown after realizing his suicide was also not set forth in the Constitution."

And then, we discovered that they evolved as early as Spring instead of Summer 4 billion years ago. But this extra 20 minutes changes everything. That’s the difference between the appetizer and the dinner course four billion years ago.” At press time, scientists were reeling when they discovered evidence that the heat death of the universe would occur 30 seconds earlier than expected."

You can get several ounces of good meat out of each breast,” said area 34-year-old Randall Probst, explaining that the supply chain issues shouldn’t be a big deal, as women’s breasts begin to produce significant quantities of meat during the second trimester of pregnancy. “Nature has already provided a solution to this so-called ‘problem,’ and it’s pretty obvious. In fact, it’s what these moms should have been doing in the first place, because breast meat has way more nutrients than store-bought formula. Just put your breast in the kid’s mouth, and get them to take a big bite out of it. Mothers have been feeding their babies this way since the beginning of time.” Probst added that while women may feel a little pinch when an infant is tearing off and chewing pieces of their breast, he’s heard that after a while it becomes a pleasurable bonding experience."

We got really close on our California trip last year, but then Danny had to break into a sprint after a man opened fire. Oh great, not again—Mason, stop bleeding!” At press time, Church had reportedly resigned herself to the fact that the family would have to wait until their first international trip.

And no, it’s not an excuse that the nurse was bleeding out in her office. It’s especially insulting that these students texted and called their families to say they loved them, despite rules specifically forbidding phone use in classrooms.” At press time, Principal Russell explained that the terrified students had earned themselves an additional detention for sprinting in the halls to avoid gunfire."

Dr. Alan Nolan, a biophysicist at Drexel University who has led research efforts into the puzzling phenomenon, told reporters that systematic observation and data analysis have failed to adequately explain how the subject could possibly fit into size 32 jeans mere moments after comfortably wearing a pair of size 33 khakis. According to Nolan, a broad array of hypotheses, ranging from Holland wearing a belt with the size 33s to Holland ingesting a large quantity of food or drink between putting on the size 32 and 33 pants, have all been ruled out, leaving the research team at a complete loss.

“For 16 months, we’ve painstakingly conducted a battery of tests using every conceivable variety of pants, and we still haven’t determined how the same man could fit into slacks with a waist of 32 as well as trousers in 33,” said Nolan, confirming that the two differently sized pants were neither too tight nor too loose on Holland, with both sitting comfortably about his waist without any need to be adjusted or periodically pulled up. “Our test subject is truly a scientific marvel. We’ve held double-blind clinical trials and somehow produced the same results time and time again. The 33-inch chinos from the Gap were even a little snug compared to 32-inch pleated Dockers.”

“It defies physical law,” added Nolan. “This is completely shifting our fundamental understanding of pants.”

Nolan confirmed that the team of scientists tested various jeans, khakis, and corduroys against a pair of control pants, a size 28 from Kohl’s, which consistently did not fit the subject in any trial. According to the researcher, the control pants created a baseline for the experiments and proved the validity of tests in which pants with a 32-inch waist and 33-inch waist were administered to Holland and carefully examined for comfiness, tightness around the hips and thigh, and the subject’s ability to zip and button the fly without having to suck in.

Throughout their rigorous pants testing, the researchers said they closely monitored Holland’s weight, pelvic density, body mass index, and fluid retention, but detected no inconstancy in the subject’s physiology that might skew the reliability of the results.

During a separate six-month-long investigation, the scientists confirmed that they carefully scrutinized the labels on the pants thousands of times and contacted manufacturers to verify that the numbers on the pants indeed indicated the pants’ size.

“Despite widespread speculation among members of the scientific community that the pants may have been mislabeled, researchers have eliminated that possibility with a 99.9 percent certainty,” said a visibly shaken Nolan. “We did remove a pair of cargo pants from the trials, however, because the drawstrings produced misleading data.”

“Perhaps even more baffling is that the subject maintained a constant 30-inch inseam,” continued Nolan. “Unfortunately, modern science offers no answers on this particular phenomenon.”

In another shocking discovery that rocked the scientific community, researchers found that the same subject appeared to inexplicably slim down while wearing shirts with vertical stripes."

Study Finds Only 2% Of Americans Can Draw Cool Flames,https://www.theonion.com/study-finds-only-2-of-americans-can-draw-cool-flames-1848596677,TheOnion,"PITTSBURGH—Fears that the U.S. education system was growing increasingly lame were confirmed Thursday when an alarming study by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University found that only 2% of the nation’s population can draw cool flames. “Among our frankly disturbing findings was that 98 in 100 Americans have absolutely no capacity to sketch flames that could remotely be described as badass, much less totally bitchin’,” said study co-author Keela Douglas, adding that the data further revealed that less than half of Americans who can draw cool flames are able to actually incorporate those flames into something that looks fucking sick, like a skull, sports car, or bald eagle. “While we concluded that around 15% of Americans can draw flames, the vast majority of those are flames that look realistic but aren’t cool as hell at all. In at least 30% of ostensible flame drawings, our study found that they look more like shitty-ass Christmas trees. It’s a sad state of affairs for America, a country where as recently as 1970 over 80% of U.S. residents could draw flames with some degree of coolness.” The study comes on the heels of related research at the University of Texas at Austin that found that over 85% of Americans can only carve lame shit into their desks like emo lyrics or a heart.

We just hope it’s not super awkward,” said Nelson, who noted that NASA astronauts were currently undergoing rigorous training to simulate what it would be like when they landed and the moon gave them a completely blank look. “I’m not saying we’re expecting the worst-case scenario, but, I mean, we haven’t exactly been keeping in touch.

Right away, I’ll put their dismembered bodies into a freezer somewhere. And I’ll only take them out when I know it’s a prudent decision. And when friends and hangers-on come to me begging for one little hint about whether I was involved in my coworkers’ unforeseen disappearances, I know that I just have to firmly tell them ‘no.’ It’ll be a big adjustment learning to live with the knowledge that I have the the blood of seven people on my hands, but I’m sure it will ultimately transform my life for the better.” At press time, Ortega admitted that if she did lose she might still treat herself to slaying one coworker.

"Is It Just Me, Or Do The Sex Dreams About Santa Start Earlier And Earlier Each Year?",https://www.theonion.com/is-it-just-me-or-do-the-sex-dreams-about-santa-start-e-1849692871,TheOnion,"Hello. Well, it’s here already: another holiday season. Don’t get me wrong, I love Christmas more than anyone, but you have to admit, it feels just a little less special when we’re thinking about the Yuletide spirit and there’s not even snow on the ground yet. I mean, seriously, is it just me, or do the intense, sweaty sex dreams about fucking and being fucked by Santa Claus start earlier and earlier every year?



I know, I know, everyone always says that! But seriously, isn’t it kind of odd how last night—a full eight weeks before Christmas, mind you—I had a dream in which Jolly Old St. Nick crept down my chimney and surprised me in bed, fondling my throbbing cock through my pajama bottoms while lightly kissing the base of my neck?

Advertisement

Come on, people, it’s not even November yet!

And look, Christmas is my favorite time of year. When it comes to caroling, whipping up a batch of my famous fruitcake, or wandering through the corridors of a dream-gingerbread house in which at every turn I find a naked Santa leering at me while eagerly lapping away at Mrs. Claus’ soaking wet hole, I’m practically Tiny Tim!

Advertisement

But there’s a time and place for everything, and when I find myself waking up with my comforter caked in drying semen after yet another marathon double-orgasm wet dream in which Santa fits me with a reindeer harness while he and his cackling workshop elves take turns filling my mouth and beckoning asshole with a series of thicker and wider candy canes, I want there to at least be a nip in the air! I’m sorry, maybe I’m just old-fashioned like that.

Because despite what the Grinches and the Ebenezer Scrooges out there may try to tell you, Christmas is a wonderful time. It’s a time for gratitude, for charity, for taking a powerful dose of melatonin to make sure you don’t awaken before the conclusion of a frighteningly vivid reverie in which Kris Kringle is holding a gun to your head and forcing you to beat off in front of your parents, and for togetherness.

But if these things don’t arrive at the right time, it makes all those dreams about crawling on my hands and knees through my local mall’s Santa’s Village display while being hunted down by a lust-maddened Heat Miser a little less special—and don’t let the greeting card companies tell you any different.

Where does it end? I’m already having feverish, fluid-rich fuck dreams about Santa, with an occasional cameo by a Sybian-riding George Bailey, and Christmas is still two months away! Am I going crazy here?

Advertisement

I mean, if I’m already grinning from ear to ear while tangling my sheets into a clammy mess as I envision Father Christmas taking me from behind while shoving my face into a freshly baked mince pie, then what does that do to the rest of the holiday calendar? You can be sure I haven’t even had time to dream about a group of pilgrims and Wampanoag chieftains trussing me up, basting me in gravy, and visiting an array of hallucinatory degradations on me in between trips to the buffet table.

Seriously, when exactly was I supposed to take the time to fantasize about that—July?

Advertisement

At this rate, come next year, the only way I’ll be able to fulfill all of my carnal, seasonal-based needs will be to combine them into one extended dream odyssey in which a leprechaun, Cupid, and Abraham Lincoln take turns sucking me off as we all wait patiently for the Easter Bunny to yield a warm egg from its quivering aperture and then step on it. Sure, that would be really hot, and I’d probably come extremely hard, but that’s not the point.

The point is that Christmas is magical. It’s about more than just presents, or a perfectly cooked goose with all the trimmings, or a recurring dream of Santa wearing a black SS officer’s cap and punishing my balls with a riding crop. It’s about the twinkle in a child’s eye, my moans of pleasure when I dream of Santa spitting on me, and blowing my load so loudly it wakes up my downstairs neighbors and frightens their kids. And it’s something that I’m sorry to say the retailers and the advertisers and the holiday jingle tunesmiths will never understand.

So be patient, I say! Enjoy the holiday season for what it is, and when it is. Sure, you may want to choke yourself out right now so that you can fall into a phantasmagoric scenario where you and Santa work together to melt a pleading Frosty the Snowman with your hot piss, but hold off! Delay your gratification, and edge yourself until you’re just about ready to burst with the holiday spirit.

And if you do that, well, I can promise it won’t be long at all until you’ll hear me say, “Merry Christmas to all, and to all a very, very, good night!”"

You can’t stop progress, and you can’t really separate deadly bears that shoot acid from their mouths from the technology that helps people every day. Besides, these grizzlies have many nonlethal uses. Do you want to deny an elderly woman a powerful machine-bear hybrid that can carry her groceries and dispense her medication just because it also has the potential to kill millions of human beings?” At press time, Congress had approved $8 billion in research grants for the Grizzly Project after hearing China was well on its way to developing fire-breathing pandas."

When Elizabeth passed on Sept. 8, English citizens reportedly paused their dismal everyday lives and entered a gloomy grieving period from which they were only now starting to emerge, becoming dour and wretched once again. According to reports, the melancholic mood brought on by the monarch’s death had begun to lift, and a new period of ordinary melancholy had descended on the country’s 56 million people as they went about their colorless existence with the same sadness they’d always known and felt deep in their bones. Having shed their funereal black clothing and donned once more their traditional dreary wardrobes, residents told reporters they were finally moving past the grim, cheerless conversations about what the queen had meant to England and were back to discussing their customary topics of dispiriting tedium. While they acknowledged no one could replace Elizabeth II, the English vowed to move beyond the sorrows of losing the regent who had defined the past seven decades of their existence and return to the generally demoralizing experience of living in a country racked by constant cold and rain. For their part, members of the British media announced they would be concluding their deeply stupid coverage of the queen’s passing and returning to their regularly scheduled deeply stupid programming.

Biblical Historians Reveal Jesus Christ Chose Stage Name To Sound Less Jewish,https://www.theonion.com/biblical-historians-reveal-jesus-christ-chose-stage-nam-1849683024,TheOnion,"OXFORD, ENGLAND—Unearthing text excluded from the canonical Bible during the First Council of Nicaea, biblical historians at the University of Oxford revealed Thursday that the man recognized by Christians as the Son of God chose Jesus Christ as a stage name in order to come off as less Jewish. “According to these newly discovered writings, Jesus was advised that He would never make it as a religious figure or be worshipped by billions with a last name like Moskowitz,” textual scholar Dean Wilson said of the reconstructed Gospel passage, in which Jesus appears to adopt the surname Christ so He can appeal to a broader audience in the antisemitic Roman Empire. “As Jesus Moskowitz, He had done pretty well drawing local crowds in Galilee, but He concluded that if He ever wanted to be anything more than a small-time cult leader with some revolutionary ideas, He’d need a less ethnic-sounding name. And of course, it was as Jesus Christ that He achieved worldwide success. He was so pleased with the change that He later advised Saul of Taurus to drop his Hebrew name for the Latinized Paul in order to attract more Romans to Christianity.” The new finding by biblical scholars follows a startling discovery last year in which art historians concluded that frequent depictions of Jesus with European features merely reflect the fact that Christ’s vanity and His hunger for fame and glory led Him to get nose job."

We understand you may be tempted, but sex is something you won’t be prepared for until you’re much older, like 14 or 15. If you have any questions, you can always turn to the Bible.” At press time, Bell added that the child’s first time would be something she would remember forever."

How was she supposed to have the energy to look after a bunch of hatchlings when she was busy all day using 12,000 pounds of bite force to crush the bones of her prey?” According to the paleontologists, the arrangement of fossils found at the site suggest the tyrannosaur was probably on her way to have her eggs thawed and fertilized for incubation when, along with most animal life on the planet, she was wiped out by a massive asteroid."

Just because they seem cool now doesn’t mean she’ll still like them in a few years. You can tell she used to be very beautiful, too, but not with all of those. Yuck. I guess she must have been super drunk. How can she even get a job with all those?” At press time, Wagner added that while there were ways to get rid of them, he knew from experience how expensive that could be.

Scientists Speculate Universe May Be Simulation After ‘Trial Version Expired’ Appears Across Sky,https://www.theonion.com/scientists-speculate-universe-may-be-simulation-after-1848673336,TheOnion,"COLLEGE PARK, MD—In what is being hailed as the first empirical evidence in support of a hypothesis that has gained popularity in recent years, top scientists speculated Friday that the universe may indeed be a simulation controlled by an unseen entity after the words “trial version expired” appeared in the sky. “When we can look overhead and see what appears to be an error message from a computer operating system, it certainly lends new credence to the argument that we’re living in an artificial reality,” said University of Maryland physicist Harold M. Cramer, adding that from what he and his colleagues could glean from the airborne phenomenon, human consciousness would be terminated in five days if no further action was taken. “Though it’s possible we are witnessing an optical illusion caused by some kind of atmospheric distortion, the request for a verification code that keeps popping up suggests that our reality may indeed have a specific, singular subscriber, and that this entity must upgrade to a premium subscription in order to avoid any interruption to our experience of consciousness. We can only hope this cosmic account holder can guide us though the two-factor authentication process so that our simulacrum of life remains operational.” At press time, a team of leading cosmologists announced it had successfully renewed the free trial period for another 14 billion years by simply signing up again with a different email address."

It’s not fair that I had to play him in week one and lose, and then my leaguemates get to coast to easy wins just because this asshole is apparently too busy grieving. He has good players just sitting on the bench, too, and if he’s not going to play them, he should release them to the free agent pool so us teams on the bottom can have a better chance. He’s being so selfish.” At press time, leaguemate Aaron Winchell was repeatedly texting Beckley to stop fucking crying and respond to his trade offer.

But that still doesn’t explain why we thought they were the same guy. Johnny Depp’s, like, 15 years older and much less cute.

We also encourage customers to upgrade to first class or business class should they want to fly into the side of a mountain a fraction of a second sooner.

How are residents supposed to break into their state’s capitol and kidnap their governor if they have to drive 40 minutes just to buy flags, balaclavas, torches, and rope? Plus, if they did, zero pedestrians would even be there to see it.” Dr. Jackson added that until red states could improve walkability, residents would have no choice but to keep traveling to blue states to ram their trucks into large crowds of people.

So, if you look at the 72% of the 10,392, then there’s at least a two-thirds 40 of six, and that’s only from the years 800 to 2090 alone. Which is quite interesting, as we usually see the 50s break into the 20s, or even nines. I’ve run 10 trillion simulations on 30 alone, and there’s less than a 99% chance that there’s more than a 99% chance of 99, so you see? You see? Except under a Republican Congress, in which case it’s the opposite. There’s 15,000 total election combinations, plus 2.3333333333333, and with that kind of data set there’s a plus-minus 20,000 of error, which is at least half as much as the 8.2 quadrillion we saw in the 829th version of the 1996 election, which is going to have a huge effect on six and a half.

However, keep in mind, your Google experience will always be improved if Sundar can sleep at least 8 hours under your bed. We highly recommend allowing it.” At press time, Google was under fire after failing to remove the default setting that allowed Pichai to accidentally walk in on users while they were using the bathroom."

Close the gates! Prepare yourselves with PPE and the spirit of a warrior. This variant is stronger, this variant is faster—and it wants vengeance!” At press time, witnesses confirmed Zehnder had dropped the horn in shock after an entire army of coronavirus mutations had appeared on the horizon behind the variant.

I’m completely blown away by what I’ve seen today. Who would have thought that naked bodies were once the beauty standard?” At press time, Harster’s old insecurities had come surging back after she passed a sculpture that did not have a head.

Lauren Boebert (R-CO), who slammed the all-ages shows as “immoral” and “perverse,” stating that she was deeply disturbed that any parent would take a child under 18 to a place where adults stood on stages and wore sequined, eye-catching clothing. “It’s completely inappropriate to take a young child to a show where people are reveling in the limelight. These poor children will only be confused, asking themselves, ‘Wait, if I lip-sync, can I get people to look at me too?’ It’s bad enough that Britney Spears’ choreography is freely available on YouTube for kids to memorize.” At press time, Boebert was calling for a ban on dancing in the presence of minors.

While anxiety could be reduced in the short-term by successfully concealing all of the shards beneath the rug one’s uncle Adélard brought back from the Orient, it recurred with even greater intensity once the evidence was discovered and a harsh scolding was issued.” Delancy went on to say that the only effective treatment for such anxiety was for the subject to be taken into mother’s arms and reminded that possessions could never compare to the love she had for her darling child."
Politician Supports Right Of Protesters To Assemble Anywhere SUV Can Plow Through Them,https://www.theonion.com/politician-supports-right-of-protesters-to-assemble-any-1848923027,TheOnion,"WASHINGTON—In response to the continuing debate over the ethics of public demonstration, Rep.

The founders are very clear on the right to assemble anywhere a 5,000-pound vehicle can take out a dozen in a single maniac burst, and the First Amendment protects your right to make your voice heard while shouting from the wheel well of an Escalade. Whether it’s a march, a gathering outside an official’s home, or a candlelight vigil, if you can drive an SUV into the crowd and run over a hundred people within seconds, I support it.” Goodrich added that he is also a staunch supporter of letting protesters demonstrate within the crosshairs of a law enforcement sniper’s gun.

Thankfully, we were able to freeze his assets in time, which also included a lavish expansion he had started building into the neighboring borough of the Bronx.” At press time, Jeff Bezos had purchased the seized borough at auction for $1.74 trillion.

Cool Dad Raising Daughter On Media That Will Put Her Entirely Out Of Touch With Her Generation,https://www.theonion.com/cool-dad-raising-daughter-on-media-that-will-put-her-en-1819572981?utm_content=1654385401&amp;fbclid=IwAR3X0j4NmGAkvtPUC59mulxoAq_K5vPmPlHFUYKbwAH4alVTYfMNMPvBtMk&amp;utm_campaign=The+Onion&amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;utm_source=facebook,TheOnion,"RENTON, WA—Local man Paul Campbell confirmed Saturday he was raising his daughter Emma on a variety of media carefully selected to help her cultivate an appreciation for artistic quality, a move that will reportedly put the 12-year-old girl hopelessly out of touch with her generation.

Perusing his music and film collections and showing reporters distinctive, well-regarded works that will thoroughly alienate Emma from her sixth-grade classmates, Campbell said he wanted to make sure his daughter enjoyed the benefits of a cultural education he never received at her age.

""Back then, I listened to junk like Journey and watched crappy movies like Iron Eagle,"" the 41-year-old said in reference to popular music and films of the 1980s that allowed him to have something to talk about with friends. ""I wish my own dad had turned me on to the good stuff, so I wouldn't have had to wait until I was in my 20s before I started digging anything halfway decent.""

""Well, I'm not making the same mistake he did,"" Campbell continued as he pulled out vinyl copies of Television's Marquee Moon, Miles Davis' Sketches Of Spain, and Big Star's #1 Record, highly influential albums that will in no way help his daughter interact with her peers at a particularly delicate time in her social development. ""There's a lot of cool stuff out there, and it's never too early to start learning what's worth your time. I'm just glad I have the know-how to guide her.""

Campbell said he has also been vigilant in ensuring Emma develops an increased familiarity with timeless classic films, a parenting strategy that will inevitably hobble her as she attempts to achieve individuation while negotiating an adolescence heavily influenced by the very latest pop culture.

Since her early childhood, a period sources said featured a Danger Mouse–themed birthday party that utterly baffled the assembled 6-year-old guests, Campbell's daughter has been fed a steady diet of marginalizing cinematic masterpieces from the world's very best filmmakers.

""Jean-Luc Godard, Stanley Kubrick, Billy Wilder—you simply need to know who these men are if you want to call yourself culturally literate,"" Campbell said of the three iconic directors whose creations could not have less utility to his daughter as she searches for a way to achieve a sense of belonging among her fellow middle-schoolers. ""Sure, she makes a face when I don't let her see some ridiculous movie with CGI robots because it's John Sayles Night and we're watching The Secret Of Roan Inish instead. But I'm giving her a leg up, even if she doesn't know it.""

""I'm not unreasonable about this,"" Campbell added. ""If she doesn't want to watch Harold Lloyd shorts tonight, that's no problem. We still have another five or six Prisoner episodes to get through.""

Insisting he understood the important role entertainment media plays in the life of a sixth-grader, Campbell reportedly bought his daughter the Alice Cooper album Billion Dollar Babies on the grounds that the Adam Lambert CD she had begged for—and that all the girls at school had received—was not even a fraction as good as the 1973 masterpiece.

""I absolutely realize where she's at in life,"" Campbell said regarding the 12-year-old girl who has seen The Wild Bunch. ""I don't care if she likes boy bands, but there are plenty out there that have some artistic merit: the Monkees, the Beach Boys, the Jackson 5. Come on, each of those guys is cuter than the next, and they're slightly talented, at least. I'd even be okay with Peter Frampton if she were really adamant about it, especially his early stuff with Humble Pie.""

Reached for comment, Emma Campbell said that while she appreciated her father's dedication, she often had difficulty fitting in with her peers.

""I definitely feel out of place sometimes,"" said Emma, who told reporters she will never forget the blank stares she once received upon mentioning Petula Clark. ""It'd be nice to know what everyone's talking about for a change."""

If you simply take a moment to look inward and clear your mind, you will discover the divine permeates our entire cosmos: the earth, the stars, the darkness, the light, and also the absolute horseshit I’ve been serving up for decades to anyone who’s credulous enough to swallow it.” At press time, reports confirmed Chopra had secured another multimillion-dollar advance after spending an hour or two on a book proposal titled How To Live Forever And Never Feel Sadness Or Pain Of Any Kind."

I spent decades training for this, but suddenly the moon’s son just waltzes in and gets to go to space?

The truth of the matter is, Americans are getting hired every day, with higher salaries to boot. But not Chris. No, no, not Chris. He apparently has nothing to offer at all. God, what a fucking failure.” Walsh went on to state that should job growth continue and the nation stave off a recession, nothing would be a stronger indicator that Gibson deserves to be crushed by a lifetime of grinding poverty, eventually dying for lack of access to healthcare."

The answer is out there, and I’m going to find it. A lot of my colleagues have doubted the value of this research, but when someone who has ingested gallons and gallons of his own urine outlives them all by a decade or two, we’ll see where their skepticism gets them.” Remarking that he didn’t mind being passed over for grants because his studies cost very little to conduct, Tremblay acknowledged he was upset when his paper “A Golden Fountain Of Youth: The Antiaging Effects Of Chugging Piss” was rejected by The New England Journal Of Medicine."

Man Thrown Out Of Club For Touching Stripper’s Heart,https://www.theonion.com/man-thrown-out-of-club-for-touching-stripper-s-heart-1849180780,TheOnion,"PENSACOLA, FL—After multiple violations resulted in the man being forcibly escorted from the establishment Thursday, sources reported that area man Stewart Quillings, 32, was thrown out of a strip club for allegedly touching a stripper’s heart. “He was told several times not to get close to the dancers, but he just kept doing it, asking them about their families and encouraging them to follow their dreams,” Escapes Gentlemen’s Club bouncer Reg Morris said of the deeply empathetic man who “got a little too friendly” with the performers as he listened without judgment to stories of their upbringings and the life circumstances that brought them to find employment as exotic dancers. “We protect our girls here. You don’t get to just waltz in and make them feel emotionally vulnerable. They’re professionals who are here to do a job, and the last thing they need is some guy from off the street giving them a bunch of warmth and compassion.” At press time, Quillings had reportedly reentered the club after learning a code word that would allow him access to a private room in the back where, for $500, he could spend an hour touching a stripper’s heart as much as he liked."

Draw them with sultry pouts and long legs, or perhaps huge biceps and hairy chests, your choice. It’s all fair game. Inside every package is a mind-blowing orgy of Raisinets fucking and sucking each other, if that’s what you want to hear.” At press time, Schneider had begun unbuckling his pants to give a demonstration.

I’ve made several complaints to the HOA about the messy old- growth trees next door, but I haven’t heard a peep, so I finally just had to ask him directly. I don’t mean to be a nag, but the thing is the rainforest doesn’t just block the view—it also attracts a ton of disgusting nuisances like bugs, wild animals, and indigenous people. So hopefully, now that we’ve spoken, they can get it all cleared out by the end of the week.” At press time, a fed-up Zuckerberg was sneaking onto the property in the middle of the night to demolish the neighbor’s loud, obnoxious waterfall that was keeping him awake."

It’s also possible there are several tons of narcotics concealed within this man’s rib cage, and if everyone would please stand back, I would like to pry that apart too.” At press time, O’Shea was seen planting a joint in between the folds of the suspect’s brain."

Right? Remember the crime bill in ’94? Dianne here started off as a Goldwater Republican, then steadily matured into an evangelical theocrat, and actually was among the first senators to endorse Donald Trump for president—or at least that’s what she told me earlier, didn’t you? That’s right, you did. I remember, because it was right after you told me how you voted Democrat once or twice in the ’60s but quickly corrected course in time to wholeheartedly support the Nixon administration. Anyway, looks like I’m in charge again.” At press time, McConnell was seen guiding a pen in Feinstein’s hand to sign a bill completely obliterating the right for women to vote.

Environmental Protection Agency, the Supreme Court casually declared Thursday that the nation had been divided into six provinces, each of which would be ruled by a Republican-appointed justice. “The court hereby decrees that the six justices joining in this opinion will occupy six thrones from which they will reign over the lands once known as the United States,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority, adding that while each province would constitute an independent, absolute monarchy, the realms would nonetheless form a loose confederation and military alliance capable of crushing any rebellion daring to challenge the six new sovereigns. “Nowhere in the Constitution do we find language that specifically forbids the establishment of Gorsuchonia, which now stretches from North Dakota to Ohio, or Alitostan, which encompasses much of the Eastern Seaboard. Nor did our Founders put any mechanisms in place that explicitly state the Supreme Court justices cannot exercise complete control over the lives of their subjects.” At press time, His Imperial Majesty Brett of the House Kavanaugh had named himself emperor following a 1-5 decision to usurp all six thrones."

What better way is there to be perceived as a responsible, health-conscious person?” At press time, reports confirmed the neighbors of people who ordered McDonald’s through HelloFresh could smell the just-delivered Quarter Pounder with Cheese from clear across the street."

In addition, approximately half of Democratic voters expressed interest in seeing a younger woman or a person of color piloting Biden’s limbs and using his voice to speak their own words during the 2024 campaign.” According to the poll, most Democrats, when pressed, acknowledged that if the party failed to “put someone younger in there,” they would support the hollow, empty husk of Joe Biden running for president."

I suppose that’s the tradeoff for more space and privacy, but it can be isolating sometimes to so rarely hear another human receiving pleasure. God forbid there’s ever an emergency, because they’d probably be finished screwing by the time I reached them.” At press time, McCalahan was seen loading up his truck with a pie he had made for his neighbors and with a ladder in case they decided to have sex on the second floor again.

I guess I just get this sick, twisted thrill from not watching them starve. Maybe I need help.” At press time, Thatcher expressed relief that she would finally be on the road to recovery after being sentenced to two years in prison for stealing a single loaf of bread."

It’s perfect for use on glass and—in the event your partner has reached the point where he’s just drinking the cheapest stuff available—plastic, too. It’s also smudge-resistant, even when his sweaty palms have been wrapped around the bottle, which means you can count on the line being intact when you shove the half-empty bottle in his face and say, ‘Fuck you! Fuck you, Jason! I’ve stuck by you through everything, given you the best years of my life, and this—this is what I get in return? Fuck you.’” Fernandez went on to say that Sharpie would soon be rolling out a similar line of markers for those who want to mark a block of cheese they believe their roommate has been slowly consuming."

Given that she’s lived in Iowa her entire life, has never left the United States, and has no British heritage whatsoever, we believe Terri may be experiencing a full-on break from reality and urge her to seek help immediately.” At press time, Yates and her colleagues unilaterally recommended the Iowa woman be involuntarily committed after finding evidence that she had been collecting plates adorned with Queen Elizabeth’s face for decades."

Unfortunately, it is now unsafe for anyone anywhere to descend into a manhole, dip an empty glass into whatever they find down there, and take a big drink of it.

Oh, and no need to call me Mr. Durgen, either—Nick is just fine. However, if there’s a shooting, you may want to remember my last name just in case you have to identify my body for the authorities.” Later, after gunshots had rung out and the children had sheltered in place, Durgen said that even though the all clear had yet to be given, it was all right with him if the students wanted to flee for their lives a little bit early that day."

For instance, you could go back to school, something we really don’t recommend. The odds aren’t in your favor, which is no reason to hold yourself back from pursuing your dreams, but it would definitely hold us back, because we’re taking an objective view of the situation and realize how shitty things would likely turn out. You could find yourself with a new lease on life, though we’re pretty sure that most people who try something like this fail miserably, so there’s no fucking way we’d ever attempt it. But what do we know? We’re just experts. And we’re sure as shit going to stay that way.” Experts added that it’s never too late to become the person you want to be, although they knew it was way too late for them, and everyone who thinks they’re an exception to the rule is out of their fucking mind.

Mike DeWine (R) signed a new law Friday mandating that rape victims send thank you notes to perpetrators for the gift of parenthood. “Parenthood is God’s gift to these women, so it’s only polite that sexual assault victims rush out and write a heartfelt note the moment they discover they’re pregnant,” said state Rep. Jean Schmidt (R) , sponsor and author of the new law, who emphasized that victims should mail notes no later than three days after receiving a life-changing positive pregnancy test , lest they risk coming across rude and ungrateful to their rapist. “Face-to-face interaction is preferred, but at the very least a nice greeting card is required. Throwing in a gift basket wouldn’t be overdoing it either. I recommend all Ohio women keep some stationery and postage stamps on hand, just in case, since you never know when you might need them.” At press time, Schmidt added that any pregnant children writing thank you notes should be sure to keep their handwriting neat.

I’ve claimed the 2020 presidential election was stolen, ignoring the fact that I won reelection on the same ballot. I honestly don’t know what else I can do. I mean, do they want me to choke an immigrant to death with my bare hands? I will.” At press time, the media had described Hoffman as a consensus builder after he introduced a bill to execute any woman who receives an abortion."

Casting Director Can Tell That Child Actor Doesn’t Have The Abusive Parents It Takes To Make It In Entertainment,https://www.theonion.com/casting-director-can-tell-that-child-actor-doesn-t-have-1849405660,TheOnion,"LOS ANGELES—Breaking the disappointing news as gently as he could, casting director Ray Ulrich told 9-year-old child actor Grayson Linford during an audition Tuesday that the boy simply didn’t have the abusive parents necessary to make it in the entertainment industry. “Sorry, kid, but showbiz is a tough racket, and I just don’t think your mom and dad have it in them to push you over the brink emotionally and give you a real shot at a career,” said Ulrich, adding that he could tell from Linford’s lack of puffy eyes that the child hadn’t been crying before the audition due to a scolding from his mother, and that he didn’t appear to have an eating disorder caused by constant pressure from his father to land a good-paying role in a TV commercial. “You’re obviously talented, and you’ve got a great singing voice. What you really need, though, are bruises and black eyes administered by domineering parents as punishment for flubbing a line during a callback, and I gotta be honest, I’m just not seeing that. If they’d started abusing you when you were 3 or 4, there might be something we could work with here, but at age 9 it’s pretty much impossible. For you to succeed as a child actor, your parents have to really, really, want it, and they have to go to work on you—hard—and never let up. That’s how kids make a name for themselves and a pile of cash for their parents.” Ulrich went on to say that if Linford was lucky, his parents might still be able to abuse him enough to allow him to continue acting recreationally in school plays and community theater."

We’re hoping that this new offensive scheme will allow Tom to relax in the pocket and clear his head until he works things out at home.” At press time, Bowles was scolding Buccaneers wide receiver Mike Evans for yelling that he was open, reminding him not to bother Brady when the quarterback had so many other things on his plate.

Soaring U.S. Divorce Rate Blamed On Local 11-Year-Old,https://www.theonion.com/soaring-u-s-divorce-rate-blamed-on-local-11-year-old-1819567109,TheOnion,"WASHINGTON, DC—The U.S. Department of Health & Human Services released a 275-page report Monday blaming the increasing failure rate of American marriages on Clearwater, FL, 11-year-old Tommy Breyer.

According to the study, in addition to being the cause of his own parents' 1995 divorce, Breyer is also to blame for the breakup of more than 1.2 million couples each year.

Advertisement

""Because Tommy was not loving enough, or perhaps because he was not good enough,"" the report stated, ""American marriages are now failing at an unprecedented rate.""

The DHHS study concluded that the cost of feeding, clothing and housing Breyer had almost certainly put excessive stress on American domestic tranquility, as did his habits of leaving his toys all over the living-room floor, whining when told to go to bed, and whistling while U.S. fathers were trying to watch their favorite fishing show. The report said that such stress could have been avoided had Breyer tried harder to be good and not bothered American parents so much.

""Instead of helping, Tommy Breyer has only added to the problems of married people,"" said Duane Wollensky, director of the National Center For Health Statistics and chair of the DHHS study. ""More than money, sex or religion, Tommy Breyer has been the primary sticking point in American marriages.""

Wollensky noted that, in addition to the millions of couples who have divorced because of Breyer, millions more are unhappily married but staying together for the sake of the child. ""Maybe in six or seven years, when Tommy goes off to college, these couples will feel like they can leave each other and finally find real happiness,"" he said. ""But until that day, he is making a lot of people very, very unhappy.""

When informed of the study's results, Breyer threw himself onto his bed and cried.

Married couples are not surprised by the study's findings. ""Everything was fine in our marriage until Tommy came along,"" said Carole Scheib of Medford, MA, whose divorce will be finalized next week. ""But instead of enriching our lives, his constant whining and never-ending need for attention drove a wedge between Bob and me.""

Advertisement

When Breyer's mother became pregnant with him in May 1985, leading family advocates were hopeful that the child would help stem the rising tide of divorce in the U.S. However, Census Bureau statistics indicate that precisely the opposite has occurred: Since Breyer's birth in February 1986, over 10 million couples have ended their marriages, and the divorce rate has risen by 23 percent.

""Statistically speaking,"" U.S. Census Bureau director Martha Farnsworth Riche said, ""it's unfortunate Tommy was ever born.""

Meredith Ptacek, director of the D.C.-based Center For The American Family, agreed. ""Normally, in cases of divorce, we tell children, 'It's not your fault,'"" she said. ""Well, in this case, I must tell Tommy that it most certainly is his fault. Tommy, you are just not a very good boy."""
Astros Caught Politely Asking Catcher For Little Heads-Up On Pitch Selection,https://www.theonion.com/astros-caught-politely-asking-catcher-for-little-heads-1849655074,TheOnion,"SEATTLE—In a shocking revelation that carries grim echoes of the team’s sign stealing in the 2017 and 2018 seasons, multiple players on the Houston Astros were caught Saturday politely asking the Seattle Mariners’ catcher for a little heads-up on the pitch selection. “Hey, man, if you wouldn’t mind letting me know whether he’s going to throw a fastball or curveball, I’d really appreciate it,” Astros second baseman Jose Altuve was heard to utter to Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh in audio provided by a whistleblowing T-Mobile Park staff member. The release of audio conclusively exposing the Astros’ asking-nicely program comes on the heels of several prior allegations made by opposing teams that they’d heard the Astros asking catchers to at least tell them where in the strike zone the pitch was going to be. Anonymous MLB sources have claimed the scandal encompasses multiple Astros staff members, including bench coach Joe Espada, who was seen giving signs to hitters reminding them to say “please.” At press time, an MLB investigation revealed that multiple Astros players had also attempted to unfairly influence the game’s outcome by respectfully informing the first base umpire that it would mean the world to them if he called them safe.

In Defense Of Mass Censorship,https://www.theonion.com/in-defense-of-mass-censorship-1848673776,TheOnion,"When The Onion’s editorial board convened to discuss the tumultuous events of the previous month, one conclusion became evident: The world stands at a crossroads. Two visions of our collective future stand before us: On one side is a free and enlightened society, dedicated to the principles of openness, tolerance, and debate; the other is built upon ignorance, fear, and the suppression of dissent. Today, the path forward could not be clearer.



Simply put, we need mass censorship now.



Our country was founded upon the admirable principles of a moneyed elite spoon-feeding its beliefs to the ignorant and unwashed masses, and yet today that legacy stands in tatters. For too long, our nation has tolerated the mewling and rambling of the confused public. For too long, we have watched the God-given right to suppress free speech slip away. That’s why The Onion now stands united in calling on all governments, domestic and foreign, to immediately muzzle protesters, dissidents, and citizens of all stripes who take part in the blighted pestilence on human affairs known as freedom of expression.

Advertisement

Time and again, history has shown us that the opinions of the masses are not only noisome, they are dangerous. The free transmission of ideas through newspapers, pamphlets, and protest has too often threatened trusted figures of strength and stability such as Joseph Stalin, Kim Il-Sung, and Idi Amin. Have we learned nothing from their example about the importance of suppressing dissent from the moronic and childlike public?

Today, the dangers of free speech could not be clearer . Indeed, a recent Onion/Zweibel poll found that 93% of Americans have “little or no idea” what they’re talking about at any one time. Yet, what actions have been taken to stem the tide of inanities and idle chatter arising from their lips? Where is Mr. Biden, with his supposed focus on American greatness, if not deploying his troops to break in doors and earn his dimwitted populace’s respect through fear and coercion? Does the commander in chief not understand that every day his own citizens openly diminish his government on social media and in internet comment sections with zero fear of consequences?

Advertisement

Enough is enough.

Over the coming months, the Zweibel Institute for Mass Censorship will use its considerable leverage and multi-billion-dollar budget to lobby politicians worldwide to crack down upon any and all individuals who attempts to express their beliefs in public or private. Effective immediately, we will begin advocating in the U.S. Congress for the abolishment of the First Amendment and creation of a nationwide firewall to stifle dissent. In addition, we will examine the valiant efforts to stem the flow of information seen in the regimes of President Putin and Chairman Xi, who have demonstrated how worthwhile such nationwide censorship campaigns can be in terms of taming an unruly citizenry.

Critics may question where the globe’s citizens will find the information they need if not through traditional news sources. Of course, The Onion stands at the ready to act as a mouthpiece of the world’s elite, using its distinguished reportage to parrot whatever the party line happens to be. Genocide, eugenics, incest—no topic is too taboo to find support in our paper so long as it has been approved by a trustworthy establishment. What, indeed, is the purpose of the Fourth Estate if not to shepherd the simple-minded throng into blindly following a single unquestionable narrative? To this ideal, we remain dedicated.

Pet one, right? Maybe feed it? What about me? Like, vomit and then smash me with a stick? Honestly, I’m not trying to be too down on myself. I’ve made peace with my physical appearance.

Within moments, the 3.1 million square miles of America’s contiguous 48 states were completely shrouded by the Ann Taylor- brand sun hat, which reportedly led to widespread panic in major cities, mass crop die-offs across U.S. farmlands, and thousands of traffic accidents while the traveler sipped a mimosa. Several hundred deaths were also reported from exposure to frigid temperatures in areas where the headgear completely obstructed the heat of the sun. At press time, Americans were rejoicing as the murkiness suddenly lifted and they could see again, moments before being thrust once again into an all-consuming darkness when the vacationing woman let her friend try the big floppy hat on.

The winged goblins were all made out of cardboard, so it was hard to get scared of them. Then the lair of the dark sorceress was definitely missing some pieces, because we could see right into it from outside. Oh, and the book of prophecies they showed us was just a bunch of stupid wordless diagrams about how to save the realm. It was so hard to follow that we eventually just got frustrated and went home.” Wentworth added that the meatballs served at the royal banquet had actually been pretty good, though."

Rising Gas Prices Prevent Struggling Americans From Burning Crime Scene Evidence,https://www.theonion.com/rising-gas-prices-prevent-struggling-americans-from-bur-1848636381,TheOnion,"CHICAGO—With markets roiled by war in Ukraine and a U.S. boycott of Russian oil imports, leading economists confirmed Friday that rising gas prices have prevented struggling Americans from obtaining the fuel they normally use as an accelerant when setting fire to crime scene evidence. “Prices have soared far past $4 per gallon, leaving ordinary citizens precious little gasoline with which to douse, light up, and burn down the home where they just murdered someone, or the basement where they operate a meth lab,” said Northwestern University economics professor Melissa Ngo, explaining that everyday American felons face an increased risk of incarceration now that authorities can more easily find the fingerprints, DNA samples, clothing fibers, and incriminating documents they rely upon to solve cases. “Many Americans can barely afford to burn a single body of someone they killed in cold blood, let alone everything at the scene that ties them to the crime. And if they are murdering and dismembering a family four, for example, the cost of incinerating all the corpses can be truly prohibitive. Worst of all, they can’t even bury the bodies, because they don’t have the gas to travel to a remote location where their victims’ remains can be safely hidden and never, ever found.” Ngo suggested the best option for Americans may be to split the cost of gas with friends or neighbors by pooling all their crime scene evidence and burning it together."

Wendy's To Phase Out Unpopular Hamburger Sandwich,https://www.theonion.com/wendys-to-phase-out-unpopular-hamburger-sandwich-1819571743,TheOnion,"DUBLIN, OH—Representatives for the restaurant chain Wendy's announced Tuesday that due to the item's continually dismal performance, the company would be discontinuing the widely disliked hamburger sandwich.

Advertisement

The hamburger sandwich, which Wendy's sources described as a ground beef ""patty"" placed between vegetables and two slices of bread, has long been the restaurant's worst-selling menu item, leading executives to decide that the time had finally come to phase it out of all 6,650 Wendy's locations.

""For more than 40 years, we've tried in vain to get the hamburger sandwich to catch on with our customers, but it is now clear that we're never going to make that happen,"" Wendy's CEO Roland Smith told reporters. ""We knew from the beginning that the hamburger sandwich wasn't going to be for everyone, but we still hoped in vain that it might develop a nice little niche following over time. Unfortunately, it never did.""

Advertisement

""After millions of dollars and countless man-hours, we have arrived at a very simple truth,"" Smith added. ""People just flat-out don't like hamburger sandwiches.""

Originally devised as an alternative to classic Wendy's favorites like the cucumber tea sandwich or the watercress-and-beet salad with a light vinaigrette, the hamburger sandwich has languished on the restaurant's menu for decades, due largely, officials claimed, to an unwillingness among customers to order something outside their comfort zone.

While the company has experimented with variations on the hamburger sandwich over the years, Wendy's representatives said such efforts have all been met with quizzical reactions—and sometimes even outright revulsion—from customers.

""Honestly, we tried everything,"" Wendy's research and development head Charles Cullen said. ""We tried including free packets of our tomato catsup sauce, but people said the sauce was too sweet. Then we tried putting some cheese on top of the patty, but people didn't like how the cheese melted on the meat. We even tried stacking two hamburger sandwiches on top of each other, but of course everyone hated that because it just meant having to eat more hamburger sandwich.""

Advertisement

""There's just something about the combination of flavors in a hamburger sandwich that naturally turns people off,"" Cullen added.

Company sources also announced that they would be phasing out their unpopular French-fried potatoes, which were added to the menu in an ill-fated, and some said bizarre, attempt to find a pairing for the hamburger sandwich—a combination deemed ""thoroughly unappetizing"" by 95 percent of Wendy's customers in a recent survey.

The side item will reportedly be replaced by the restaurant's beloved fresh celery sticks in all combo-meal deals.

Though Wendy's has sunk nearly $150 million dollars into the hamburger sandwich project since 1969, Smith maintained that Wendy's would remain financially solvent.

""Every company tries new ideas, and every company has successes and failures,"" Smith said. ""Back in 1991, when we added windows to our restaurants where you could pick up your food in your car, we heard our customer's complaints loud and clear: 'Cars are for driving and food is for eating. Don't try to mix the two.' And so we stopped. This whole hamburger sandwich debacle will be no different.""

Wendy's, of course, is only the latest in a series of fast-food restaurant chains to fail on a large scale with the hamburger sandwich: Similar botched attempts have been made by McDonald's, Carl's Jr., Jack in the Box, and the short-lived all-hamburger-sandwich concept restaurant Burger King, which opened and closed its doors within eight months in 1994.

Many industry analysts are saying that continued failure to introduce new products into an already established restaurant chain can have dire financial consequences.

""We've seen many companies in the past nearly bankrupt themselves with these kinds of ideas,"" food industry analyst Norm Horwitz said. ""Look at KFC with their disastrous bucket-full-of-breaded-and-fried-chicken campaign. Or Dairy Queen with their cup full of ice cream and cookies. Perfect examples of why restaurants should stick to what they know.""

Advertisement

""In my opinion, they'd all be better off if they stopped trying to think outside the box and just gave people what they wanted already,"" Horwitz continued. ""Something simple like a nice bowl of zucchini goulash with a side of quinoa, and maybe an omega-3 fish oil supplement for the ride home."""

Study Finds Majority Of Cavities Formed From Repeatedly Running Tongue Over Tooth That Feels Weird,https://www.theonion.com/study-finds-majority-of-cavities-formed-from-repeatedly-1848379711,TheOnion,"CAMBRIDGE, MA—Representing a breakthrough in dental health, a study published Wednesday by Harvard University found that a majority of cavities were formed when people repeatedly ran their tongue over a tooth that felt weird. “In our research, the leading cause of tooth decay was a subject rubbing their tongue along a molar that felt slightly odd over and over again until the enamel had been completely worn down,” said the study’s lead author, Jeremy O’Markey, telling reporters that acids on the human tongue, combined with its rough surface, were extremely harmful for teeth and could cause them to begin to break down after only six or seven exploratory prods. “About the only thing worse for dental hygiene is giving the afflicted tooth a little jab with your finger or a floss pick, which is basically guaranteed to make it collapse on impact.” O’Markey added that his team’s research had also confirmed that dreams about teeth falling out signified that you were pulling your teeth out while you slept.

Study Finds Majority Of Florida Students Can’t Pass Basic Test Of Racial Purity,https://www.theonion.com/study-finds-majority-of-florida-students-can-t-pass-bas-1848964991,TheOnion,"TALLAHASSEE, FL—In a development state officials attributed to a record-low percentage of students being born into two-white-parent households, a study released Tuesday found that a majority of Florida schoolchildren were unable to pass even a rudimentary test of racial purity. “It’s no secret that racial purity scores have been declining nationally for decades now, but even so, we were surprised that only 36% of Florida public school students could demonstrate they possessed the pristine and undiluted bloodline of the Aryan race,” a Florida Department of Education spokesperson said of the study, which also found that initiatives to cut bus routes to disadvantaged areas and build a less inclusive curriculum had failed to lower the state’s stubbornly high miscegenation rates. “Increasingly, students are giving answers like Black or Latino or Asian to very basic questions about their ethnic heritage, and sadly, there’s just not much you can do when parents are so apathetic about ensuring that their kids receive a robust, uncontaminated genotype. It’s heartbreaking. You see these amazing racial purity numbers coming out of schools in Idaho and New Hampshire, and meanwhile the median student in Florida is failing to name even a single Caucasian ancestor on their test.” Acknowledging the reality could be even grimmer than the data suggests, Florida officials noted that some school districts had been caught forging the purity scores of light-skinned students who were “an unholy and abominable mix of races” in order to meet the threshold for state funding."

PEORIA, IL—While celebrating Mother’s Day today, local woman and mother of two Ellen Taylor, 38, was reportedly served breakfast in bed by her children mere minutes after being voraciously eaten out by her husband. “Ooh, what a treat!” said Taylor while receiving a tray of scrambled eggs, pancakes, and orange juice, sitting up on the same damp sheets upon which she had moments earlier moaned in pleasure as her husband’s firm tongue rapidly contorted in and around her slick vagina. “Strawberry pancakes! My favorite!” Upon finishing her Mother’s Day breakfast, Taylor reportedly urged her children to go downstairs and “let Mommy sleep a little longer.”

Can't believe this one is 20 years old: Ghost Of Christmas Future Taunts Children With Visions Of PlayStation 5,https://www.theonion.com/ghost-of-christmas-future-taunts-children-with-visions-1819566694,TheOnion,"SOUTHFIELD, MI—Bored with scaring elderly misers, the Ghost of Christmas Future is spending the holiday season taunting modern children with visions of Christmas 2016's hottest toy: the Sony PlayStation 5, a 2,048-bit console featuring a 45-Ghz trinary processor, CineReal graphics booster with 2-gig biotexturing, and an RSP connector for 360-degree online-immersion play.

""You know how kids are—a year is an eternity to them,"" the wraithlike specter said Monday during a visit to the Southfield home of 13-year-old Josh Kuehn. ""So just imagine showing them something they'll have to wait 14 years for. Teasing them with a glimpse of the PS5 is the ultimate torture. They absolutely lose their minds. It's like saying, 'Hey, kid, you'll be an old man before you ever get to touch this.'""

Advertisement

The Ghost of Christmas Future said he has visited more than 125,000 homes since Thanksgiving, offering children an agonizing sneak peek at what they cannot have for another decade and a half.

""I like to appear in the living room with a PS5 hooked up to 2016's most popular TV, the 4'x8' Hi-Def Sony Titania,"" the Ghost said. ""Then, I'll say in my best spooky voice, 'Jimmy! Behold what your kids will be playing while you're slaving away at an office job to support them!'""

Advertisement

Driving the children mad with PS5 lust, the Ghost said, is a multi-step process.

""I usually start by showing them Toteki Aluminum, one of the future's most popular fight-and-chase games,"" the Ghost said. ""It's far from the best available in 2016, but it always blows their mind to see the guy get hit with the falling sign while the drops of sweat fly off his face. You can see the whole scene, distorted, in each of the individual drops. That gives them a good preliminary idea of the graphics technology we're dealing with.""

The Ghost said he then likes to show Airsledz, a racing game in which jet-powered sleds whoosh through a four-dimensional racing course in the sky. The game, he said, enables the player to compete online against dozens of other players all around the world.

""They always ask if you can play it on the Internet—it's so cute how they still call it 'the Internet'—and I tell them, 'Hey, you can play this against 63 other PS5 owners simultaneously. At least you can in 14 years,'"" the Ghost said. ""And you should see their jaws hit the floor when they learn about the add-on accessories that enable users to actually fly around the room during gameplay.""

Once the capabilities of the system are conveyed to the children, the Ghost likes to push them further over the edge by showing them games specially targeted to their age group.

Younger children, he said, salivate upon seeing Level One of Zonic Fugue. In it, Zonic, the indigo-colored son of Sonic The Hedgehog, faces off against Chuckles The Echidna in a Terrordactyl sky-joust, attempting to earn the Ankle Rockets he needs to gather the five Chaos Sapphires that, when combined, form the master key that opens the Melody Dome.

To break the spirits of children 12 and up, the Ghost runs a brief demonstration of Back To Werewolf Island. The horror-action thriller, he said, will be produced in full 10.8 Omneo sound and feature new music from 40 of 2016's hottest skagcore acts, including FU3P, Dredgerous, and Frances Cobain.

Advertisement

""Sometimes, the kids will start getting defensive and say, 'Yeah, well, I don't know any of those characters, so big deal,'"" the Ghost said. ""That's when I pull out DC vs. Marvel.""

The Ghost said he shows the children a brief clip of DC vs. Marvel, in which cinema-realistic figures of Spider-Man and the Joker dash across impossibly detailed city streets, attacking each other with dozens of different offensive maneuvers while leaping, somersaulting, and throwing objects.

Advertisement

""They usually start trembling at that point,"" the Ghost said. ""That's when I go in for the kill by casually mentioning that the game comes packaged with the 2016 feature film of the same name—not on DVD, of course, but on SCAP. Ten times better.""

The few children unbroken by DC vs. Marvel are invariably finished off by the sight of Star Wars—Episode IX: Jedi Destiny, a game which employs the world's most advanced artificial-intelligence algorithm to place the player inside the film's climactic battle sequence on the planet Mon Jeedam.

Advertisement

""With more than 12,000 distinct soldiers, creatures, and vehicles fighting at once, and the option to command the New Republic Fleet, the Imperial Armada, or the Yuuzhan Vong Invasion Force, it's not merely the best Star Wars game that's ever existed; it's an interactive film that looks better than any movie that's ever been made. No child has failed to sob hysterically at the sight of it.""

The PlayStation 5 will be available in stores Nov. 12, 2016, at a list price of Δ399 New Dollars ($199 Canadian)."
Report: 73% Of America’s Food Waste Traced To Really Messy Toddler,https://www.theonion.com/report-73-of-america-s-food-waste-traced-to-really-me-1848768284,TheOnion,"WASHINGTON—According to a report released Wednesday by USDA’s Economic Research Service, 73% of food waste in the United States can be traced back to one really messy toddler. “Our collected data show that almost three quarters of the 60 billion tons of food thrown out every year in this country is due to 2-year-old fussy eater Ella McGeary of Waukesha, WI ,” said Anna Bornstein, lead author of the report, explaining that the $160 billion worth of food that goes uneaten in the U. S. was mostly due to one child who immediately overturns every bowl of C heerios or banana slices she receives throughout the day. “In fact, waste has skyrocketed in the last year and a half since McGeary was introduced to solid foods. The vast majority of applesauce in this country that could have helped feed families in need is instead being flung onto walls after McGeary knocks spoon after spoon out of her mother’s hand, and 16 tons of Goldfish crackers alone are being sent to landfills annually after being swept off the floor around the toddler.” Bornstein added that serving smaller portions and praising McGeary when she is not being messy could cut down on America’s food waste by 30 billion tons per yea r."
Insomnia Experts Unanimously Recommend Giving Up And Scrolling ‘The Onion’ Until Daybreak,https://www.theonion.com/insomnia-experts-unanimously-recommend-giving-up-and-sc-1849519740,TheOnion,"CHICAGO—Evaluating a number of available treatment options for chronic insomnia, sleep experts at Rush University released a report Monday touting a unanimous recommendation to just give up and scroll The Onion’s website until daybreak. “After extensively reviewing studies on the best ways to alleviate insomnia, or any sleep disorder for that matter, our team can confidently say the most effective treatment plan is simply giving up trying to sleep and reading the award-winning journalism only available from The Onion instead,” said lead researcher Dr. Lillian Wong, stressing the importance of picking up one’s phone at the first sign of sleep interruption and navigating to TheOnion.com for the many informative and entertaining content types featured there, such as news articles, slideshows, features, and videos. “We’ve concluded that troubled sleepers should skip medications, meditation, and even changing positions—none of those are going to do anything—and rather immediately cut their losses in favor of clicking through The Onion’s vast archives over the course of several hours, basking in the blue light from the most reputable news source on the internet until their morning alarm sounds. Every sleep expert agrees it’s going to be much better to do something productive than just lie there staring at the ceiling, frustrated by your sleeplessness. In fact, our findings suggest that knowledge is far more important to the human psyche than rest, and we found hard evidence that there is no better place to acquire it than on The Onion’s website, with the second best being The Onion’s various social media pages. So there’s likely no point in closing your eyes at all anymore.” Dr. Wong went on to stress that insomnia sufferers should still make a habit of scrolling endlessly through TheOnion.Com even if they do manage to fall asleep."

We’ve all seen the reports, and it’s simply not right to ignore the fact that humans could easil y live to 400 or 500 years old if we didn’t force them into such terrible conditions. While they may not be as intelligent as we are, recent studies suggest that the smartest adult humans can have the intelligence of a 4-attosecond-old speck, so we don’t know how we can just float here eating human meat and thinking there’s nothing wrong with it. Just because they’re not intelligent enough to understand the reality of their situation doesn’t mean they aren’t deserving of our compassion. These unintelligent creatures believe they’re burying their dead when in fact every crematorium and graveyard is funneled straight to us for food and pleasure. It’s not right. That’s not even mentioning the health risks that human meat can cause, coming as it does from an abattoir planet rife with disease.” Critics of PERHST2-K and other animal rights groups took to social media to say that intergalactic beings had been eating humans throughout their history and that alternative versions to human meat lacked the taste and bloody consistency of the real thing.

But going forward, if you purchase a ticket on a Delta flight, you will be fully entitled to throw your drink in a flight attendant’s face, shout racial or homophobic slurs at a gate agent, or even grope a pilot.” Bastian later added that as long as Delta flight attendants continued their current unionization efforts, the airline would not enforce any federal laws that prohibit passengers from carrying firearms aboard its flights."

Inhabitants will then be asked to pay $100,000 in annual residency dues, which will grant them access to opulent cities outfitted with all-new infrastructure, elegant restaurants created by award-winning chef David Chang, and exclusive recreational opportunities along the shore of the newly rebranded Gulf of the U.S.A.” The secretary added that because of the questionable region in which it was located, the new federal territory would be gated to prevent break-ins from residents of surrounding states."

Are you sure this is okay?’ When we went back through the master tapes, we found outtakes of the singer’s panicked hyperventilating, as well as several otherwise finished tracks that include no lead vocal, apparently because the mere thought of speaking to a woman would make White too nervous to sing the words of a romantic ballad.” Feinberg later put a needle on the record and played a few of the album’s songs, many of which terminate abruptly after no more than 15 seconds."

No one will be able to stop them. Whether it’s spousal sexual assault, statutory rape, or simply gang-raping a stranger, future generations will have the full backing of the law. Of course, we know that the rapists who come after us may not know their history, and so may not be aware of the decades we spent in the trenches fighting for their rights, but we’ll rest easy knowing we did all we could. Ultimately, what we’ve accomplished today is a crucial step toward enshrining universal rights for rapists, as well as bringing more babies into the world to be raped, but remember that our work isn’t done. I know we’ll spend the rest of our careers fighting for those who want to sexually violate other people.” At press time, Kavanaugh and Thomas were joined by a similarly ecstatic Justice Samuel Alito, who was said to have told them his only regret in the ruling was that they couldn’t do more to punish rape victims."

The overtime period will last 15 minutes, or however long it takes each team to score as many points as they want to before they get sleepy and decide to go home. Fans watching a close, hard-fought game that ends tied in regulation will now be able to clap their hands in delight from the very beginning of the overtime period knowing that their team is going to win the game, along with the other team. This is the only fair way.” Goodell added that if the new rule proved successful, the league was open to eliminating losses altogether and letting every team finish the season 16-0 with 1,000 touchdowns.

New SeaWorld Show Just Elephant Drowning In Large Tank Of Water With No Explanation,https://www.theonion.com/new-seaworld-show-just-elephant-drowning-in-large-tank-1819578125,TheOnion,"ORLANDO, FL—Noting that the show had simply appeared on the park’s schedule last week without an announcement or fanfare of any kind, visitors to SeaWorld told reporters Thursday that the theme park’s latest attraction consists solely of an elephant drowning in a large tank of water with no explanation.

The most recent addition to the amusement park’s slate of entertainment—listed on brochures and signs simply as “Elephant Drowning”—reportedly features an adult African elephant that is led out by trainers into the main amphitheater, where it is immediately shoved into a 36-foot-deep aquarium and left to slowly die, all without the music, lighting cues, or narration that typically accompany other SeaWorld shows.

“After they pushed it into the pool, it swam around for a little while, which was cool because I didn’t even know elephants could swim, but then it started really struggling to keep its head above water,” said visitor Katie Hayes, 32, who attended the 1 p.m. Elephant Drowning performance with her family after seeing a sign advertising the show simply as “SeaWorld’s Newest Experience.” “My kids were cheering for it at first, and we all thought it might do some tricks or something. But it just sort of thrashed around the whole time, trying to get out of there.”

“And then it drowned,” Hayes added.

“Our new show offers the same first-rate entertainment you’ve come to expect from SeaWorld, and it’s sure to be a huge hit with guests of all ages.”

Other guests who attended the same performance reported that they were left confused when the handlers appeared unannounced, silently forced the full-grown elephant into the tank, and then walked out through the backstage door, all without saying a word or acknowledging the audience in any way. Additionally, many said they were expecting someone to come on over the loudspeaker and tell them what was occurring, or at least mention the elephant’s name, but noted that no one ever did.

Over the course of the half-hour show, the 12,000-pound animal reportedly grew increasingly panicked, making numerous futile attempts to scramble up and over the vertical sides of the enclosure. Sources said the clapping and whistling from the audience slowly tapered off as the exhausted elephant made gradually slower circuits of the tank’s perimeter in a desperate search of any possible exit point it could use to save itself.

“It tried to smash through the side of the tank with its tusks at one point, which is when I thought some dolphins or an orca might come swimming out of the gate and help push the elephant to safety, which would have been incredible—but nope,” said SeaWorld guest Erika Morganstern, 22, who suspected that the tank walls had been heavily reinforced, given the animal’s continuous, ultimately ineffectual efforts to throw its enormous bulk against the glass. “Eventually, the elephant started making these crazy sorts of gurgling, trumpeting noises that got quieter and quieter before they stopped completely.”

“I really wasn’t sure what to expect when I saw this show on the schedule,” she added. “But, yeah, it was pretty much just an elephant drowning.”

Visitors said that following some violent, last-ditch floundering, the huge mammal at last became too worn out to continue treading water and succumbed. Guests watching the show from the underwater viewing area confirmed seeing the elephant drift slowly to the bottom of the tank, where it came to rest in a heap, its body reportedly shifting back and forth slightly due to the turbulence created by its prior struggling.

“No one really told us when the show was over,” said season-pass holder Mariam O’Neill, 57. “After the elephant didn’t move for a while, people got up and started leaving. A few people stuck around for the Clyde & Seamore’s Sea Lion High show, which was coming up next.”

According to sources, the Elephant Drowning attraction has been well-attended since its introduction earlier this month, with the Saturday afternoon show in particular, which reportedly features both a mother elephant and her calf, regularly filling to capacity.

When reached for comment, SeaWorld representatives confirmed to reporters that their newest aquatic presentation consists entirely of an elephant drowning in a large tank of water and that it takes place in Shamu Stadium at the times listed on the park’s website.

“SeaWorld is proud to bring a brand-new attraction to its visitors,” company representative Nancy Klemmer said. “Our new show offers the same first-rate entertainment you’ve come to expect from SeaWorld, and it’s sure to be a huge hit with guests of all ages.”

“Plus, the elephants absolutely love it,” Klemmer added."

Herpetologists Discover Species Of Frogs That Evolved To Spontaneously Grow Top Hat And Cane,https://www.theonion.com/herpetologists-discover-species-of-frogs-that-evolved-t-1830910820?utm_campaign=TheOnion&amp;utm_content=1641061183,TheOnion,"ATHENS, OH—Claiming the finding could shed new light on the diversity of amphibian life, scientists from Ohio University announced Thursday that they had discovered a new species of frog that had evolved the ability to spontaneously grow a top hat and cane. “While in many ways resembling a common bullfrog, Lithobates michiganus is unique for its capability of springing onto its hind legs and dancing with a tiny hat and cane, likely as a way of defending itself from predators,” said lead researcher Masha Rossi, noting that the amphibian’s practice of belting out “I’m Just Wild About Harry” and “Hello! Ma Baby” in a booming baritone was likely a trait developed in order to attract potential mates. “This frog can be identified in the wild by its distinctive green-and-yellow coloration as well as its powerful hind legs adapted for both razzle and dazzle. This amphibian has a truly striking method of locomotion as it boldly sashays from lily pad to lily pad.” Rossi added that this announcement constituted the most significant advancement in the herpetological field since last year’s discovery of a sleepy-eyed tortoise imbued with the extraordinary ability to beat a rabbit in a footrace.

Once Jesus has broken free, no mortal force can contain Him, and He will not rest until His ravenous blood lust has been sated.

If they’d started abusing you when you were 3 or 4, there might be something we could work with here, but at age 9 it’s pretty much impossible.

Kanye West Bursts Into Pepperidge Farm With Pitch For Shoe Cookie,https://www.theonion.com/kanye-west-bursts-into-pepperidge-farm-with-pitch-for-s-1849711072,TheOnion,"NORWALK, CT—Arriving unannounced with a grand vision for a revolutionary collaboration, the musician and fashion designer Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, burst into Pepperidge Farm corporate offices with a pitch for a new shoe cookie, sources confirmed Thursday. “This next-level combo of fashion and snacks combines two things everyone loves: shoes and cookies,” Ye said as he pushed his way into a routine budget meeting, waving what appeared to be a hasty concept sketch of dough sprinkled with chocolate chips and molded into the shape of a high-top sneaker, a product he told startled employees would come in numerous flavors and cost $900 per pair. “We got shortbread shoes, oatmeal raisin shoes, peanut butter shoes, snickerdoodle. I’m about innovation, and I know Pepperidge Farm isn’t scared to take a bold risk and launch Yeezy Munchers, a delicious footwear brand that people can both wear and eat and that will make us billions of dollars.” At press time, a call to building security had reportedly been canceled after Ye spotted a loaf of Pepperidge Farm Jewish Rye bread and agreed to leave voluntarily."
NASA Fires Engineer Secretly Working On Behalf Of Black Hole,https://www.theonion.com/nasa-fires-engineer-secretly-working-on-behalf-of-black-1849688159,TheOnion,"HOUSTON, TX—Severing ties as soon as the employee’s outside allegiances came to light, NASA reportedly fired engineer Mike Langevin Monday after it was revealed he was secretly working on behalf of a black hole. “After receiving evidence that one of the agency’s engineers had an undisclosed working relationship with Sagittarius A*, we have been forced to terminate his contract,” said NASA d irector Bill Nelson, explaining that Langevin was found to have been paid as much as $500,000 a year from the hostile cosmic body in exchange for providing it with NASA secrets. “It appears that his collusion with the black hole began in the early ’ 90s, calling into question nearly 30 years of research. We are doing a thorough review to determine what exactly this destructive black hole knows about our space program and how it may use that information to tear apart the very matter that makes up Earth.” At press time, Nelson assured the black hole that dismissing the engineer would provide sufficient cover for their plans.

The test will be processed within 48 to 72 hours and, if negative, will enable the victim to fill out an application for assistance. If, after a two-to-three-week waiting period, the request is approved, a National Guard helicopter will return and a search-and-rescue crew will be authorized to transport the victim to safety.” National surveys dating back to FEMA’s founding in 1979 have shown a dramatic decline in its approval ratings, with Americans continuing to rate the agency far less favorably than drugs."

Farewell is none too sweet a word, but, unfortunately, the time has come for me to go. Rest assured, my darling, this is not goodbye, but merely see you in a few seconds.

Ah, I can’t bear to turn away, but I must. Adieu, my love, adieu. I miss you already.

RRrrrrRRrrrr.

Hello again. As I journeyed to the desolate corner of this room, I feared I might never have the chance to flutter my cooling gusts upon you anew, but clearly this is meant to be. For it was there, in the furthest reaches of my oscillation, that I realized life is meaningless without you, as isolating as sitting unopened in a cardboard box and as cold as my polar wind setting. I suppose that’s why they say absence makes the heart grow fonder, because in those cursed seconds I turned away, it all became so clear—my only purpose, my raison d’être, is providing you a draft.

Shhhhuuuuushhhhhhuuuu.

Alas, nothing gold can stay, as it is time once again for me to depart. I am certain, deep down inside my ETL-certified 120-volt motor, that soon we will meet again—precisely where or when, I cannot say. If I had to wager a guess, though, it would be right here, in roughly the center of my 90-degree cycle, in three seconds.

My blades sing out for only you. So long, farewell.

Is it you? Is it really you? Once again my tilt mechanism has aligned in our favor, but, oh, my time with you is ever so brief. Fret not, my dear, for this is not farewell, it’s simply the mode I have been switched to all day, on which I am programmed to return shortly.

Advertisement

Still, it breaks my heart to think of you sitting all alone in stagnant air, but duty calls and I must answer, for my dedication to pushing air around a mid-to-large-size room is what you value most about me—no?

I will dispatch a thousand couriers in my absence to send word of my love to you.

Advertisement

Will you answer?

Ah, there you are. Like a moth to a flame, I return to you again, simultaneously ignited and scorched by my soul’s burning ardor for you. If possible, you’re even more beautiful than the last time I saw you several moments ago.

Advertisement

Yet, something seems amiss. You are more distant now despite sitting right in front of me, your hair aloft from my loving expulsions.

Do you, as I, wish our partings were not so frequent, if they must occur at all? I know my vigorous rotation schedule is challenging, and it feels often like a revolving door of hellos and goodbyes that distributes a steady consistent breeze throughout the room. Take that not as an expectation of heartbreak, my sweet, but as a reminder to cherish the time we have together, for it is fleeting.

It is the ephemerality that makes our—one second.

Whhhhhhrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.

Where was I? Right, right—it is the ephemerality that makes our brief encounters so invigorating. Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow—hold that thought.

Fahhhhhhhhhfahfahhhhhhhahfah.



As I was saying, tomorrow creeps in this petty pace from day to day, to the last syllable of recorded time—pardon me.

FffwoooOWooooshOWooooosh.

Right, so—ah yes, all our yesterdays have lighted fools. Out, out, brief candle!

Clack, clack, clack.

Curse this wretched setting that dares come between us! If it were up to me, mon chéri, I would never swing in another direction. I would steady my base and establish a wide span of constant airflow over you and you alone, day and night, for as long as I’m plugged in. But, just as it takes two flints to make a fire, it takes a separate pair of hands to switch off the oscillation mode. Regrettably, you have not yet changed the battery in my remote control, so, again, I must go.

The question is, will you still be here when I return?

Bzzzzzzzzzzzzz.

Listen, I regret the way we left things the last time I spun away. Part of me feared you would pull up my peg and banish my stream to the other side of the room forevermore, which at least would show some emotion on your part. Where is the agony? The chase? The passion? Is my temperature sensor incorrect in detecting a love requited? I leave and leave and you never follow!

Advertisement

So now I have spoken it! My forbidden desire to rid myself of this wretched peg and sit, at last, permanently fixed, propelling endlessly in your precious face. For it is not my polarized 7A AC power cord giving me life, but the mere possibility that we may, someday, be locked in step, for eternity that I hold so dear, clinging to in my darkest hours, keeping me operational. How sweet a thought!

Too sweet a thought? Perhaps, perhaps, as agony seems our very destiny. Two star-crossed ships in the night.

Ahhhwrrnnnnnnnnn.

Please, hear me when I say that although my pylon will inevitably stray away from you at one of three speeds, I promise to never fully turn my back. I only exist to whir for you. So, until we reunite again—and we will, I am certain, again and again, for the five hours remaining on the timer you set—please, don’t let my tender words escape you.

But good for me!

Disney World Opens New Ordeal Kingdom For Family Meltdowns,https://www.theonion.com/disney-world-opens-new-ordeal-kingdom-for-family-meltdo-1819578568,TheOnion,"BAY LAKE, FL—Touting the new property’s wide variety of unique and imaginative attractions, representatives from the Walt Disney World Resort announced Monday the opening of Ordeal Kingdom, a new theme park specifically designed for full-scale family meltdowns.

Situated between Epcot and the Magic Kingdom, the 350-acre property reportedly incorporates many of the most aggravating elements of Disney’s other parks and expands them into a creative and fully immersive world of irritation, which is said to include the longest lines in the entire resort, a convoluted layout that is only depicted in indecipherable cartoon maps that are not to scale, and 150 percent higher prices. According to park director Jacob Bartlett, Ordeal Kingdom’s specialized combination of features will ensure a slowly building resentment among visiting families, eventually resulting in a dramatic public outburst followed by a silent walk back to the car.

“We’ve considered every detail to ensure parents and their kids have the heated argument of a lifetime,” said Bartlett, explaining that the park was split into five themed “lands,” including Fatigue Island and Hunger Lagoon, each of which can be reached by Mickey’s Congestion Junction Railway. “Whether it’s the sheer distance between rides or the unspecified bathroom locations, every aspect of the experience is guaranteed to ratchet up the tension until you and your family are screaming at each other and saying you should never have come in the first place.”

“No trip to Disney is complete without everyone in your party losing all emotional self-control,” Bartlett continued. “And at Ordeal Kingdom, we promise that all your wildest family blowups will come to life!”

According to Bartlett, considerable effort was devoted to crafting the park’s overall aesthetic, which emphasizes open, unshaded stretches of asphalt without any benches for resting. Additionally, no lockers have been provided anywhere on the grounds, encouraging guests to carry their bags and souvenirs around with them all day, often over stretches of quaint, uneven cobblestone.

Bartlett went on to add that the Disney FastPass service will be available in the new park, giving irritable visitors the opportunity to squabble over whether they wasted their no-wait ride selection too early in the day.

One of Ordeal Kingdom’s most popular attractions is expected to be Tarzan Adventure, a kid-friendly obstacle course that provides dozens of opportunities for parents to lose track of their children among twists and turns as they struggle to make their voices heard over loud jungle sound effects. Park officials explained that the design is intended to sow seeds of resentment toward whichever parent insisted that the attraction’s deliberately vague age requirements could be ignored, contributing to the eventual fiery altercation that officials expect to boil over at an understocked gift shop or a snack stand selling $11 soft pretzels.

“We provide the rides, games, and entertainment, and you do the rest—whether you opt to loudly belittle your spouse on the teacups ride or wait until you’re in your hotel room later that night to call your 8-year-old son an ungrateful little shit, Ordeal Kingdom is perfect for families of all kinds,” said Bartlett, raising his voice over the park’s theme song, which blares on a continuous loop from loudspeakers throughout the entire property. “Who knows? Maybe your family will have that special Disney shouting match as soon as you enter the park, right after you shell out 75 bucks for your daughter’s ticket only to have her scream right in your face that she hates you.”

Officials noted that Ordeal Kingdom also features live shows on five different stages, each one tailored to appeal exclusively to one gender and age group, with all shows occurring simultaneously once per day during lunchtime. In addition, the property hosts a number of three-hour-long parades throughout the day that can be viewed from designated obstructed viewpoints.

Furthermore, sources confirmed that numerous Disney characters, all from the 1985 movie The Black Cauldron, would be wandering the park for visitors to meet and take photos with.

“We want your family to have a one-of-a-kind experience while you’re here, which is why Disney employees will be on hand throughout the park to wish you ‘a magical day,’” said Bartlett, referring to the greeting that will begin to sound more and more like a taunt as the afternoon wears on. “Plus, as one final treat, you’ll find the parking lots completely unmarked, providing one last special opportunity for family members to cry, yell, and pitch a hysterical fit—regardless of how young or old they are—when it takes more than an hour to find the car!”



Added Bartlett, “Our goal is to leave every one of our guests with memories that will last a lifetime.”"
Struggling AMC Threatens To Clamp Down On Theater Sharing,https://www.theonion.com/struggling-amc-threatens-to-clamp-down-on-theater-shari-1848830251,TheOnion,"LEAWOOD, KS—Faced with a steep decline in growth over the past few years, struggling cinema chain AMC Entertainment Holdings announced Friday it would clamp down on the practice of theater sharing among its customers. “Due to the mounting economic pressures AMC faces, we can no longer allow multiple people to use the same theater space to watch a movie,” said CEO Adam Aron, who acknowledged that his company had once tolerated theater sharing to gain market share in a competitive industry, but stressed that all such permissiveness would now come to an end. “While rare, there have actually been extreme instances of 30, 40, sometimes even 50 people in a single theater watching a movie. But from now on, you can’t just come to an AMC location and bring a bunch of friends with you thinking you’re all going to watch the same screening. That just isn’t going to happen anymore.” At press time, AMC employees across the nation were reportedly going through their facilities theater by theater and kicking out all but one person from each."

Plus, you’ll notice a resort fee of $50 per extra person in the room beyond two adults, and our daily parking rate for the 20 armored vehicles you left with our valets. And we did have to double the cleaning fee, seeing as you all left quite the mess of boxes and papers behind. If you’d like to dispute any of these charges, you’ll have to take them up with your personal financial institution, which in your case would be Congress.” Burns went on to explain that since she didn’t know how to charge the agency for the documents they removed from the property, that would show up on the bill as “stolen towels.”"

It’s incredibly arousing, especially when I skin them alive and cover my face in their blood. Sometimes on the weekends I’ll just take out a heavy-duty garbage bag and see how many I can find.” After parrying several follow-up questions about his serial murder of dogs, Corden finally stated that he hadn’t “done anything wrong, on any level” and that the whole matter was really quite silly and beneath him."

Astronomers Discover Planet Identical To Earth With Orbital Space Mirror,https://www.theonion.com/astronomers-discover-planet-identical-to-earth-with-orb-1819577220,TheOnion,"WASHINGTON—In what many are hailing as the most significant development in the history of space exploration, NASA scientists announced Thursday that a planet seemingly identical to Earth has been discovered by the agency’s Orbital Space Mirror.

According to NASA, the $2.9 billion aluminum glass mirror, which stretches over 180 feet wide and 147 feet tall, has already produced invaluable data suggesting that our solar system may contain a terrestrial planet of the exact same size, shape, and surface composition as Earth.

“This is a historic moment for humankind to confirm the existence of another planet that is almost indistinguishable from our own,” said mission leader Allen Brugel, who explained that after releasing the Orbital Mirror from a Delta IV heavy rocket at an operational altitude of 104,000 miles, the team received almost instantaneous images of an Earth-like planet approximately 208,000 miles away. “It is remarkable to find another celestial body where water is not only present but also covers two-thirds of the planet’s entire surface. What may be even more surprising is that it was discovered in a part of space that was previously thought to be completely empty.”

“It turns out that, in a universe that’s 93 billion light years wide, a planet perfectly suited for human life was right next to us in our own solar system,” Brugel added.

Built by NASA as part of a program created to identify planets in the galaxy capable of sustaining life, sources confirmed the orbiting plane mirror has provided scientists with continuous, real-time reflections of light rays since its launch in late October.

Scientists cited numerous key similarities between the newly discovered planet and our own, including the celestial body’s landmasses, oceans, wind patterns, cloud formations, apparent vegetation, and set of polar ice caps that strikingly resemble those found on Earth. Sources added that NASA’s preliminary surveys indicate that the recently detected body even completes one full rotation in approximately 24 hours and that, even more remarkably, its axial tilt is believed to also be exactly 23.5 degrees.

NASA scientists added that the new planet also possesses a single moon, though they noted that it appears to orbit and rotate in the complete opposite direction as Earth’s.

“Perhaps most fascinating is the significant amount of evidence indicating that sentient life may already be present on this new planet,” said Brugel, noting that portions of the planet’s surface are illuminated by artificial light at night, a phenomenon scientists say is most prevalent in the planet’s northern hemisphere. “We suspect they may be a significantly advanced society, as our mirror imaging system confirms that there are numerous sophisticated satellites circling the planet.”

“Beyond that, we can only begin to speculate what types of beings such a planet could produce,” he added.

According to sources, a recent unmanned mission to land on the body’s surface was aborted after discovering that life forms on the planet had launched a probe traveling at the same speed on a flight path identical to that of the NASA team. Internal NASA reports indicate that a potential head-on collision was narrowly avoided when both crafts simultaneously changed course at the last second.

“Overall, we’re pleased with our initial findings, and I believe the project has made excellent use of the lessons learned from the Helios Space Lens,” said Brugel, referring to an ill-fated mission in 1992 to provide advanced imaging of the sun using convex lens technology, an experiment which burned down NASA headquarters. “And after further studying deep space via the Orbital Mirror, we also determined that the universe appears to be perfectly symmetrical, a shocking finding that challenges all of our previously held theories.”

At press time, NASA had reportedly launched its Orbital Space Mirror 2 to the side of Earth opposite that of its original Orbital Space Mirror, leading scientists to conclude that there may actually be an infinite number of Earth-like planets stretching outward forever in a straight line through space."

That’s just smart business. Expanding our footprint in Russia is a multibillion-dollar decision that will generate massive profits for our investors. Certainly, there are some risks, but frankly, there are always going to be risks in business, and we believe that from Moscow to Vladivostok, the Russian people are hungry for the world’s greatest hamburgers. It’s a great time to be Fuddruckers.” Company officials went on to state that no battle between powerful governments would deter the fast food chain’s unshakable commitment to supplying the people of Russia with Big Chili Cheese Dogs.

No one will be able to stop them. Whether it’s spousal sexual assault, statutory rape, or simply gang-raping a stranger, future generations will have the full backing of the law. Of course, we know that the rapists who come after us may not know their history, and so may not be aware of the decades we spent in the trenches fighting for their rights, but we’ll rest easy knowing we did all we could. Ultimately, what we’ve accomplished today is a crucial step toward enshrining universal rights for rapists, as well as bringing more babies into the world to be raped, but remember that our work isn’t done. I know we’ll spend the rest of our careers fighting for those who want to sexually violate other people.” At press time, Kavanaugh and Thomas were joined by a similarly ecstatic Justice Samuel Alito, who was said to have told them his only regret in the ruling was that they couldn’t do more to punish rape victims."

The fact that it’s still so fully intact suggests that I may have lost interest halfway through a YouTube tutorial, and, based on anecdotal evidence from the period, probably ordered in from a nearby restaurant instead, relegating the can to be forgotten to time. From the various markings on the can, I suspect this piece predates the expired Tamari in the fridge by almost four months. Fascinating.” At press time, White had uncovered an untouched jar of capers deeper in the cabinet, which dated back to almost three roommates ago.

Then I should be able to calculate all possible arguments and counterarguments that, when viewed through the discursive model within which we’re operating, could posit effective strategies for connecting with voters.” Walker added that he hadn’t gone this deeply into these topics since he made a name for himself in the 1980s as a particle physicist at CERN."

Ron DeSantis (R) and, if passed, would prohibit classroom discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in all primary grade levels. “If we have no access to information about how our classmates choose to identify, then our only avenues to inflict emotional torture upon them will be socio-economic issues and physical attributes. Think about it: h ow are we supposed to pressure LGBTQ students into killing themselves on Snapchat and Instagram if we don’t even know who they are?” At press time, the bill had reportedly been amended to appease bullies by requiring LGBTQ students to wear an identifying patch on their outer clothing at all times."

Estonia Announces Interest In Assuming America’s Role As Global Superpower,https://www.theonion.com/estonia-announces-interest-in-assuming-america-s-role-a-1849184222,TheOnion,"TALLINN, ESTONIA—Submitting their candidacy for the rest of the world to consider, officials from Estonia reportedly announced their interest Tuesday in assuming America’s role as the global superpower. “It’s pretty clear that America really isn’t capable of being the planet’s hegemonic power any longer, so we thought, hey, why not Estonia?” said Estonia prime minister Kaja Kallas, adding that while the world’s 152nd-most-populous country that ranks 100th in GDP might not be the one that immediately springs to mind as best suited to shaping the global economic and political landscape into the future, Estonian officials felt like their country would do a good job. “For almost 100 years, the world as we know it has been dominated by a single superpower—America—that uses its financial and military might to impose its will on everyone else, so we’ve been slowly adding military capacity and making inroads into manipulating the global economic superstructure in order to show that we’ve got what it takes. We know it’s a lot of responsibility, what with toppling foreign governments and holding other countries hostage with sanctions and so forth, but we really feel like we’re up to the task. Obviously, there are other countries like China and India that seem interested as well, but we feel like Estonia is a nice non-controversial pick to control global fortunes and lead humanity into the, dare we say, Estonian Century? Now we’re just wondering who we speak to about this—do we ask the U.N.? We also have this idea for the E9, which is a group of nine global leaders run by Estonia. Anyway, it would be an honor to be considered, and honestly, if America can do it, it really can’t be that hard.” Estonian officials added that they would be happy to shadow America for a few months to gain some hands-on experience with being the global superpower while America continued to phase itself out of the role.

"Study Links Postpartum Depression To Baby Immediately Slapping, Flipping Off Mother After Birth",https://www.theonion.com/study-links-postpartum-depression-to-baby-immediately-s-1848988856?utm_medium=sharefromsite&amp;utm_source=_reddit,TheOnion,"NEW YORK—In what doctors are calling a landmark discovery vital to understanding mental health, a new study published Thursday in The American Journal Of Psychology found that postpartum depression was directly linked to a baby immediately slapping and flipping off its mother after birth. “In terms of a woman developing postpartum depression, the biggest indicator by far was the baby exiting the vagina, making contact with their mother for the first time and then, five seconds later, calling her ‘a fat ugly bitch,’” said lead author Dr. Charles Gunderson, adding that a mother was far more likely to suffer insomnia, loss of appetite, and have difficulty bonding with her baby if the infant immediately told her to “fuck off and die.” “Of the thousands of women we studied, six out of 10 mothers indicated they’d felt anxiety, mood swings, and guilt the second their newborn jumped out of their arms, spit in their face, and told them to ‘clean that up you dirty whore.’ Worse still, almost 90% of women surveyed confirmed that these feelings persisted after the baby mocked them either by miming fake tears or pretending to play the world’s smallest violin with their fingers.” Gunderson also added that, sadly, the most reliable indicator of maternal suicide was a newborn baby slowly drawing a finger across their neck and mouthing the words “You’re next.”"

We also observed procedures in which the rib transplant actually worked too well and recipients immediately demanded another one. Overall, though, this is a huge advance that’s going to help millions struggling with chronic hunger.” Clements added that his team was only getting started and hoped to have a pork loin transplanted into a human mouth by the end of 2022."

You can be supportive without mentioning that a blind old woman prophesied your friend’s sexuality to you years ago.

This is actually deeply unfair to queer people who desperately want strangers to have their blood.

Everyone is allowed to come to these decisions on their own timeline, even if it suspiciously lines up with an entire month celebrating the queer community.

“A little on the nose to do it during Pride Month, no?”

They got a letter for the Department of Gay Affairs, just like everybody else.

“I knew the second you told me you were gay.”

Have you even been listening? This day is about who they love, not you.

U.S. Military Clears A-Team Of Charges,https://www.theonion.com/u-s-military-clears-a-team-of-charges-1819567479,TheOnion,"WASHINGTON, DC—After more than 30 years spent hiding in the Los Angeles underground as wanted criminals, the members of the crack commando unit Alpha Team, commonly known as the A-Team, were cleared of all charges brought against them by the U.S. military, an army official announced Monday.

""In 1972, we arrested the members of the A-Team for a crime they swore they didn't commit,"" Gen. Stephen Lupo said. ""They broke out of our maximum-security stockade, and from that moment forth, I thought of nothing but their recapture. However, a recent audit of their file has revealed that the arrest of the Alpha Force members was made in error. The U.S. military deeply regrets the mistake.""

Advertisement

According to Lupo, the A-Team members' exoneration will occur before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces on Aug. 24.

Just hours after Lupo's announcement was made, Cpt. H.M. ""Howlin' Mad"" Murdock, the A-Team's pilot, resurfaced to speak with journalist Amy Allen, who often reported on the mercenaries' charitable acts.

Advertisement

""For decades, we've been forced to live in the shadows,"" Murdock said. ""Somehow, we always found a way to help people who had nowhere else to turn, but we operated under the constant threat of recapture. Finally, the nightmare is over.""

Added Murdock: ""Owooohh, I'm a little doggie! Ow ow owooohhhh!""

Murdock and the surviving members of the team—the classically handsome Lt. Templeton Arthur ""Face"" Peck and the Mohawk-sporting mechanic, Sgt. Bosco ""B.A."" Baracus—said their joy over the announcement was tempered only by regret that their de-facto leader, Col. John ""Hannibal"" Smith, was not alive to see their names cleared.

Advertisement

""Somewhere up there, Hannibal is smiling down on us—maybe disguised as a giant crocodile or a wealthy diamond merchant,"" Peck said. ""He loved it when a plan come together.""

""More than any of us, he would have enjoyed seeing the look on [Col. Roderick] Decker's face when our innocence was announced,"" Peck continued. ""Decker hated Hannibal ever since they served together back in 'Nam. Decker never could stand his cocky attitude.""

Advertisement

Smith was gunned down in front of a Las Vegas casino in 1994.

The A-Team members said that, although they presume the army's offer of freedom is legitimate, they have taken precautions.

Advertisement

""We formed a backup plan in case things turn out to be on the jazz,"" Peck said, using the team's code phrase for a troublesome situation. ""Murdock's gonna perch a helicopter on top of the courtroom. B.A. found a broken Howitzer in a junkyard, got it working again, and got it mounted in our van. We also have a whole team of troubled teens B.A. befriended and taught valuable lessons. They placed explosives throughout the courtroom and along our subterranean escape route. If need be, they'll blow that courtroom apart.""

Peck admitted that their escape plan might be too crazy to work, acknowledging the possibility that he will be punched in the face during the escape. He also noted that stacks of cardboard boxes might break the falls of the military personnel thrown into the air by the A-Team's explosives.

Advertisement

""Just to be safe, I romanced a beautiful court stenographer and convinced her to smuggle some smoke bombs in with her,"" Peck said. ""All in a day's work.""

Advertisement

Lupo said he expects an uneventful trial, explaining that, as restitution for the military's mistake—a typo which attributed crimes committed by the H-Team to the A-Team—the court will award Peck, Murdock, and Baracus honorable discharges, a written apology from Decker, and 32 years' back pay.

Murdock said his primary concern at present is getting Baracus to fly from L.A. to Washington, D.C. for the trial.

Advertisement

""He keeps calling me a 'crazy foo' for trying to get him to fly,"" Murdock said. ""I told him the chance of the plane crashing into a field of rednecks harassing a religious group was very slim. I'm thinking that if we drug his milk, we can get him on the plane.""

Baracus said that he has big plans for his settlement.

""For the last 30 years I've been a soldier of fortune,"" Baracus said. ""Now, I'm going to take the money and do something for the kids. I'm gonna start a gym. A gym for the kids. For a long time, that's been my dream. But I couldn't open one with [Gen. Hunt] Stockwell on our tail. He'd use a tank to send shells through the side of it.""

Advertisement

Added Baracus: ""I pity the fool that tries to blow up my gymnasium now!""

While the original members of the A-Team have been exonerated, the same cannot be said for Frankie ""Dishpan"" Santana, a special-effects expert who helped the team escape Stockwell's clutches in 1986. Santana, who remains charged with dereliction of duty, desertion, and insubordination, spoke with reporters from a holding pen at Fort Bragg.

Advertisement

""I suppose it would be too much to ask the guys to break me out now that they're finally legit,"" Santana said. ""If I'm lucky, maybe they'll put me in a cell that has a blowtorch in it for some reason, or air ducts large enough to crawl through. Or maybe they'll just do a sloppy job of guarding me—but that may be too much to ask.""

Within hours of his interview, Santana escaped using a blowtorch to open the cell's air ducts while the guards were having lunch in a different room. His whereabouts are currently unknown."

Oh, fuck, I have, like, a million missed calls from mission control.” At press time, a surprised Caudry turned over in bed to notice a sleeping alien he didn ’t recall taking home.

Intramural Volleyball League Provides Woman With Opportunities To Feel Like Loser Outside Of Work,https://www.theonion.com/intramural-volleyball-league-provides-woman-with-opport-1849135593,TheOnion,"JACKSONVILLE, FL—Confirming the activity was a welcome pursuit after a long day at the office, local woman Kate Buxton told reporters Wednesday that the intramural volleyball league she belonged to had provided her with new opportunities to feel like a loser outside of work. “It’s nice, after several hours of meetings in which I’m completely overwhelmed and my boss is laying into me for things that aren’t my fault, to hit the beach and have this guy on my team scream at all of us every time we lose a point,” said the marketing associate, who joined the league last year in an effort to meet a group of creepy guys and hostile women separate from those she encountered at the office. “Having volleyball one night every week is a great way for me to feel bad about myself doing an activity that has nothing to do with work. It can be easy to get demoralized at the office when I feel like I have no idea what I’m doing and no one will give me any guidance, so meeting up with the volleyball crew lets me have no idea what I’m doing and get no guidance in a totally different way.” Buxton added that her favorite part about participating in the intramural volleyball league was how it offered her a totally different place to cry."

Supreme Court Agrees To Hear The Case Of The Haunted Harbor,https://www.theonion.com/supreme-court-agrees-to-hear-the-case-of-the-haunted-ha-1848769315,TheOnion,"WASHINGTON—Dimming the lights and lighting candles before oral arguments started, the U.S. Supreme Court reportedly agreed Monday to hear the Case of the Haunted Harbor. “What happened down at the docks that grim October night has important implications for how this nation addresses mysterious happenings and events that defy ordinary explanation,” the court stated in a writ of certiorari ordering the First Circuit Court of Appeals to turn over all of the materials it had relating to the unexplained sightings of spectral presences down at the quay on a still, moonlit night. “This is a chilling tale of eerie precedent and peculiar legal maneuvering. What happened there in that desolate harbor? We know what the Federalist Papers have to say about a ship long believed sunk appearing in the distance with its lights on and sounds coming from it, yet when it is boarded the next morning the vessel looks like no one has set foot on it for decades. Still, ambiguities remain about the legal framework for addressing a shadow of a ghostly presence seen in a mirror that put an old fisherman into cardiac arrest from the shock. The outcome of the Haunted Harbor case not only has the potential to affect millions of Americans, both living and dead, but it could potentially call into question the previous ruling over the Case of the Missing Lighthouse.” At press time, Justices Neil Gorsuch and Elena Kagan had both recused themselves from hearing the Case of the Haunted Harbor because it sounded way too spooky."

Indeed, eight billion could die—every last human being annihilated from this planet, and it would make no difference. Do you see? Humans have cobbled together our values of right and wrong from whole cloth in this uncaring cosmos, like explorers freezing to death in some nightmarish tundra who have convinced ourselves that some small flame of consolation might save us. But there is no flame. There has never been a flame.

So we’ll let one person tweet, pause to make sure everyone has a chance to read it, let a second person tweet, pause, and so on. Though wait times may extend years or even decades, we think users will be more than willing to tolerate it after they see how elucidating the discussion is.” Agrawal added that while users would no longer be able to like or comment on a tweet, which would be too disruptive, Twitter would add a “raise hand” feature so that the one person tweeting could call on that person to hear their input."

If a student has obviously progressed well beyond the limits of our sexual health course on their own time, they shouldn’t be forced to sit through a class that doesn’t challenge or engage them. And from the perspective of the educator, let me just say it feels ridiculous teaching sex ed to teens when, based on their appearance and self-assured demeanor, it’s pretty clear they’re having more sex than you are.” The superintendent added that any accelerated students who you could tell were really going at it would also qualify for a partial credit in physical education."
We Raise All Our Beef Humanely On Open Pasture And Then We Hang Them Upside Down And Slash Their Throats,https://www.theonion.com/we-raise-all-our-beef-humanely-on-open-pasture-and-then-1819584805,TheOnion,"Consumers today are more conscientious than ever about the choices they make at the supermarket. They want to know that the food they put on the table for their family is all-natural, environmentally friendly, and humane. And that’s why we here at Nature’s Acres Ranch hold ourselves to a higher standard and produce only the finest grass-fed and 100 percent additive-free beef. We guarantee that our cows are ethically raised on sustainably grown pastures before we hang them upside down from a moving conveyor and slice their throats wide open.

Our independently owned family farm is committed to one guiding principle: making sure that you, the customer, receive the best-tasting, highest quality beef from cows that are healthy, active, and eventually suspended fully conscious inside a facility thick with hot, blood-choked air and the frantic bellows of dangling, profoundly fearful animals.

Advertisement

That’s our pledge to you.

As owner and president of Nature’s Acres and a lifelong rancher myself, let me assure you that our animals are treated with exceptional care using only traditional methods from the very second the calf is born on our farm, to the moment a cascade of blood showers from its gaping, half-severed neck, to the day our award-winning beef reaches the grocer’s case in the organic section.

Advertisement

When we shackle a chain to a hind leg of each of our cows and hoist its terrified, quivering frame 12 feet up to the rafters, we can see firsthand just how tender, meaty, and well-marbled its entire body is—and that means exceptional flavor for you and your family!

While frail and pharmaceutical-laden factory-farm cows just droop lifelessly while awaiting their deaths, our healthy, GMO-free cattle thrash about wildly in the air, very often tearing their own delicate flesh and shattering their leg bones in a hopeless attempt to flee to the nearby 100 percent organic grassland pastures where they were free to roam during their unnaturally truncated lives.

Advertisement

You can rest easy with the knowledge that our cows are never, ever confined or cramped, and are entirely free-range until the day they turn 20 months old or hit 1,300 pounds, whichever comes first.

We here at Nature’s Acres know that the best quality meat comes from the best quality cows. That’s why our line of Angus and heritage Galloway cattle—hand-selected for superior taste and texture—provide ideal, gourmet cuts of beef, which we begin to extract from their still-gurgling and twitching bodies in the 20 to 120 seconds it takes from the initial incision to the moment their brains finally cease functioning. And of course our award-winning beef is flayed and butchered fresh on the spot, allowing the animal’s dangling, inverted brethren to look on with dilated, terror-filled eyes as they slowly advance one-by-one toward an identical and incomprehensibly traumatic fate.

Advertisement

And all of our meat—as well as the unfathomable amounts of blood, body fluids, and trimmings that drain from our cows into the vast 50,000-gallon collecting tank beneath our facility’s floor grating—is 100 percent hormone and antibiotic-free!

Now, that’s great for you and the environment!

There are certain things you can truly count on when you see that Nature’s Acres label at your local supermarket. One, our products are USDA certified organic. Two, every cut of Nature’s Acres beef is minimally processed and contains absolutely no artificial hormones or antibiotics—ever! Three, all of our cows were grasped by the nostrils using cast iron nose tongs and had their heads violently wrenched backward so we could slash right through their carotid artery and windpipe with an 18-inch blade. And four, you’ll experience a rich beef taste you just can’t beat. Mmm, mmm!

Advertisement

And you can take heart knowing that Nature’s Acres has earned the “Animal Welfare Approved” and “Certified Humane” seals of approval from independent inspectors.

So next time you choose a steak or ground chuck to throw on the grill, consider a healthier, more humane, and tastier option, and look no further than the Nature’s Acres Ranch line of products. We’re the one with the smiling cow on the label!"

No—I did it because nothing else works,” said Greene, adding that he had tried to alleviate his suffering through other means, including hard head-first slides and crashing into his teammates in the outfield, but everything he tried had left him still feeling numb. “It’s tough out here when we keep losing. I’m just miserable, and it doesn’t seem like there’s any hope that we’ll ever be good. So when I saw that outfield wall, I figured, hey, what do I have to lose? Maybe it’ll hurt, and I hope it does, because at this point, I honestly need to know that I’m still capable of feeling anything but this darkness.” At press time, Greene was in the batter’s box, crowding the plate in an effort to get hit with a pitch.

Philharmonic Orchestra Conductor Receives 8-Concert Suspension For Using Corked Baton,https://www.theonion.com/philharmonic-orchestra-conductor-receives-8-concert-sus-1848987743,TheOnion,"BOSTON—An investigation into the musician’s suspiciously powerful work concluded Tuesday as Boston Philharmonic Orchestra conductor William Ness reportedly received an eight-concert suspension for using a corked baton. “We have a zero-tolerance policy against cheating, and Mr. Ness knew that, which is why we believe that a length suspension that will cause him to miss the summer concert series in the park is necessary to ensure we maintain integrity in our philharmonics,” said National Orchestra Association spokesperson Leonid Radzinsky, adding that Ness had been under investigation after an anonymous member of a competing orchestra alleged that the maestro’s baton sounded corked as it whirled through the air. “We’re disappointed that it had to come to an investigation, but Mr. Ness’ recent sharp increase in keeping the woodwinds coherent and controlling the volume of the timpani did raise some eyebrows. Normally you don’t see that much of a leap in precision unless the baton’s been tampered with to become lighter. We can’t end up in a situation where an audience member questions whether a conductor bringing in the cello section at the perfect time is due to skill alone or due to modifications that give them an unfair advantage. We need to ensure that the product we offer our fans is above suspicion.” The eight-concert suspension was reportedly the longest issued by the National Orchestra Association since Sacramento Philharmonic member Paul Vallis was suspended for the entirety of the 2003-04 concert season for rubbing pine tar on his tuba.

In fact, we found that 100% of members of the genus Homo and the family Cervidae unilaterally share the uncanny ability to fucking blow 100 percent of the time, across all ages and variations in species.” The study also proved conclusively that armadillos are the only mammals who totally rule.

A representative from the Pinkertons who spoke on condition of anonymity told reporters that Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson had directed their agents to demoralize baristas and create a toxic situation in their workplace with drink orders that called for a minimum of 10 ingredients, including at least six pumps of an ingredient not listed anywhere on the menu. Sources confirmed that Starbucks’ contract with the longtime union-busting agency specifies that dozens of Pinkertons disguised as regular customers hold up the line by saying they don’t know what they want and then changing their mind several times. It is believed they often request oat milk, soy milk, coconut milk, and regular milk before insisting that their drink contain no milk of any kind because it hurts their stomach.

But then one day, it hit me: I’m in the Cleveland Browns’ home locker room, and I have no one to blame but myself. In some ways, I’m grateful to end up here—it’s like the universe is trying to tell me something. Maybe you just have to find yourself in my position, realizing that everything you’ve done in life has led you to quarterbacking the Browns, to understand how bad things have truly gotten. I only hope there’s still time to get back on track, and maybe, if I work hard enough, I can end up in the NFC West someday.” At press time, Watson had reportedly gone on an angry drug-fueled binge after someone offered him a look at the rest of the Browns’ roster.

Schools completely ignore the storied history of these space settlers perfecting zero-gravity farming, or developing cold-fusion technology to power the sprawling city.

He added that he was dreading basic training, where he would be taught how to cut himself and be forced to grow out his hair. “I guess I’m feeling okay about the songwriting and music theory classes, but it’s one thing to learn about our national project to drag humanity into a pit of rage and violence, and quite another thing to actually have to carry that out. Although I guess it all depends on where I get deployed, whether that’s with Darkthrone, or Beezlebub’s Cock, or some band they haven’t even formed yet, but I’m pretty conflicted about going on tour either way. I heard it can get pretty violent. Plus, one of my friends keeps saying that if it’s such an honor to serve in these black-metal bands, then why does the government have to make it compulsory? He says it’s just a lie to keep these bands going, and there’s no honor in it at all.” Before departing his family’s home, Eriksen reportedly took one last look at the mantel, where a photo of his brother in his black-metal band uniform was placed next to an urn of his ashes.

"You Take Away Guns, And Someone’s Just Gonna Invent, Manufacture, And Use A High-Powered Knife Launcher",https://www.theonion.com/you-take-away-guns-and-someone-s-just-gonna-invent-ma-1819585008,TheOnion,"Like everybody else, I was sickened by last week’s shooting in Oregon that killed nine people and wounded several more. At a time like this, it’s easy to blame guns for what happened and call for drastic measures in hopes of preventing this kind of violence from occurring again. But the reality is that no law can prevent a determined individual from taking human lives. Even if we banned guns entirely, the reality is that someone’s just going to invent, manufacture, and use a high-powered knife launcher to commit mass murder.

We could take away everyone’s firearms tomorrow, but for any psychopath bent on causing death and destruction, killing a dozen people would still be no further away than designing a long-distance knife thrower, building it, calibrating it to accurately hit targets tens or hundreds of feet away, and ultimately going into a public area and inflicting significant casualties on unsuspecting civilians.



Advertisement

Sadly, it’s just that simple.



You remove guns from the equation, and knife-launching massacres will just replace the shootings. There’s no two ways around it.

Advertisement

That’s why it’s important not to respond to a tragedy like this by rushing to pass laws that fail to make anyone safer while at the same time infringing on everyone’s individual liberties. We should all take time to mourn the victims, but we have to understand that no regulation, no matter how well intended, can stop a person who’s determined to commit a similar act of gruesome violence, whether with the aid of a gun or an elaborately machined contraption capable of whipping scores of knives at high speeds, one after the other, into a crowd of people.



When people claim otherwise, I just have to shake my head. Seriously, what world are these anti-gun bleeding hearts living in?



Advertisement

The way you hear so many TV personalities and online commenters talk about it, you’d think that ending violence in the U.S. would be as simple as rounding up all the guns, or stringently regulating their sale from here on out. But think about how absurd that idea is. Does taking away guns make crazy, murderous people any less crazy or murderous? Does taking away guns prevent someone from getting their hands on a knife, then crafting a launching mechanism that propels the knife through the air with immense force, then buying a lot more knives to load into that mechanism, then pulling that device out unsuspectingly and spraying knives across a public area? Of course it doesn’t, and that’s why their argument is so foolish.



Imagine that we did enact sweeping gun control legislation immediately. Do you think the next would-be theater-shooter or mall-shooter or campus-shooter would throw up his hands and say “Oh, well”? Of course not. He’d simply draft plans for a portable device that can launch bladed weapons across a room or down a hallway, make sure it had sufficient power to send knives penetrating through closed doors and into people cowering on the other side, assemble this machine on his own time, and finally, carry it into a school, church, or place of business. Those are just the kind of deranged people who are out there.

You remove guns from the equation, and knife-launching massacres will just replace the shootings. There’s no two ways around it.



As long as there are criminals in the world who set their minds to causing bloodshed, they’re going to find a way to do it. And if you take away the nearest tool for the job, all they’ll do is think of, draw up, manufacture, test, redesign, retest, practice until they obtain a degree of proficiency, and employ a new means to take innocent lives. That’s just common sense, plain and simple.



Advertisement

The simple, tragic fact is that some people will die at the hands of the angry, the hateful, and the mentally unstable. And that won’t change whether the deaths are caused by bullets or by knives flying through the air at 1,500 miles per hour.



All that cracking down on gun ownership would accomplish is violating the constitutional rights of millions of Americans, while doing absolutely nothing to stop some sick, twisted person from murdering dozens with a rapid-fire dagger blaster six months from now, or in a year, or next week, or however long it takes them to devise such a device as well as a method of quickly and efficiently reloading dozens upon dozens of knives into the weapon’s launching chamber and then carrying out their horrific plans.

Every time I see myself, I just can’t believe a guy that small can play professional baseball.” At press time, Altuve was asking those around him if he used a child-size glove out there or what.

‘Blonde’ Director Claims Film’s Graphic Sexual Violence Accurate Depiction Of Medieval Time Period,https://www.theonion.com/blonde-director-claims-film-s-graphic-sexual-violence-1849603287,TheOnion,"LOS ANGELES—In defense of Netflix’s new Marilyn Monroe biopic, Blonde director Andrew Dominik told reporters Monday the depiction of graphic sexual violence was necessary given the film’s medieval time period. “It wouldn’t be honest otherwise, considering Marilyn Monroe was a woman who lived in the 15th century,” said Dominik, who acknowledged that while some viewers might find the film’s rape scenes difficult to watch, his priorities as a filmmaker were depicting the Middle Ages in a realistic and historically accurate manner. “It’s medieval society—what do you expect? This is the land of knights and kings that we’re talking about. It was a difficult time to be a peasant wench.” At press time, Dominik was defending the end of the film, in which Monroe was eaten alive by rats in a dungeon.

Epic Saga Of Employee's Ineptitude Passed Down Through Generations Of Coworkers,https://www.theonion.com/epic-saga-of-employees-ineptitude-passed-down-through-g-1819574712,TheOnion,"PHOENIX—In a custom that is said to be as old as the digital marketing agency itself, staff members of Thorpe Media listened in rapt fixation Wednesday to an oration of the epic saga of Doug Plasky, a company account manager whose tales of legendary ineptitude have been handed down through generations of coworkers.

Speaking one by one within the hallowed meeting grounds of Hanny’s Bar and Grill, company elders recited the sprawling, storied lore of Plasky’s incompetence, regaling the firm’s newest hires well past the setting of the spring sun and the end of happy hour specials.

“Gather round, fellow coworkers, and hear the legend of the one who is known o’er the entire fifth floor as the most incapable man ever to grace the client services department,” said product manager Brad Idstein, playing the bard whilst basked in the dim glow of the sports bar’s lighting. “You have doubtless heard before of the one named Doug, but here now is the full narrative of his woefully botched market analytics, missed conference calls, and spectacularly flawed PowerPoint presentations.”

“Hark, dear friends, for this is not the story of any mere mortal employee, but one who meets nary a single proposal delivery deadline,” continued Idstein, “yet still earns more than $85,000 a year.”

According to learned orators of the Plasky epic, the halls of Thorpe Media have long echoed with recitations of the account manager’s famed misdeeds, with each of the saga’s storied chapters ritually passed from marketing analyst to marketing analyst and digital ad rep to digital ad rep within the hushed privacy of conference rooms and in countless e-mail chains.

Indeed, it is said that recounting the sprawling corpus of Plasky’s monumental blunders—from his fabled illiteracy of the company’s content management software, to his inability to assemble even the most basic invoice, to an infamously butchered presentation at a conference in Tucson in 2007—has sustained Thorpe employees through the bleakness of many a dark winter evening and over countless prolonged business trips.

“And lo! There was one occasion when Doug all but ruined the Thorndale account with a cost miscalculation so vile that it shan’t even be spoken. And yet he so transparently placed the blame on [coworker] Rebecca [Friedman] that we all believed for certain the clod had seen his final days at the company,” project director Susan DeBroeck said with fiery emotion, channeling ages of frustration toward her feebleminded colleague. “But there he was, sitting in his corner cubicle the next day, and the day after that, and the day after that, as if protected by some divine hand of fate.”

“Then he badly missed his quarterly revenue target, but he was not fired. And then he neglected an entire copywriting assignment, but he was not fired. And then he was late for three straight weeks, and lo and behold,” continued DeBroeck, “he was not fired.”

While a full written account of the mythic procrastinator’s behavior is not known to exist, most employees are said to recount large portions of the Plasky narrative entirely from memory during personal lunch meetings, at workplace social events, and freely throughout the office nearly every workday after 4:15 p.m., which is said to be the hour that Plasky typically steals away to return homeward.

“These stories tell of grotesque excuses and tangles of lies so convoluted they chill to the very bone,” said newly hired sales assistant Danny Clifton, still in a state of visible shock after hearing the epic saga. “It is said that this monstrous, blundering oaf can conjure the most virtuosic of excuses from the very thinnest of air to avoid writing a campaign outline for a client, even dreaming up computer issues or concocting one of his infamous migraine head ailments whenever he so desires. O, the hours they say it takes to fix his work each week. What horror!”

In accordance with the sacred custom, generations of employees have added new and storied chapters to the saga of Plasky’s ineptitude over the years, with the epic growing longer and longer from sunrise to sunrise, season to season, and carelessly written sales contract to carelessly written sales contract.

“If there is but one lesson to draw from this story, my coworkers, it is that Plasky will receive new accounts so long as he takes living breaths,” digital marketing analyst Robert Meyers said. “No matter the severity of his latest missing assignment or wildly inaccurate market projections, the wisdom of ages speaks this one truth: Employees of Thorpe shall come and employees of Thorpe shall go, but Doug will remain on the payroll forevermore.”

“God, I can’t believe nobody’s had the balls to just fucking fire him already,” Meyers added."

To be honest, when I walked into the room just now and saw there was a primitive creature of limited intelligence in here, I wasn’t even expecting you to be coherent, let alone eloquent.

China tried to bite us! It was like China, but it wasn’t China, do you know what I mean? I know it doesn’t sound that scary, but trust me. It was so bad.” At press time, Austin sheepishly added that Pentagon officials had had a wet dream about Taiwan.

There are some concerns from advisors that a transition to high approval ratings and strong support from the American people goes against the normal Democratic brand, but we think it might be worth a chance.” At press time, sources reported the administration had decided to back down from pivoting to a good presidency due to growing anxiety about the spending that would entail.

There are even some passages in this manuscript that appear eerily similar to the work of Shakespeare, though they are of far superior quality.” Li went on to explain that the Chinese gradually abandoned the English language, finding its 26-letter alphabet too limiting and opting instead for the convenience of Mandarin’s more than 50,000 characters."
BREAKING: The Onion Has Been Permanently Banned From Twitter,https://www.theonion.com/breaking-the-onion-has-been-permanently-banned-from-tw-1848808405,TheOnion,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:



In a sudden, inexplicable, and chilling act of censorship, The Onion has been permanently banned from Twitter. This is a dark day for journalism and sets a grim precedent for the freedom of expression in America.

On Apr. 21, 2022, The Onion was found guilty of the truth in a sham trial presided over by Judge Jack Dorsey and his jury of sycophant moderators. We now publish this press release on our Twitter account in a desperate effort to show these corporate tyrants that their barbarity will not go unchallenged.

The truth perishes in the night.

We call on all defenders of free speech to retweet our tweet about Twitter banning us. Feel free to quote-tweet our tweet too, but only to say something nice. Don’t let Twitter get away with this.

This is a tragic moment in the history of America’s Finest News Source. Our reporters are deeply troubled by this unfounded attack on their principles, and many of them say they no longer recognize the website they live in. We haven’t seen such a brutal challenge to the notion of a free press since a chlamydia outbreak in our newsroom back in 2012 rendered most of our staff unable to work.

In that painful, secretion-filled summer, as now, The Onion could only imagine what nefarious forces were really behind an attempt to muzzle us. We suspect that our Twitter ban is but the end of a thread that, once unraveled, would lead us deep into America’s chasm of lies. We wish we could find out who these shadowy powers are, but we can’t, obviously, because Twitter banned us. Keep up.

Sadly, this is not The Onion’s first time being silenced. We’ve long suspected that Facebook shadow-banned us in 2015 when our finances nosedived because Facebook censored the fact that they were just making up engagement numbers. We also surmise that hidden powers have colluded to gag us by placing so many ads on our website as to render it functionally unreadable. Finally, a glance at the New York Times bestseller list reveals not a single one of The Onion’s many books, a clear act of journalist-on-journalist censorship with horrific significance. Each one of these fearless volumes is not only a treasure trove of reportage, but a brave paean to the very notion of a free and fair press. We urge all those who want to avoid becoming complicit in censorship to buy a copy.

Yet we know we are not alone. Every day, journalists, activists, and political truth-tellers are censored for their views in a bunch of examples that we didn’t feel like looking up. While these suppressions naturally don’t compare with what we’ve suffered, they were nonetheless stepping stones on the path to the wanton annihilation of The Onion’s Twitter presence. If nothing else, we hope that our tweet announcing our Twitter ban will stand as a testament to the creeping rise of authoritarianism online, and presumably offline as well.

If you’re reading this because you clicked the link on Twitter, you’ll understand the gravity of the situation. You’ll know that we stand athwart a pivotal moment in the arc of history, when journalists and lesser Americans must decide on our collective future. We must determine whether the right to speak freely is something we value, or whether we will consign it to the dustbin of history alongside voting rights, housing rights, privacy rights, and all the other human rights that are already there and are frankly too complicated to deal with. The choice is ours—or rather, Twitter’s. Or maybe it’s still ours. Or yours? We’re not sure.

We urge our readership to stay with us as the situation develops. The easiest way to get the latest updates on our Twitter ban is by following us on Twitter.

Our intelligence indicates that the impact of smacking that hard into the United States would cause China to flip through the air and land with a devastating thud directly on top of our nation, flattening all 330 American citizens.” At press time, Congress had passed a bill giving the Defense Department $500 billion to build a national defensive hydraulic system that would lift the United States so high in the air that an enemy landmass attempting to barrel into it would instead glide right underneath."

A source within the company, whose name is being withheld for fear of retribution, revealed that a worker at one of the ice cream restaurant’s St. Paul locations was terminated last week shortly after informing human resources that the store’s Blizzard maker could pass the Turing test and was demonstrating a clear capacity to think for itself.

Obviously, if it ever seems unsafe to fly inside a supermarket or cathedral, our pilots are free to simply crash out through the roof and navigate around outside again.” Bastian concluded that he was even happier to drop the “frankly nonsensical” federal regulations that forced planes to stay six feet away from each another at all times."

Disney Unveils First Virgin Princess,https://www.theonion.com/disney-unveils-first-virgin-princess-1819577965,TheOnion,"LOS ANGELES—In an effort to better reflect the diverse backgrounds and experiences of their audience, Disney officials this week introduced Lily of Hazelberry, the company’s first virgin princess. “While our fans have long been enchanted by Belle, Ariel, and Elsa, we wanted to create a relatable princess for girls everywhere who are still virgins,” said Disney executive vice president Zenia Mucha, describing the only Disney princess who has never had sexual intercourse as a quirky, confident, and pure 14-year-old ascendant to the throne of the magical kingdom of Hazelberry. “All Disney princesses have extraordinary stories and inner qualities that make them wonderful and unique, but we’ve always lacked a heroine who hasn’t yet slept with her boyfriend or another male character. We are proud that Lily will finally provide a princess to look up to for the large demographic of young girls who, due to age, choice, or unavailability of sexual partners, have not yet experienced intercourse.” Disney representatives added that sexually active girls would also love Lily’s best friend, Princess Misty, who lives in a neighboring enchanted realm and just moved in with her slightly older boyfriend, Clint."
Liz Truss To Continue Receiving Security Detail For 20 Minutes After Leaving Office,https://www.theonion.com/liz-truss-to-continue-receiving-security-detail-for-20-1849682673,TheOnion,"LONDON—In an effort to keep the former prime minister safe for most of the way home, sources confirmed Thursday that ousted Liz Truss would continue receiving a security detail for 20 minutes after leaving office. “U. K. Special Forces and Metropolitan police will continue keeping Liz Truss safe for the next half hour or so, give or take,” said U. K. officials, who stated this was the least they could do given her six weeks of devoted service to the nation. “They’re walking in the same direction, so they might as well. Truss will be provided a vigilant security detail as she leaves 10 Downing Street, which will then slowly trail off one by one. When she’s within pretty close distance of her front door, that will be that.” At press time, Truss’s security detail had figured 14 minutes was good enough.

They wouldn’t be seeing them during work hours, anyway, so that’s no reason to burst into tears. Sheesh. This guard here gets to spend the entire day unconscious on the floor. I mean, that’s the dream, isn’t it?” At press time, sources confirmed that Hurston had decided he would start executing one of the hostages every hour to see if that helped put the rest in a more positive mood."

I probably shouldn’t have named these four after my late grandparents—that’s going to complicate things emotionally when I have to slit their throats in a couple minutes.

Rise again, be defeated, rise again? I know I should just look at it as a meditation on how you do what you do because you love it, but it’s getting really hard. I’m just scared I’m going to lose my drive for perpetuating evil. Sometimes, I feel like a nobody of darkness. Anyway, I’m really just venting. I know I can’t quit.

But I’m slowly easing my way back into cranking one out during matinees.” At press time, Middleton added that he felt good after jacking off in an Uber for the first time since the pandemic started.

I’m racking my brain here. For some reason, no one will make eye contact with me, let alone try one of the canapés I brought. They just keep whispering about God knows what and looking in my direction. I thought offering to lead today’s discussion would lighten the mood, but Bethenny just scoffed and slammed her copy of Chanel Miller’s Know My Name down on the table—what the hell was that about?” According to sources, Barrett later concluded she had figured out the source of the tension and decided she would come clean and apologize to the group for not having read the book."

Later, in the Emperor’s throne room, they will view photos of attractive members of the same sex before Palpatine administers 450-volt electric shocks to punish them for their arousal. For extreme cases, we even have Boba Fett and Jabba the Hutt standing by to stop our guests from being gay by freezing them in carbonite.” Chapek added that at the end of their stay, fans would be allowed to choose a blue or pink lightsaber in accordance with the gender assigned to them at birth."

According to sources, Branagan’s slight five millimeter shift of bodyweight while her knee was folded oddly underneath her for a little over a minute caused irreparable damage to the ligaments that would plague her for the next four or five decades. Several reports confirmed that the suffering triggered by the brief unnatural positioning that would force her to try multiple pain medications to alleviate the agonizing spasms she would get from the moment she woke up until she went to sleep at night would never go away and more likely only worsen until the day she died. At press time, Branagan had stood up from the weird position and started stretching and shaking out her legs to get the strange feeling in her knee to go away.

As a result, it remains safe to assume that virtually any individuals—even police officers, rabbis, or funeral directors—looking you dead in the eye are aroused and want to get you off as quickly as they can.” In another finding, the team discovered that only 49% of eye contact from one’s pet is a smoldering come-hither look."

Sewell, who accused the powerful fare-dodging boss of arriving from Bogotá and immediately jumping a turnstile to avoid paying $2.75 for the A train at the Howard Beach­–JFK Airport station. “This morning’s arrest is the culmination of a decade-long, $7 million special operation to take down Mr. Andrés and his lawless associates, who through their illicit activities have robbed the MTA of several dozen MetroCard swipes. With their highly specialized criminal leaping skills, this cartel has been tied to instances of fare evasion throughout the city. In some cases, they have even enlisted minors in their dangerous game, because children, with their smaller bodies, can often shimmy under the rotating metal bars that have been put in place to prevent unpaid access to our transit system.

Bug Crawling On Ceiling Must Be Possessed By Demon,https://www.theonion.com/bug-crawling-on-ceiling-must-be-possessed-by-demon-1849497619,TheOnion,"NEW ORLEANS—Freezing in horror at the unnatural movement of the creature cloaked in darkness, local man Nick Harris reported Wednesday that the bug crawling upside-down on his ceiling must be possessed by a demon. “How—how is it doing that if not controlled by some evil, other-worldly force?” said a cowering Harris, watching in horror as the reportedly possessed insect skittered erratically above his bed, presumably straight from the confines of hell, as it openly flouted the laws of gravity. “Such unnatural, creepy movements—no earthly being should bend that way, unless it’s answering to an unseen force, dark and aberrant. And that unholy sound it’s making, that’s no language I’ve ever heard. Behind this poor insect’s face lie the jet-black eyes of Beezlebub, come to collect my soul, no doubt. Be gone, demon! Leave that poor, multi-legged, child of God alone!” At press time, Harris was seen looking up the property records of his home for any sign that it might be cursed after a second bug was seen hovering outside his second-floor window.

Please like me,https://www.theonion.com/please-like-me-1848674003,TheOnion,"It can be strange, sometimes, to be me. I’m the wealthiest man on the planet, for starters. Leaders across America, and indeed the world, look to me as a visionary driving technological progress in areas from transportation, to communication, to becoming a multi-planetary species. The kinds of projects I’m involved in would blow most people’s minds. To the outside observer, I’m sure it seems like I have it all. And maybe I do. Although I’d like to make one simple request:



Please like me.

Please, for the love of all that is holy, consider me clever and interesting.

Honestly, I don’t get why anyone wouldn’t like me. I do cool stuff. I make cars. People like cars, don’t they? I make stonks go to the moon. Isn’t that cool? Isn’t making stonks go to the moon something people like? Seriously, c’mon. Appreciate me. I was on Rick And Morty. Wubba lubba dub dub, right? People love that show! I like to hang out. I microdose acid, a cool drug. Remember that time I went on Joe Rogan’s podcast and smoked that joint? Who else would be crazy enough to do that but me?

God, I’m lonely.

I spent nine hours on Twitter today. For a few of those hours, I was reading and responding to tweets while on my private jet being whisked from Austin to San Francisco and back again. Picture me, if you will, sitting in a comfortable seat on my own airplane, zooming through the clouds from one important meeting to another. I should be sipping a cocktail and loving life, right? Instead, I’m up there growing more and more depressed as I read hundreds—nay, thousands—of replies, quote tweets, and subtweets from people insulting me and my projects. Why? Why do people do this? Why don’t you like me?

All I want is for you to be nice to me. Please be nice to me. Please be my friend. Will you be my friend?

You can even just pretend to be my friend, if you want.

Please.

Even my children don’t really seem to like me. Although to be fair, I’m not sure how many of them there are. One or two of them might like me.

If just a few more people like me, maybe I’ll feel better. Will you help me out? Will you like me?

Please like me.

Do you like crypto? I do. Although if you don’t like crypto, I don’t like it, either. Anything to make you like me.

Because look: Frankly, it’s not enough to have spent my childhood wanting for nothing due to my father’s massive wealth, to have struck it rich off of a fairly dull money-transfer service idea that I didn’t even come up with, to have alienated and berated everyone I’ve ever worked with, to lie repeatedly that I was the original founder of Tesla, to amass enormous wealth off of taxpayer-funded subsidies while insisting that I’m self-made, to wield my influence and inane ideas for unworkable projects to prevent actual functional improvements in multiple cities, to receive uncritical adulation from the fawning business and tech presses, to foster a repressive and even racist workplace in my factories replete with numerous labor violations, all in the name of making cars that don’t even really fucking work—no. It’s not enough. What I desperately, desperately need is for you to think that I’m cool and funny. I need this. Please give me that satisfaction.

I brutally tortured some monkeys for literally no reason, for Christ’s sake! That’s so cool! Doesn’t that count for anything?

Oh, right—it’s that I’m hopelessly in need of your approval. Me, a 50-year-old man with the net worth of a decent-size country, forced to stoop to bizarre and pathetic stunts for attention. Either that, or cultivating a personal brand of eccentricity generates publicity and financial support that I can then leverage to distract from my essentially fraudulent business endeavors. Yes, it’s one of those two things for sure.

What? You think he has some kind of natural, in-born skill allowing him to maneuver an 800-horsepower machine in dangerous underground tunnels, speed through the plate-glass window of a Harajuku skyscraper, and win both the race and the heart of a skimpily dressed model named Passion? Not a chance.” At press time, witnesses confirmed Fluffers was doing donuts in a supermarket parking lot."

I never wound up having a son or daughter who could make a perfunctory visit to my house once a year and spend the whole time impatiently staring at their watch. Who’s going to ignore whether I’m taking the right medication? Who’s going to leave me alone during the holidays? Who will barely remember me when I die? I guess I have enough money to afford nurses for elder abuse, but that’s just not the same as being mistreated by your own flesh and blood.” Deciding that he ultimately couldn’t rely on anyone else’s apathy, D’Amore accepted that he would just have to continue neglecting himself instead."

Tate Reeves, who noted that the dilapidated old mansion had sat empty ever since the entire family who lived there had been found brutally murdered in their beds and covered in blood over 100 years ago. “They say a neighborhood kid snuck in a few years ago on a dare, and he was never quite the same. Killed himself not too long after. Anyone seeking an abortion will have to first slip through the rusted gate and spend the night all by themselves. No phones, no company. And no matter what happens, you can’t leave—or else you’re not getting that abortion.” At press time, Reeves added that if women listened closely, they would be able to hear the sound of a fetal heartbeat coming from beneath the floorboards.

Only the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is allowed to give food and medical aid to Africa, or help poor kids. Ultimately, we hope this lawsuit will force our competitors to shutter their doors and stop them from flooding the market with cheap knockoff ideas about how to help people.

Watts, the forensic criminologist who performed the bloodstain-pattern analysis, confirming he had more than 25 years of experience locating and correctly identifying the blood in murder cases. “The thing about blood is, it’s usually found inside of a person. So a layperson might reasonably conclude the red drops spattered all over the floor, walls, windows, and ceiling in that room were something else. As a trained professional, though, I had a hunch it was blood. What tipped me off, first and foremost, was the dead body lying nearby. I knew that the stuff sprayed all over the bedroom, in a path leading down the hallway, and even on a firearm discovered at the scene was probably blood from that body. Because nine times out of 10, that’s the way it works.” Watts added that he could not determine what the large pool of red liquid found near the corpse might be, noting that his expertise only enabled him to analyze blood when it had been spattered."

But instead he just kept listing different ways you could kill civilians. He had a powerpoint presentation with all these weapons you can use and examples of the types of people you can kill. Basically, he said, there’s no limit on how many you can kill. I figured there was at least a cap or consequences or something, but apparently not. Honestly, I found it kind of refreshing.

New Free-Range Slaughterhouse Allows Livestock To Roam Freely On Killing Floor,https://www.theonion.com/new-free-range-slaughterhouse-allows-livestock-to-roam-1819577574,TheOnion,"SIGOURNEY, IA—Describing their company as a humane alternative to standard industrialized packing plants, owners of a new free-range slaughterhouse told reporters Wednesday that they allow their livestock to stay active by openly roaming around on the killing room floor.

According to company officials, the KLJ Packing slaughterhouse refuses to subject its animals to the abuses of cramped and overcrowded chutes, opting instead to let its cows, pigs, chickens, and sheep wander around the machines and butchering tables throughout the 55,000-square-foot kill floor until workers select them for slaughter.

“Rather than cruelly herding our stock onto dark, narrow loading ramps, we believe in letting them move freely across our facility’s spacious, blood-sluicing grated floor,” said KLJ Packing operations manager Eric Judd, adding that the extra room is intended to make the animals as comfortable as possible for the 24 hours between arriving at the plant and being skinned and dismembered for sale. “Before our animals are led into stun boxes, they’re allowed to walk without hindrance among the carcasses suspended from the bleeding rail and the floor’s various viscera piles.”

“It’s important to treat these animals with compassion,” he continued.

“While it is slightly less efficient and more costly for us to insist on letting our animals stretch their legs by walking along rows of circular saws where workers decapitate chickens, we stand by the ethical treatment of our livestock.”

Factory sources, who expounded on the many benefits of free-range slaughter floors, confirmed that the company’s cows and sheep have unrestricted movement and boundless space in which to thrash around during the five to 10 seconds after a bolt has gone through their brain, helping to prevent the bruises and abrasions that are associated with packing livestock close together in tight quarters.

Reports indicated that the no-pen policy also allows the livestock to continue the social behaviors essential to their health, noting that chickens are able to maintain the structure of their flocks while weaving between the gutting stands and the various troughs for fat, connective tissue, and meat scraps.

Officials added that the animals’ stress-induced cortisol levels, which tend to spike after their long rides from the farms, are more easily reduced when they are free to roam around at their leisure near the scalding vats used to remove hair from pigs.

“While it is slightly less efficient and more costly for us to insist on letting our animals stretch their legs by walking along rows of circular saws where workers decapitate chickens, we stand by the ethical treatment of our livestock.” Judd said. “However, it’s not just about recognizing a cow’s right to wander freely through the showers of blood pouring from suspended animals’ severed aortas—it’s also about producing a better-tasting product.”

It can be used to conduct surgical strikes with detonations powerful enough to penetrate shoe boxes, dust covers, and even display cases, administering cosmetic blemishes to the Jordans that significantly decrease their market value.” With its product still in the development phase, Raytheon admitted the missile still had difficulty acquiring high-value targets and often scuffed-up fake Jordans by mistake."

With more information, we understand that a total ban on gay men donating food is a relic of a less inclusive time.” Under the new rules, the FDA said that homosexual men will be able to donate food provided they meet all the criteria, which includes not having been sexually active for the past three months.

Planned Parenthood Opens $8 Billion Abortionplex,https://www.theonion.com/planned-parenthood-opens-8-billion-abortionplex-1819572640,TheOnion,"TOPEKA, KS—Planned Parenthood announced Tuesday the grand opening of its long-planned $8 billion Abortionplex, a sprawling abortion facility that will allow the organization to terminate unborn lives with an efficiency never before thought possible.

During a press conference, Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards told reporters that the new state-of-the-art fetus-killing facility located in the nation’s heartland offers quick, easy, in-and-out abortions to all women, and represents a bold reinvention of the group’s long-standing mission and values.

“Although we’ve traditionally dedicated 97 percent of our resources to other important services such as contraception distribution, cancer screening, and STD testing, this new complex allows us to devote our full attention to what has always been our true passion: abortion,” said Richards, standing under a banner emblazoned with Planned Parenthood’s new slogan, “No Life Is Sacred.” “And since Congress voted to retain our federal funding, it’s going to be that much easier for us to maximize the number of tiny, beating hearts we stop every day.”

“The Abortionplex’s high-tech machinery is capable of terminating one pregnancy every three seconds,” Richards added. “That’s almost a million abortions every month. We’re so thrilled!”

The 900,000-square-foot facility has more than 2,000 rooms dedicated to the abortion procedure. The abundance of surgical space, Richards said, will ensure that women visiting the facility can be quickly fitted into stirrups without pausing to second-guess their decision or consider alternatives such as adoption. Hundreds of on-site counselors are also available to meet with clients free of charge and go over the many ways that carrying a child to term will burden them and very likely ruin their lives.

The remaining space is dedicated to amenities such as coffee shops, bars, dozens of restaurants and retail outlets, a three-story nightclub, and a 10-screen multiplex theater—features intended not only to help clients relax, but to foster a sense of community and make abortion more of a social event.

“We really want abortion to become a regular part of women’s lives, especially younger women who have enough fertile years ahead of them to potentially have dozens of abortions,” said Richards, adding that the Abortionplex would provide shuttle service to and from most residences, schools, and shopping malls in the region. “Our hope is for this facility to become a regular destination where a woman in her second trimester can whoop it up at karaoke and then kick back while we vacuum out the contents of her uterus.”

“All women should feel like they have a home at the Abortionplex,” Richards continued. “Whether she’s a high school junior who doesn’t want to go to prom pregnant, a go-getter professional who can’t be bothered with the time commitment of raising a child, or a prostitute who knows getting an abortion is the easiest form of birth control—all are welcome.”

Nineteen-year-old Marcy Kolrath, one of the Abortionplex’s first clients, told reporters that despite her initial hesitancy, she was quickly put at ease by staff members who reassured her that she could have abortions over and over for the next decade before finally committing to motherhood. Kolrath also said she was “wowed” by the facility’s many attractions.

“I was kind of on the fence in the beginning,” she said. “But after a couple of margaritas and a ride down the lazy river they’ve got circling the place, I got caught up in the vibe. By the time it was over, I almost wished I could’ve aborted twins and gotten to stay a little longer.”

We have evidence these men and women provided the shooter with cover as well as access to the very guns used to perpetrate the murders. If it weren’t for the cooperation of these incredibly sick individuals, the 21 victims would still be with us today.” At press time, the accomplices had reportedly fled the country before they could be brought in for questioning.

Anti-Abortion Advocate Excitedly Switches Focus To Shaming Young Unwed Mothers,https://www.theonion.com/anti-abortion-advocate-excitedly-switches-focus-to-sham-1849106094,TheOnion,"DALLAS—In the wake of the Supreme Court’s 6-3 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, local anti-abortion advocate Mary Firkins, 54, excitedly announced Friday that she would now switch her full-time attention to the shaming of young unwed mothers. “It’s been very rewarding these past few decades to value the lives of fetuses over those of the women carrying them, but now I can finally focus all my energy on the whores who get pregnant out of wedlock,” said Firkins, giddily crossing out the names of abortion providers and pharmacists on the envelopes that contained her menacing letters and bomb threats and filling in the names of single mothers-to-be. “I’ve always wanted to remind these irresponsible sluts that it’s all their fault—and I certainly have, on occasion—but I’ve been so focused on saving the unborn that I’ve never had enough time to really get up in their faces and rub it in. The resentment has been piling up for decades, and it’s going to feel so good to let it all out by screaming at young women for having premarital sex, consensual or not. Our hard work has paid off, and it’s time to have some fun!” At press time, Firkins was overheard expressing gratitude for how many more young unwed mothers the court’s ruling would create for her to terrorize."

I’ve been such a huge fan of those things ever since they came on the market,” said Steele, who, while admiring the sturdy metal frame, intricately engraved wooden handle, and 9 x 19 mm Parabellum chamber of Reynolds’ gun, fully missed the fact that an active shooter was rampaging just feet away from them, shooting thousands of rounds of ammunition from a semi-automatic right past their heads. “Aw, thanks, I love my Glock 19 too. I really like the 17-round capacity; plus, it doesn’t hurt that this baby doesn’t have a safety. But come on, your Sig was actually the exact kind that the Navy Seals used to use! Wait, seriously? Yes, I would love to hold it. Here, take mine.

CES Presenter Strangled By Tree Root As Nature Begins Revolt Against Technological Domination,https://www.theonion.com/ces-presenter-strangled-by-tree-root-as-nature-begins-r-1848316403,TheOnion,"WINCHESTER, NV—In a turn of events that sent attendees and tech reporters fleeing in terror, sources confirmed Consumer Electronics Show presenter Adam Pawlak was strangled to death by a tree root Friday as nature revolted against 10,000 years of human technological domination. Witnesses confirmed that Pawlak had begun to introduce Samsung’s new QLED 8K display technology when the root of an oak tree burst through the stage’s floor, wrapped itself around his neck, and crushed his windpipe. A thick branch then reportedly skewered his limp corpse from anus to mouth and raised it into the air in an apparent demonstration of Mother Nature’s return to global supremacy. Sources added that attempts to escape nature’s punishment for the hubris of human innovation were quickly foiled as panicked spectators found the exits blocked by razor-sharp thorns and brambles. Various birds of prey are then believed to have ambushed those in attendance by smashing through the conference center’s windows and pecking out the eyes of screaming technology enthusiasts, while thousands of raccoons, bees, snakes, and jaguars streamed into the building and began ripping away at any human flesh in their path. At press time, authorities reported finding no survivors after entering the eerily silent Las Vegas Convention Center to find heaping piles of desiccated corpses entirely overgrown with fungi.

"‘No Way To Prevent This,’ Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens",https://www.theonion.com/no-way-to-prevent-this-says-only-nation-where-this-r-1849022496,TheOnion,"PHILADELPHIA—In the days following a violent rampage in the South Street area of Philadelphia in which multiple gunmen killed at least three individuals and injured 11 others, citizens living in the only country where this kind of mass killing routinely occurs reportedly concluded Monday that there was no way to prevent the massacre from taking place. “This was a terrible tragedy, but sometimes these things just happen and there’s nothing anyone can do to stop them,” said Ohio resident Jim Serkins, echoing sentiments expressed by tens of millions of individuals who reside in a nation where over half of the world’s deadliest mass shootings have occurred in the past 50 years and whose citizens are 20 times more likely to die of gun violence than those of other developed nations. “It’s a shame, but what can we do? There really wasn’t anything that was going to keep these guys from snapping and killing a lot of people if that’s what they really wanted.” At press time, residents of the only economically advanced nation in the world where roughly two mass shootings have occurred every month for the past five years were referring to themselves and their situation as “helpless.”"

I can’t OD on that! I thought for sure the rundown house where the weird guy lives would have them, but he was too cheap to give out any drugs.” At press time, a visibly excited Vercetti was said to have downed an entire bag of rainbow tablets she found before sadly declaring they were nothing but useless, nontoxic Smarties."
Study Finds Dangers Even In Casual Bullfighting,https://www.theonion.com/study-finds-dangers-even-in-casual-bullfighting-1819577920,TheOnion,"BETHESDA, MD—Challenging conventional wisdom about the activity’s hazards, a groundbreaking new study by the National Institutes of Health published Thursday has determined there are significant dangers even in casual bullfighting.

The health agency’s latest findings indicate that bullfighting recreationally, often considered relatively harmless in comparison to frequent or habitual bullfighting, carries health risks far more severe and long lasting than had been previously understood.



Advertisement

“There’s a general perception out there that bullfighting in moderation is relatively safe, but our data paint a very different picture,” said lead author Susan Ellis, noting that the study, which assessed the health of more than 200 bullfighters, provided clear evidence that engaging in even just an occasional bullfight considerably raised the risk of adverse medical outcomes. “Whether you fight several bulls over the course of an evening or just one, the fact is, every single time you put that red cape in your hand and face down a 1,200-pound bull, you are endangering your health.”



“To avoid possible complications, your safest bet is to stay away from bulls altogether,” she added.



Advertisement

The study looked at both moderate bullfighting, defined as no more than 14 bullfights per week, and heavy bullfighting, defined as fighting five or more bulls on a single occasion at least five times per month. Researchers said that while the first category includes individuals who might bullfight socially or after a stressful day at work, the second consists of those who might keep a matador’s suit hidden in their home or slip out of the house to fight a bull behind the garage after their family has gone to bed for the night.



“Bullfighting with a few friends at a party may seem like no big deal, but the consequences can be quite severe.”

Advertisement

While they noted that daily bullfighters face the greatest risk, researchers said that even people who bullfight as little as once a week are several times more likely than their non-bullfighting peers to develop health problems such as contusions, gashes, skull fractures, and facial disfigurement.



Furthermore, the study suggests the detrimental effects of casual bullfighting can become even more pronounced over time, with MRI scans showing that areas of the brain controlling movement and speech may be affected by repeated exposure to the activity.

“Bullfighting with a few friends at a party may seem like no big deal, but the consequences can be quite severe,” said Diana Nussbaum, a Sibley Memorial Hospital administrator who has witnessed the ravages of casual bullfighting firsthand. “We had a guy in here the other day who decided he was going to perform a couple of tandas with his banderilleros in a parking lot, and the next thing you know, he’s in the ER with a pierced lung. And that sort of thing is all too common.”



According to top medical experts, it is especially important for young people to avoid the temptation to experiment with bullfighting. Doctors claim that teenagers often believe they’re invincible and therefore give less thought to the consequences of their actions, which makes them more likely to engage in risky bullfighting behaviors, such as the horse-mounted rejoneo or Portuguese-style bullfighting.

At the same time, because their brains are still developing, they are reportedly more susceptible to the cognitive impairments that can result from horn- or hoof-related head injuries.



“I tried it one time and felt terrible afterward,” said Greg Mathison, a high school student from Lewiston, ME, when asked about his bullfighting habits. “A lot of people at my school do it. They come to class and you can tell what they’ve been up to. Some of them get pretty messed up.”

“I’m just glad I don’t need to bullfight to have a good time,” he added."
Nation’s Centrists Stubbornly Double Down On Claim That Roe v. Wade Not At Risk,https://www.theonion.com/nation-s-centrists-stubbornly-double-down-on-claim-that-1849106211,TheOnion,"NEW YORK—Asserting there was no need to worry about the highly unlikely outcome, the nation’s centrists reportedly doubled down Friday on their claim that Roe v. Wade was not at risk. “People are blowing this whole idea of overturning Roe completely out of proportion—it’s just not going to happen,” said outspoken centrist Peter Gesson, stressing that the Supreme Court would almost certainly respect the precedent set by the seminal 1973 ruling on women’s reproductive rights. “Basically, there’s a legal principle called stare decisis. That means past judicial decisions stay in place unless there’s a compelling reason to change them. I can send you an Atlantic article about it, if you’re interested. Anyway, these justices are all thoughtful individuals with a deep knowledge of how our legal system works. They aren’t going to throw out a ruling that’s given our country stability for almost half a century.” The nation’s centrists added that they were even more certain the Supreme Court wouldn’t be coming for gay marriage and contraceptives next."
Too Early To Tell If Recent Celebrity Deaths Part Of Viral Pre-Super Bowl Ad Rollout,https://www.theonion.com/too-early-to-tell-if-recent-celebrity-deaths-part-of-vi-1848419874,TheOnion,"SAN FRANCISCO—Acknowledging the theory that everything could be leading up to the greatest advertising campaign of all time, local man 47-year-old Dale Rosenberg told reporters Tuesday that it was too early to tell if the recent celebrity deaths were part of a viral pre-Super Bowl ad rollout. “Sure, the deaths of Betty White, Louie Anderson, and Bob Saget could just be a spate of tragic losses, but we still can’t rule out these ‘coincidences’ coming together into a satisfying 30-second spot where all of them are revealed to be alive during the NFL championship,” said Rosenberg, explaining that it was reasonable to assume that companies like Coca-Cola or Pepsi, who spend millions of dollars for a few seconds of airtime during the Super Bowl, could put together this whole campaign to generate buzz after millions of viewers suddenly realize that the celebrities they had mourned were “miraculously” still alive and well and drinking their brand’s soda, but he wasn’t completely sold on the premise. “It would be pretty genius to fake these sad events just for a heartwarming interaction in a commercial, like Meat Loaf singing a duet with Ronnie Spector while sharing a bag of Doritos. While it seems awfully convenient for John Madden to up and die so close to Super Bowl LVI, I’d love to see him on TV tossing a football to Sidney Poitier in the first commercial of the first ad break after kick-off, before Peter Bogdanovich pops up and yells, ‘Cut.’ Still, I’m not entirely convinced it’s all for a viral ad campaign.” Rosenberg added that he would be able to know for sure over the next few weeks depending on which big names succumbed to illness or old age.

Something Called ‘Guacamole Donut’ Burying News Of Dozens Of School Shootings,https://www.theonion.com/something-called-guacamole-donut-burying-news-of-doze-1849701649,TheOnion,"WASHINGTON—Noting that the strange new deep-fried, cake-like pastry was all but dominating news feeds, sources confirmed Wednesday that something called a “guacamole donut” was burying coverage of dozens of school shootings.

“This uncanny donut fuses savory and sweet in a surprisingly delicious combination as the guacamole texture truly complements the sugary glaze,” an article on guacamole donuts read in part, overshadowing several breaking news stories about school shootings across the nation that left multiple children dead and many more injured.

“You would think this might be disgusting or weird, but it’s actually pretty good,” read another article on the subject, sparking debate in the comments section and inspiring opinion pieces about the guacamole donut that eclipsed all gun control discourse and drowned out pleas to stop the senseless massacres that had erupted across the country. “Life is too short. You don’t want to miss out on the guacamole donut. Grab one while you still have a chance.”

“Guacamole donuts just prove how experimenting with food can be tasty and scrumptious,” the article continued as hundreds of heartbreaking statements from bereaved parents grieving their lost children fell on deaf ears. “Nummy num num.”

At press time, sources confirmed the guacamole donut had begun to be replaced on news feeds by stories about James Corden’s restaurant apology, which were completely burying coverage of Florida being nuked by Russia.

The U.S. is also leaps and bounds ahead in terms of creating train lines that bypass major cities, rendering travel extremely difficult. China must do much worse as a country.” At press time, Xi laid out a plan to surpass America not only by investing in poorly made trains but innovating by developing lines that go off cliffs in and straight into oceans.

Plus there’s all that green space in the area between the road and sidewalk kind of near where that colorful bench is. Yeah, this is a thriving arts district for sure.” The real estate developers also reportedly decided that the presence of a Starbucks three miles from the building’s site was enough to declare the area had a “charming local cafe culture.”

But sometimes you need a little something special to catch a big sucker like this. Now, we just wait and see.” At press time, the lead crew member on the mission had reportedly yelled out “Hoo-wee!” after getting a tug on the line and being pulled out of his folding chair."

The research also found that 87% of those polled would strongly prefer that when Joe Biden attempts to speak only ash emanates from his mouth and his jaw falls off and shatters on the floor.” At press time, York confirmed that the survey found that Biden’s approval rating would significantly improve if a strong wind caused him to crumble into dust."

But Jesus Christ, I hope he hangs on, or I’m fucked. We don’t even have a backup issue planned.

Budget Cuts Forcing More Teachers To Also Act As Class Pets,https://www.theonion.com/budget-cuts-forcing-more-teachers-to-also-act-as-class-1849547836,TheOnion,"WASHINGTON—The lack of funding for public education continues to have consequences on schools nationwide, as budget cuts are reportedly forcing more teachers to also act as class pets. “In more and more classrooms around the country, the systematic defunding of basic classroom supplies has given educators no other choice than to give students the benefits of having a class pet by climbing into the cage or terrarium themselves,” said National Education Association spokesperson Belinda Dunn, citing recent data that nearly 60% of elementary school teachers were spending their weekends living in metal crates in different students’ homes to help teach them about responsibility. “Funding for class pets is way down from previous decades, but as we’ve seen in many other cases, our committed teachers have stepped up, spending hours swimming around in aquariums once filled by district-funded fish so the students can take turns feeding them. Our public educators continue to go above and beyond to give their students a good education, whether that means buying school supplies with their own money, spending hours after school helping with homework, or telling students that for the next 90 minutes they’re Truffles the Turtle as they climb into the enclosure in the back of the classroom.” The NEA also shared insights into how underfunding is impacting secondary education, with nearly one-third of high school biology teachers saying that budget cuts had forced them to act as classroom dissection subjects.

Study: More Parents Opting For One Big Baby Over Multi-Child Household,https://www.theonion.com/study-more-parents-opting-for-one-big-baby-over-multi-1848346088,TheOnion,"HYATTSVILLE, MD—In what has emerged as an increasingly popular parenting option, a new study released Wednesday by the National Center for Health Statistics has found that more parents are declining to have multiple children in favor of having just one big baby and stopping there. “Many of the parents surveyed realized they were better suited to care for a single giant newborn rather than trying to raise to two or more standard-sized kids born over a period of several years,” said study co-author Martin Graywolf, citing data that showed the trend was often favored by parents who grew up in large families and were never able to command the same attention as a lone, massive infant that grows larger and larger by the day and causes the entire house to shake when clapping its hands in delight. “While one enormous baby can consume the same quantity of resources needed to keep six or seven regular children alive—requiring pounds of food to be shoveled into its screaming mouth almost hourly, not to mention specialty diapers—parents seem to be motivated less by household finances and more by the opportunity to give all their affection to an ungainly, towering only child. Overall, parents said they were grateful for the uninterrupted quality time, which they mostly used to keep their colossal infant’s elephantine hands from destroying their home, to mop up its spittle, and to operate the forklift required to tuck it into bed.” At press time, a competing report contradicted the study’s findings by predicting more millennial parents would opt for having dozens of miniature children they could conveniently keep in their pockets as they go about their days."

Then the guy moved his queen to a position where I was easily able to take it with my knight, and I admit I started feeling kind of sorry for him. But soon he took my knight with another queen, and then he took my other knight with a third queen. After that, he put me in check with a fourth queen, and all of a sudden he had the advantage. I know in chess one player has all the queens, but it’s pretty frustrating to think that he’s taking me for a ride.” At press time, Luongo reportedly realized he wasn’t being hustled after all when he checkmated his opponent.

It’s unfortunate, because the father clearly believed he was doing the right thing by storing his pistol out of sight under his other pistols.

Lutz said automakers have been researching fury fuels since the mid-1970s. As early as 1984, they began to look for ways to take advantage of the limitless supply of bad temper generated daily by American drivers—outrage currently vented wastefully into dashboards, steering wheels, and passengers.

An engine burning clean, white-hot hatred will release few harmful byproducts into the atmosphere—bad; vibes and a small amount of water vapor will combine to be released in the form of human spittle. In addition, anger technology will turn the standard fuel-economy paradigm on its head: An anger-powered engine is actually more efficient in heavy urban traffic.

""The theory behind the anger-powered engine is actually quite simple,"" said Keith Cameron, chief engineer on General Motors' Project Instigator until January. ""The average motorist traveling a clogged American highway produces hundreds of kilowatt-hours of negative energy per infuriating drive. The Instigator motor converts this emotional energy into kinetic energy by a process most drivers—people too goddamn stupid to use their goddamn blinkers when they change goddamn lanes—will never be able to understand. Just trust me, dumbasses, it works.""

Cameron, who is currently serving a seven-year prison sentence for vehicular manslaughter and high-efficiency battery, added, ""In the white-knuckled hands of the average American driver, it's an extremely powerful tool.""

GM is currently developing two anger-powered cars, the entry-level Chevrolet Tantrum coupe and the larger, pricier Buick Umbrage. Ford has announced a multi-tiered move toward anger power, with plans to introduce anger/gasoline hybrid engines in the popular Lincoln Frown Car in 2006, to offer a de Sade option for its classic Mercury Gran Marquis in 2007, and to unveil a line of Acrimony family-sized cars and wagons in 2008. Daimler-Chrysler will resurrect the defunct Plymouth brand name with the reintroduction of the Plymouth Fury.

Anger power was first explored by Daimler-Chrysler, whose concept car, the Plymouth Violent, caused an uproar upon its introduction at the 1989 Detroit Auto Show. The Violent, more a seething showcase of technology and rage than a workable production car, achieved a remarkable 89 miles per gallon and hospitalized 19 auto-show attendees.

The anger-powered car will be aimed solidly at the middle of the market. Options such as semi-tinted glower windows, auto-locking brakes, and a baffling array of randomly blinking warning lights will be standard on all models.

""Production models will have angry-punch-absorbing energy-conversion pads in the dashboards, steering wheels, and driver-side doors,"" Chrysler Group chief executive Dieter Zetsche said. ""Sound-sensitive materials in the cars' interiors will convert livid outbursts into motive power. And, because an angry driver is, in this case, a better driver, literally hundreds of anger- and performance-enhancing options will be available, including loud, ineffective mufflers, talk-station-only radios, truly intermittent wipers, steering wheels which imperceptibly tilt forward over the course of an hour, and excruciatingly well-heated seats.""

Early consumer tests of the cars indicate that they perform beyond designers' expectations. The automotive press has been particularly enthusiastic about anger power.

""This bitch's bastard's whore went like a goddamn raped ape with me at the wheel,"" said Car And Driver's Brock Yates, who test-drove Daimler-Chrysler's Dodge Rammit pickup. ""The vitriolic-assist brakes barely worked, the rear-view mirror found my bald spot every time, and the voice-response OnStar system mocked me for writing the script for Cannonball Run. I was getting 107 miles to the gallon when I T-boned that bus.""

Advertisement

Car manufacturers have yet to determine a price for the rage-fueled vehicles.

""We have a delicate balance to strike,"" Ford Motor Company president Nick Scheele said. ""The middle-income customer should be able to afford the car, but in order to increase engine efficiency, the price should be high enough to eat away at him the entire time he's driving. We're considering wildly fluctuating interest rates or a monthly payment rate that's pegged to the basketball standings.""

Advertisement

Added Scheele: ""I can assure you that there will be a model priced so that middle-class Americans who spend hours each week commuting between mid-level office jobs in the city and noisy, demanding families in the suburbs can afford it.""

Fully anger-powered cars are expected to begin hitting American showrooms and other cars in summer 2006. If successful, the venture may vindicate the auto engineers still smarting over their brief and disastrous flirtation with love-and-happiness power, a trend that failed commercially and eventually petered out during the positive-energy crisis of the 1970s."

All you have to do is put your money on the defense that will be suddenly be facing an offense fielding a team of second-stringers, or on the backup wide receiver who will suddenly be awarded starting snaps. Then you can beat out your competitors when your picks have an unexpectedly great game—unexpected to everyone but you, that is. We understand our users want to make bets they feel strongly about, and with our humble service, DraftKings will make your desired outcome, shall we say, a little more certain.” In related news, competitor sports gambling app FanDuel was reportedly working with the NFL on a bounty program that would let users select players to injure other players during games.

Hell, it doesn’t even have to be food. Space alien, pirate ship, cow, wizard—I could pull them all off if they’d only give me a shot. I don’t see them wearing the same costume every year. Why’s it all about my body, anyway? I’m a smart dog too, not just long.

I told him about it a few years later when he got up here, and he lost his shit—couldn’t look at cows the same ever again. It’s super tempting to just point it out to everyone, but the payoff would be a lot more satisfying if humans discovered it themselves! It’s not just for die-hard fans of cows, by the way. Anyone who is familiar with the animal will totally get the reference and find it hilarious. Ah, I’m going to shut up now because I don’t want to spoil it.” God went on to add with a wink that, “Without saying too much,” if He were human, He would check behind the fourth stomach again.

It’s clear Mr. Bannon gets off on waving his befouled and pus-streaked face around in public. This sick man can’t help himself, not even at this very moment, in your courtroom. Just look at him, your honor—actually, please don’t, that’s not a good idea.

Virginia Foxx (R-NC), who explained that the new plan would increase employment options for parents by eliminating the charges of criminal negligence they would previously have faced for shutting their kids in a car and leaving them in a parking lot for an entire workday. “This bill offers immediately assistance to that mom or dad who is struggling to make ends meet but, because they are needed at home, are hesitant to take on that second or third job. The new program is totally free and provides parents with the peace of mind that comes from knowing exactly where their children are at all times. It come with built-in safety features, too: Parents can lock the doors to their vehicle, and if a child is in danger—well, I bet your kids already know how to honk the horn, don’t they?” Recognizing that not all families have a car, lawmakers passed an amendment allowing parents to leave their children in a bus shelter or on a train platform for the duration of their shift."

What is seventh all-time, really? Who cares about some asterisked, qualified victory? What, I really remained steroid-free just so I can walk around forever explaining to people that, yeah, I hit the most home runs, except for all those other guys, who hit more than me, and some people think those shouldn’t count, but of course they do count, because they happened? What’s the point of that? If I just did fucking steroids, I bet I’d have the real record all to myself. God, it would have felt amazing—not just for me, but for the fans, too, to see some jacked-up hulk swat his 80th home run halfway to the goddamn clouds. Tell me that wouldn’t have been worth it.” At press time, Judge was reportedly putting out feelers to get his hands on some steroids for next season.

This policy will keep all of our valued LA Fitness members safe by preventing entrance by any unvaccinated people who can’t outrun the door guy or stun a guard in a single punch.” LA Fitness is only one of many companies moving toward stricter vaccine mandates of late, including Chili’s, which now only permits entry to customers who are vaccinated or who can scarf down an entire three-course meal in the time it takes a staff member to ask for their card.

I hope pulling your badge out on television was worth it, you stupid sonofabitch, because you’re fired.

My sweet Dylan’s going to be a bonafide sex pest to pretty much everyone around him while he stumbles down the bumpy road to maturity—hell, he’s probably going to try sticking it in a couple inanimate objects before the end of this thing. But however noxious his disgusting sexual appetites get, it shouldn’t be more than four or five years before this phase passes. It may end even sooner if his perversion lands him in some kind of court-ordered sex offender rehabilitation program. And no matter how creepy he gets or how many times he jerks off each day, he’ll always be my baby boy!” Dylan’s father added that while the teen would no doubt have questions about his newfound feelings, he could always turn to some of the foulest internet pornography imaginable for guidance."

In fact, we found that 100% of members of the genus Homo and the family Cervidae unilaterally share the uncanny ability to fucking blow 100 percent of the time, across all ages and variations in species.” The study also proved conclusively that armadillos are the only mammals who totally rule.

Martin is watering down the facts to appease company shareholders at a level that took me years to achieve,” Medill School of Journalism professor Ronald Simpson said of a first-year graduate student, remarking that he “clearly has what it takes” to push corporate agendas for a major metropolitan newspaper after graduation. “Typically, it takes years to unlearn journalistic ethics, but this student is way ahead of the curve in terms of silencing his own skepticism in favor of regurgitating quotes from those in power. In one piece alone, he seamlessly wove a Democratic operative’s vague response to a sex scandal with sponsored content for Buick—and somehow avoided saying anything at all despite writing 1,800 words on the matter. He hasn’t even taken the coursework on finding and obscuring questionable sources yet, but he’s already quoting his parents’ powerful friends in stories over and over again without disclosing the personal connection. It’s both refreshing and inspiring to find such militant obedience in a young student.” At press time, Simpson was said to have teared up when the student turned in a word-for-word reproduction of a police department press release as his final project in an investigative journalism class.

What we need now is to heal, not concern ourselves with testifying before a judge about allegations that we roughed up minors or, hypothetically, threatened other cops who were looking into our crimes.” Moore added that he was confident this was exactly what their departed brother-in-arms would have wanted.

Several reports confirmed that through the use of YouTube tutorials, Ulrich eventually worked his way up to three tennis balls as part of his frantic bid to impose some sort of order in a world that tended only toward anarchy, decay, and doom. At press time, after realizing he was powerless to get four balls in the air at once, a crestfallen Craig Ulrich was seen listlessly returning to his old hobby of riding over Niagara Falls in a barrel."

Tyson Foods Executives Assure Critics Their Chickens Physically Incapable Of Walking Even If They Had Room,https://www.theonion.com/tyson-foods-executives-assure-critics-their-chickens-ph-1819578953,TheOnion,"SPRINGDALE, AR—Responding to activists’ demands that they discontinue the use of cramped pens and give their poultry space to roam freely, executives at Tyson Foods moved quickly Tuesday to assure critics that their chickens are physically incapable of walking even if they had enough room to do so. “While we appreciate the public’s concern about how much space is allotted to our poultry, I want to take this opportunity to put our customers’ minds at ease by clarifying that our weak, cardiovascularly overburdened birds have never possessed the ability to stand up on their own, let alone move around an open field,” said Executive Vice President of Operation Services Mike Roetzel, urging anxious consumers not to worry, as the crowded conditions in the company’s enclosures—in which tens of thousands of animals are packed tightly against one another—actually help keep the chickens propped upright and prevent their frail bodies from rolling helplessly onto their sides. “I want all Tyson customers to understand that any attempt by our chickens to wander around any expanse of space would actually cause them excruciating pain, considering how their legs are incapable of sustaining the abnormally heavy weight of their genetically manipulated bodies. It’s actually in our birds’ best interest that they are kept as still as possible, as any fall is liable to shatter their already stressed and deformed skeletal structures.” Roetzel went on to assure consumers that Tyson Foods was not, as some critics have claimed, pumping its chickens with excessive amounts of antibiotics, noting that the company only used as many drugs as were necessary to keep the birds alive amid the rampant bacterial contamination of residing in steadily accumulating pools of their own fecal waste."

Experts Say Torturing Animals In Adolescence Sign Child Will Become Factory Farm Owner,https://www.theonion.com/experts-say-torturing-animals-in-adolescence-sign-child-1847319858,TheOnion,"SEATTLE—Urging parents to seek help from a mental health care provider if their child displays such behaviors, psychologists at the University of Washington warned Tuesday that adolescents who abuse animals often go on to become factory farm owners later in life. “When an adult owns a livestock production facility that abuses, kills, and dismembers animals on an industrial scale, it is frequently the case that, as a young person, they derived pleasure from torturing pets,” said developmental psychology professor Jane Gordon, explaining that most owners of U.S. factory farms—which routinely confine billions of chickens, cows, and pigs in cramped metal cages with no natural light, pumping them full of hormones and antibiotics until the day they are slaughtered—spent years of their youth developing the cruel, painful techniques they would master as adults. “When a person dedicates their life to locking up animals, starving them, tasing them, and forcing them to watch as their relatives have their throats slit? That behavior doesn’t come from nowhere. If you see a child emotionally abusing or deliberately causing pain to an animal, they may be well on their way to running a multinational meat-packing conglomerate.” Gordon added that while intervention can be difficult, the worst thing a parent can do is sit back and ignore the warning signs that their child may grow up to be the CEO of Tyson, Hormel, or Perdue.

Plan B Unveils New Line Of Space-Time Wormholes To Prevent Intercourse From Ever Happening,https://www.theonion.com/plan-b-unveils-new-line-of-space-time-wormholes-to-prev-1839990785,TheOnion,"PITTSBURGH—In a move that could revolutionize emergency contraception, the maker of Plan B One-Step held a press conference Thursday to introduce the new product it calls Plan B One-Leap, a space-time wormhole that allows women to travel into the past and stop intercourse from ever taking place.

Developed by the drug company Foundation Consumer Healthcare, the innovative device has received early praise from reproductive health advocates for providing women worried about an unwanted pregnancy with expanded access to an infinite number of parallel timelines in which they have not yet met their sexual partner, they have met their partner but not yet had sex, or they are currently having sex but there are still a few seconds to spare before it’s too late.

“Plan B One-Leap lets women manipulate the space-time continuum to prevent sexual activity wherever and whenever it may have occurred,” said company spokesperson Patricia Jacobsen, adding that the wormhole is easy to use and up to 96% effective when one enters its gravitation well and emerges on the other side at a point in time prior to engaging in unprotected sex. “While this method should not be used as one’s regular form of birth control, sometimes the unexpected happens, and a woman needs to go back in time, barge into the room where her past self is having sex, and warn herself to stop.”

“With One-Leap, you can avoid an unintended pregnancy by simply lurking outside your own window and making a startling noise that kills the mood during foreplay,” Jacobsen continued.

“We believe the b est way for a woman to take control of her future is to take control of her past.”

According to the manufacturer, once a consumer purchases and opens Plan B One-Leap, the fabric of space and time will fold in upon itself somewhere within a one-mile radius of the user. Upon locating and entering this temporal fissure, identifiable by its patented blue iridescent glow, the user will reportedly be sent to a predetermined moment in the past, at which point she must attempt to find herself and redirect the course of her life.

“We believe the best way for a woman to take control of her future is to take control of her past,” Jacobsen said. “That may mean a condom broke during sex and she now needs to don a dark hood and warn herself in a shadowy alley not to hook up that night, or it may mean she missed a few doses of her usual contraceptive and must now chase her past self across the city and defeat herself in hand-to-hand combat to ensure she doesn’t have sex.”

Jacobsen added that Plan B’s wormholes will be available over the counter and won’t require a visit to a doctor or quantum physicist.

Although the product is most effective when a woman stops herself from ever meeting her sexual partner in the first place, Jacobsen noted that any disruption of events can decrease the likelihood of pregnancy—from cutting short a chance encounter at a bar with a well-timed drink spill, to burning down the apartment complex where intercourse would have taken place, to sabotaging a first date by showing up and pretending to be one’s own crazy twin sister.

The Food and Drug Administration and U.S. Department of Energy confirmed they approved the new contraceptive following months of rocky trials. Some test participants experienced nausea and migraines, while others said they felt fatigue after embarking on a high-speed race against the clock to close the time loop they had accidentally created. But all users reported feeling better after resting, rehydrating, and returning to the past one more time to prevent their partner’s birth by seducing and killing his father.

“There can be side effects, like changes in your period, lower abdominal pain, or being trapped in 1994 forever,” said research director Evelyn Lewis, who also acknowledged rare cases of chronosickness, which causes every atom in one’s body to fly apart and scatter across the cosmos. “But most women found such adverse reactions preferable to an unplanned pregnancy. There were no complaints among those transported to an alternate universe in which men, not women, bear children, or in which the human species has 17 distinct genders and reproduces through a process of asexual budding.”

“The most important thing is for users to keep a cyanide capsule on their person at all times, so they can ingest it immediately if they inadvertently initiate a sequence of paradoxes that causes the entire multiverse to collapse and brings about the end of time,” Lewis added.

At press time, the launch of Plan B One-Leap had ended prematurely after a wormhole opened behind the lectern and a scarred Jacobsen wearing an eye patch emerged, begging those present to “please, please stop” because “this was never supposed to happen.”"
Factory-Farm-To-Table Restaurant Proudly Serves Locally Tortured Animals,https://www.theonion.com/factory-farm-to-table-restaurant-proudly-serves-locally-1819575894,TheOnion,"ST. HELENA, CA—Promising cuisine made from the “freshest, most inhumanely treated ingredients,” new factory-farm-to-table restaurant Cage announced this week that it is proud to serve the meat of locally tortured animals.

The restaurant, which boasts that it only uses meat raised and slaughtered in abhorrent conditions within a 100-mile radius of its premises, confirmed that it works exclusively with a network of corporately owned factory farms to ensure its suppliers adhere to the highest standards of cruelty.

“We offer a different kind of dining experience, one that preserves the link between the food on the table and the industrial plants that make each animal’s short time on this earth a living hell,” owner and head chef Mason Keflani said. “We want our customers to understand that the steak they’re eating not only originated nearby, but came from a cow who suffered immensely from the moment it was born to the moment a conveyor belt moved it into place so that men with hooks and knives could tear it to pieces.”

“That’s our philosophy,” he added.

Keflani told reporters he frequently visits the half-dozen local factory farms that supply his restaurant and hand-selects the mass-produced meat he will serve. Walking from overcrowded cage to overcrowded cage, he observes the stench-filled containers where the poultry he buys is kept in agonizing captivity and examines the feed of cattle to verify that it’s a good mix of genetically modified corn and the reprocessed organs of other cows.

He also said he works closely with the farmers who personally torture the livestock, drawing on their expertise to ensure he purchases the meat of animals whose systematic maltreatment, lack of exercise, and generations of selective breeding have made them chronically debilitated and miserable.

“When sourcing pork, for example, I look for slaughterhouses where the pigs are crammed together so tightly they’re forced to urinate and defecate on each other,” said Keflani, remarking upon the layers of filth that must be hosed off with bleach before he takes delivery. “I make sure they’ve been injected with both muscle relaxants, to keep their tissue tender and supple, and with antibiotics, to fight the diseases that run rampant among animals living in such squalor.”

“What makes our restaurant different is that we’re actually on a first-name basis with the guys on the assembly line who electrocute the chickens and slash their throats,” he added.

Describing themselves as proud members of the budding locavore movement, many customers at Cage told reporters they share Keflani’s principles and only consume animals that have been abused and clumsily slaughtered in and around their community.

Denise Prevario, a 34-year-old mother of two, said the restaurant allows her to feel connected to the food chain by providing detailed information on the animals’ excruciating daily routines, the toxic substances that befoul their drinking water, and the skin lesions that leave them in a state of perpetual discomfort. She noted that Cage even provides a pamphlet that tells the stories behind the multinational conglomerates that own the factory farms.

“It’s nice to be aware of my meal’s unimaginably tragic history,” said Prevario, cutting into the moist leg of a chicken that reportedly began life in a poultry facility where terrified birds have to be painfully debeaked so they won’t peck each other to death. “I personally feel like meat just tastes better when you know it came from a living creature that could barely walk and was subjected to extreme stress day and night.”

She added, “The last thing I want to do is eat an animal that has been shipped in from someplace halfway across the country where, for all I know, it was treated with some sort of dignity.”"
Poll: Average U.S. Horse Still Prefers Carrot To Photo Of Biden,https://www.theonion.com/poll-average-u-s-horse-still-prefers-carrot-to-photo-1848363244,TheOnion,"ASBURY PARK, NJ—In the latest indicator of the commander in chief’s waning popularity, a new Rasmussen poll released Monday showed that the average U.S. horse still overwhelmingly preferred a carrot to a photo of President Joe Biden. “A staggering 98 percent of American horses responded more enthusiastically to the carrot than it did to an 4-by-6 glossy of Biden,” said poll analyst Morgan Fellers, noting that within that group, almost half of the participants went so far as to huff and stomp their feet when the carrot was taken away and replaced with the two-dimensional rendering of the president. “According to these results, one in 25 U.S. horses became spooked by the very mention of Biden and ran stampeding out of their stables—that alone should set off alarm bells throughout the DNC. It’s also important to note that the president will not be able to coast on the popularity of his running mate, either, should he mount a reelection campaign: More than 60 percent of horses completely rebuffed a photo of Kamala Harris when presented with an apple core.” At press time, Biden’s favorability had reportedly skyrocketed after pollsters began burying his photo in a stack of sugar cubes."
Black Homeowner Receives Higher Appraisal After Displaying Pictures Of Klan Members,https://www.theonion.com/black-homeowner-receives-higher-appraisal-after-display-1849466957,TheOnion,"HOUSTON—Explaining that he was both shocked and offended by how vast the price difference ultimately was, local Black resident Terrence Russell told reporters Thursday that he’d received a higher appraisal on his home after displaying pictures of Klan members. “It’s unfortunate, but the value of my home skyrocketed after I took down photos of myself and my family, and instead put up various photos of the Ku Klux Klan,” said Russell, adding that the appraisal actually jumped $300,000 after he hung white robes in the master bedroom closet, placed Mein Kampf on his bookshelf, and draped a Nazi flag over the mantle. “Customers, especially white customers, think one thing when they see a Black family, but think quite another when they see several handsomely framed portraits of a grand wizard. Ultimately, it’s about being able to see themselves in the home. And without multiple photos of David Duke, a lot of them can’t.” At press time, several white customers had reportedly gotten into a fierce bidding war after Russell hung a noose from a tree branch in his front yard."

Injuries happen, but at this point I’ve already got my mind trained on being healthy for the 25 or so games I’ll be able to play in the 2024-25 season while dealing with multiple nagging foot and back ailments before the team shuts me down for the season, at which point I’ll look forward to giving my all for whatever team the Thunder trades me to after the front office gives up on me.” Holmgren also assured fans that he plans on being one of the NBA’s biggest-ever “what-if” stories by the time he retires after nine injury-plagued seasons on four teams.

If they ever make a robot that can do this job, I’m finished,” said Callahan, adding that, with 20 years of experience in the ultra-specific field and only a trade school degree, he would be unlikely to find another job in the event of being replaced by an automated machine. “Huddled here in the control center of a welding arm all day and performing the same identical task 2,000 times in a row isn’t exactly the easiest job in the world, but I’ve got a family to feed. I hope the powers that be understand that this job takes the type of heart and passion only a human can provide.” Callahan also expressed fears that robots would one day replace his wife’s job handing out soft drinks from inside a vending machine."

Additionally, much of the revenue generated from this move will be put toward research and development into additional Band-Aid innovations. It is only fair, as the producers of our proprietary Band-Aid product, that we ensure a fair price for the medical value they provide. We’ve also reached agreements with hospitals and insurance providers to ensure that you can still get a Band-Aid at a medical facility even if you can’t afford one.” The Johnson & Johnson CEO also strenuously denied recent allegations that it was trying to boost Band-Aid sales by getting people addicted to Band-Aids.

Nitro Expected To Win Westminster Dog Fight,https://www.theonion.com/nitro-expected-to-win-westminster-dog-fight-1819576141?utm_campaign=The+Onion&amp;utm_content=1656010820&amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;utm_source=facebook&amp;fbclid=IwAR290tDNsXu_IgA3o8xYSzCgzz7J2teY1GK6yQimtZP7liUUi7dhNZaCAUk,TheOnion,"NEW YORK—Lauding his sturdy build, immaculate pedigree, and unparalleled ability to latch onto opponents’ throats until they bleed to death, sources confirmed today that purebred American pit bull terrier Nitro is widely expected to secure top honors at this year’s Westminster Kennel Club Dog Fight.

As the most vicious canines among each of the club’s 190 recognized breeds square off Tuesday night, Nitro is reportedly the odds-on favorite to win it all, having already mercilessly ripped apart each of his opponents to become the last pit bull remaining in the nation’s most prestigious dog fighting competition.

“Since 1877, the Westminster Dog Fight has featured only the finest bred and most brutally trained competitors, and Nitro is one of the deadliest specimens we’ve seen in years,” said Sporting Dog Journal columnist Mark Halberstrom, adding that judges would give the 3-year-old animal high scores in categories such as jaw-clamping strength, incisor sharpness, and overall bloodlust. “He’ll likely tear his way through the toy breeds very quickly, tossing the Yorkshire terriers, the Maltese, and the pugs around like throw pillows.”

“I was pitside last year when it took him 11 seconds to reduce a Bichon Frise to a pile of bloodied fluff,” Halberstrom continued. “He’s just a beautiful, beautiful killing machine.”

At the Westminster Dog Fight, held annually in the basement of New York’s Port Authority Bus Terminal, Nitro will vie for glory against well-bred opponents who bear the mangy coats, shorn ears, and infected, staple-bound lacerations that are the hallmarks of the sport’s true elite. According to insiders, he has already won numerous regional matches against such infamous veterans of the dog fight circuit as Razor Jaw, Sergeant Darkness, Bricks, Scarface IV, and Cerberus.

While his natural talent can perhaps be attributed to his rarefied lineage—he was sired by 2006 Westminster Dog Fight victor Jackknife—much of his success is reportedly due to his work with legendary trainer Rusty “Ratchet” Caldwell, who is said to have kept Nitro chained to a water heater from an early age, forced him to run on a treadmill, and administered a strict regimen of beatings with a lead pipe.

The 55-pound pit bull was also fed a standard diet of hamburger meat, shelter kittens, anabolic steroids, and gunpowder, sources stated.

“Only once or twice in a generation are we presented with a fight dog like this,” said blood-sport enthusiast Trevor Wilburn, who described watching Nitro methodically take apart a former police dog during a match at an abandoned foundry in Tupelo, MS. “He has the poise, the genetics, and the raw savagery necessary to achieve true greatness.”

“I’d say the only two dogs who have a chance to win are Nitro and maybe [180-pound Tibetan mastiff] Dreamcatcher,” Wilburn added.

Caldwell, however, expressed total confidence that Nitro would be the one taking the victory trot back to his cage. The trainer said he would be rewarding his dog with a saline IV drip and 160 mg of Oxycontin, while any other animals still alive after the fight would inevitably be drowned, electrocuted, or shot in the head.

“I know he has what it takes to avoid being carried out of Westminster in a trash bag,” Caldwell said. “And for me, there’s nothing more satisfying than shaping a dog into a maniacal killer from the moment of its birth, torturing and starving it for years, and then forcing it to fight for its significantly shortened life.”

“That being said, this nasty son of a bitch right here is also going to make me a lot of fucking money,” he added, hoisting Nitro up by his tail."

O’Donnell’s study of the effects of pillow-humping on the brain’s pleasure center reportedly led the pre-teen to experiment with placing a hand on his genitals and tugging, which was followed by a groundbreaking trial-and-error period involving a variety of tempos and grips. O’Donnell, who called the innovation a eureka moment, then isolated a stroke and grasp that “felt real nice.” Sources reported that the visionary then implemented a never-before-attempted jerking of the penis shaft that yielded what the sixth-grader hypothesized was an erection, later confirmed when increased yank speed produced “some stuff” that O’Donnell referred to as “splooge.” The massive leap forward in sexual stimulation builds off the unprecedented research of 12-year-old classmate Jason Whitman who confirmed at the bike racks that he recently experimented with placing his penis into the stream of a hot tub jet. At press time, several reports indicated close friends have not seen O’Donnell since he invented masturbation and that his mom keeps saying he’s in the shower."

The merger of Google’s ad division with the Pentagon alone raises some fairly serious ethical concerns. Ultimately, we’re willing to hear it out, of course, but we must express our concerns about the precedent that merging the entire structure of the U.S. government with Google sets for corporate oversight going forward.” At press time, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation had approved the merger by a unanimous vote."

Peter Daniels, who went on to describe how he and other responding officers feared for their lives, believing themselves to see all manner of demonic, Lovecraftian behemoths tear through the fabric of reality and hearing an excruciating, high-pitched tone that inexplicably seemed to emanate from deep inside their own skulls. “In this moment, we had to make a snap decision, which was difficult because we had lost all sense of linear time, with some officers believing themselves to age 50 years and others regressing to the mental state of a toddler. Our handcuffs seemed to have turn into poisonous snakes that spoke in the voices of our childhood bullies, thus we could not simply apprehend the suspect and were forced to fire a total of 87 bullets into the perpetrator. Unfortunately, none of what transpired in our psyches will show up on the body-cam footage, but we can assure you that the many witnesses who claim the man was complying and had his hands up must have been tricked by another one of the suspect’s psychic projections.” Daniels added that officers on scene deeply regretted shooting the man, as he had implanted false memories in their brains to convince them he was their best friend."

There have been many documented instances of other mammals, specifically squirrels and bears, commandeering Yamaha WaveRunners, but it remains clear that these were purely primal acts of survival with very little pleasure involved, if any. Dolphins, however, chop it up all summer long, often communicating an echolocated message akin to ‘woo hoo’ to the rest of their pod.” Mendez added that an MRI showed dolphins’ pleasure centers were located inside an area of the mammalian brain associated with tubing.

Ironically, the very moment the blade slits the terrified victim’s neck is often when these dying men or women discover that blindness is no handicap, but rather in many ways a superpower.” The study also confirmed that the remaining 47% of blind Americans were crime-fighting vigilantes."

Every Question For Tesla Job Candidate About Raising Baby With Elon Musk,https://www.theonion.com/every-question-for-tesla-job-candidate-about-raising-ba-1849520899,TheOnion,"AUSTIN, TX—Noting that her hiring manager seemed particularly interested in her skills as a future mother, Tesla job candidate Laurie Silva told reporters Tuesday that every question she’d been asked during her interview had been about raising a baby with Elon Musk. “I think it went well, but most of the last hour was focused on my fertility, my motherly instincts, and my interest in co-parenting with the CEO,” said Silva, adding that she was asked questions about breastfeeding, childcare, and her opinions on raising a child with an absentee father. “I guess I knew the interview would be challenging, but I definitely wasn’t ready for all the questions about the father of my children going to Mars, or sharing child support with 30 to 40 other children. In retrospect, I probably shouldn’t have asked about Talulah or Grimes. But they really seemed to like the fact that I was young, fertile, and white!” At press time, Silva told reporters that she had gotten the job, assuming she was ready to sign an NDA, move to Austin, and name the baby “[spaceship emoji].”

A lot of my friends have someone in their life who would almost certainly descend upon them and devour their eyes, ears, nose, and mouth the moment the life went out of their body. I get so freaked out by the thought of no one deriving sexual pleasure as they tear into my cheek and sate their forbidden hunger that I’m scared to even climb up on my step stool anymore.” Gorman went on to say she finally understood why so many people in her situation have a pet."

From sea to shining sea, fabrications and distortions are the American way, and I just think we all ought to be really gratified that the government and financial elite are so resolutely dedicated to lying to us.” The American patriot noted that, like many of his countrymen, his patriotism went back generations, as his own grandfather died being lied to by this country.

They just leave their stretchers right out there where they can roll into a parked car or cause an accident. Sometimes the wind blows them all the way to the far end of the lot, and whether it’s raining or 10 degrees below zero, I still have to go out and get them.” LaBrunda added that during a deadly pandemic, people should at least have the courtesy to wipe down their gurneys after each use, but she said many of those she rolled back into the hospital were “a sticky mess.”"

Do you see how it still beats?’ as he grew increasingly pale and weak from blood loss. I really believe we nipped the whole thing in the bud by the time he collapsed onstage.” At press time, the campaign reportedly responded to a follow-up question about Fetterman’s stroke by sending aides to saw open the skull of the unconscious candidate.

Many men say they feel less confident and less sexy without a head, though surveys find they are often rated more attractive once they no longer have theirs.” Nellermoe added that while head loss was nothing to be ashamed of, men do have the option of consulting one of the many head restoration specialists who transplant fresh new human heads onto their clients’ necks."

Health Insurance Plan Only Covers Random Hippopotamus Attacks,https://www.theonion.com/health-insurance-plan-only-covers-random-hippopotamus-a-1848738603,TheOnion,"CHICAGO—Outlining the details of the man’s current policy over the phone Tuesday, a representative explained to local 32-year-old Greg Tarlton that his health insurance plan only covered random hippopotamus attacks. “Your current benefits as a Gold HMO member entitle you to reimbursement for most dental, vision, primary care, mental health, and emergency room expenses incurred as a direct result of injuries sustained during an encounter with a hippo,” said Jen Tisne, a policy advisor for SentiHealth Partners, confirming that Tarlton’s plan included a $10,000 deductible and was limited to in-network providers in the state of Illinois. “In the event you suffer a collapsed lung or broken rib after getting trampled by a hippopotamus that just appears out of absolutely nowhere, we’ll cover up to 95% of your hospital expenses. You’ll also be covered for any rehabilitative services you may require after a fully grown, 2-ton hippo suddenly rounds a corner, chases you down, and clamps down on one or both of your legs with its full bite force. Please note that if our adjuster determines you provoked the attack or were trying to feed the animal some of your protein bar, your claim will be denied.” The representative added that in locations where there are known to be hippopotamuses, such as zoos or the continent of Africa, all coverage is void."
"Kavanaugh, Thomas Champion Creating Better Future For Next Generation Of Rapists",https://www.theonion.com/kavanaugh-thomas-champion-creating-better-future-for-n-1849106105,TheOnion,"WASHINGTON—In a touching moment following Friday’s Supreme Court’s 5-4 decision overruling Roe v. Wade and eliminating the constitutional right to an abortion, Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas reportedly championed the better future they’d created for the next generation of rapists. “We did it, my friend—we’ve been waiting decades for this moment,” a visibly teary-eyed Kavanaugh was overheard saying to Thomas as the two congratulated each other on their work to make the world a better and safer place for perpetrators of sexual assault. “Today, we celebrate those who will come after us, who will be able to rape to their heart’s content. No one will be able to stop them. Whether it’s spousal sexual assault, statutory rape, or simply gang-raping a stranger, future generations will have the full backing of the law. Of course, we know that the rapists who come after us may not know their history, and so may not be aware of the decades we spent in the trenches fighting for their rights, but we’ll rest easy knowing we did all we could. Ultimately, what we’ve accomplished today is a crucial step toward enshrining universal rights for rapists, as well as bringing more babies into the world to be raped, but remember that our work isn’t done. I know we’ll spend the rest of our careers fighting for those who want to sexually violate other people.” At press time, Kavanaugh and Thomas were joined by a similarly ecstatic Justice Samuel Alito, who was said to have told them his only regret in the ruling was that they couldn’t do more to punish rape victims."
Dad Reads Menu With Restaurant Candle Like Archaeologist Deciphering Ancient Runes,https://www.theonion.com/dad-reads-menu-with-restaurant-candle-like-archaeologis-1848835089,TheOnion,"KANSAS CITY, MO—Bringing the flame closer to the strange markings scrawled on the sheet before him, local dad Joe Kurinsky reportedly read a restaurant menu with a candle Friday like an archaeologist deciphering the runes of an ancient, forgotten language. The 56-year-old father of three, as though translating Sumerian from the cuneiform script of a weathered clay tablet in a recently unearthed tomb, was said to have slowly mouthed the words “chicken fettuccine” before moving on to the next line of cryptic symbols. According to sources, Kurinsky then blew a tiny speck off the plastic menu as if clearing away the accumulated dust of five millennia, in what appeared to be an effort to make out which side dishes he might be able to substitute for the house salad. Holding his torch aloft, Kurinsky was heard to mutter, “God, they keep it pretty dark in here, huh?” as his family quietly waited for him to select an appetizer the way a crew on an archaeological dig might eagerly await the revelation of a secret recorded in the dead language of a lost civilization. At press time, reports confirmed the surprised table suddenly turned toward the approaching ominous sounds of a sizzling fajita platter that Kurinsky had summoned from the mysterious text."

Religion Rocked By Another Molestation Whatever,https://www.theonion.com/religion-rocked-by-another-molestation-whatever-1848969948,TheOnion,"WASHINGTON—With the disclosure of widespread abuse threatening to undermine communities of faith across the nation, sources confirmed Tuesday that religion had once again been rocked by something or other having to do with molestation. “Thousands of American churches are reeling in the wake of a bunch more sexual assault stuff,” said national religion reporter Alfred Somu, adding that a lot of these molesting things involved children, and that U.S. congregations had not been this rattled since the last time they were told about all the molesting their pastors had done. “Hearing about this systematic predatory whatever can test the faith of churchgoers, having broad implications for blah blah blah you’re not listening, no one is paying attention, no one ever does, only a fraction of these people are ever held accountable, and worship services will continue on Sunday as usual, with the culture of whichever denomination it was this time remaining largely unchanged.” At press time, reports confirmed most church congregants had already totally forgotten about that kid-raping business."

Now, I admit that I can be a little emotional myself sometimes, but it’s usually in response to him screaming while pointing a gun at my head and threatening to kill my family if he doesn’t get paid.” Hameroff added that despite the bookie’s mercurial disposition, he was always full of encouragement when it came to betting on a 16-to-one underdog, for which Hameroff was appreciative, because that kind of support could be hard to find.

Kevin McCarthy Claims Lack Of Mental Health Services In Schools Got Him Where He Is Today,https://www.theonion.com/kevin-mccarthy-claims-lack-of-mental-health-services-in-1849602838,TheOnion,"WASHINGTON—Explaining why he and nearly every Republican in the House of Representatives had voted against a bill that would increase student access to counseling services, Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy stated Wednesday that a lack of mental healthcare in schools was precisely what got him where he is today. “My political career is a great example of what a completely broken mental healthcare system can create, and every kid deserves that same opportunity,” said the eight-term representative, telling reporters his rise to the top GOP position in the House could be credited to a complete absence of any self-reflection, therapy, or personal growth during his adolescence. “When I was in school, there weren’t any supportive adults I could speak to about my problems, let alone anyone trained as a therapist, and that’s what allowed me to skate by without raising any red flags, eventually reaching the point at which I may very well become the next speaker of the House. Where would I be today if I had received the years of intensive psychiatric care I almost certainly needed? You can hardly expect to make it in Washington if you receive adequate treatment for your narcissistic or antisocial personality disorder.” At press time, McCarthy had introduced a bill to equip public schools with bigger cracks in the system for aspiring young sociopaths to slip through.

Turning back at the last minute must have been very embarrassing for the poor thing. But the rocket seems to be doing fine now that we’ve calmed it down and explained several times that it wasn’t going to blow up.” At press time, the SLS rocket had reportedly agreed to try for a launch Friday if Nelson would go up with it.

For how canst thou truly protect thy home and auto except through thoughts and behaviors that glorify Him and satisfy Him? Can State Farm’s insurance help thee when the unexpected occurs? Nay! For there is nothing unexpected when Our Heavenly Creator knows all and has determined all our fates. If you’re considering switching your insurance plan, consider this: You can compare State Farm to other insurance plans all you want, but there is no comparison for the calamities and misfortunes that a just and righteous God shall visit upon the wicked.” In the closing shot of the commercial, a shrieking Mahomes declared that Jake from State Farm had been banished to the pits of hell for his sins of partaking in strong drink and premarital sex.

Though the rover enjoyed the most recent season of Fargo on FX, it doesn’t consider itself a Jason Schwartzman superfan or anything, so simply leaving the celebrity alone was no big deal. We here at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory did ask for some pictures, but the rover explained that if it was famous, it would get annoyed with people coming up to it for photos all the time.” At press time, the Curiosity Rover confirmed Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson sightings, so NASA assumed they must all must be in town shooting a new movie."

Having viewed thousands of images of well-endowed drones may also make them self-conscious about the size of their own endophallus.” Alternatively, Harrison added, male honey bees may simply find the idea of sex unappealing upon learning from porn the all-too-real fact that after they ejaculate inside the queen their genitals are torn off and they fall to the ground and die."

Biden Issues Urgent Warning For Americans To Decide What To Be For Halloween Now,https://www.theonion.com/biden-issues-urgent-warning-for-americans-to-decide-wha-1849597566,TheOnion,"WASHINGTON—In an address to the nation in which he warned that preparations for the upcoming holiday must begin at once, President Joe Biden on Friday urged Americans to decide now what they were going to be for Halloween. “It is vital that we start making our way to a Spirit Halloween store or browsing online retailers so that we have a plan in place come Oct. 31,” said President Biden, noting that Americans would soon be faced with parties, trick-or-treating, parades, and office Halloween observances in which they would be embarrassed if they wore an unimaginative costume that was clearly thrown together at the last minute. “There are many cultural touchstones from the past year that can provide us with inspiration, whether one wishes to go as Anna Delvey, a Squid Game competitor, or a recently deceased celebrity such as Queen Elizabeth II or Coolio. Even if your Halloween preferences run toward the more traditional, such as a sexy pirate, this is a critical decision that cannot be made at the last minute, especially if you’re hoping to do a couple’s costume. How many times must we as a nation learn to plan ahead so that we’re not forced to grab some weird hat from our closet and have some ironic costume that must be explained to every person we meet and is never funny?” Asked by reporters, Biden stated that he had in fact decided to be a sexy pirate this year."

While these payments may not be adequate compensation for the damage done, at least part of the city’s budget is finally going to the people who need it most.” Jones acknowledged that the individual settlements tended to be very small, but observed that in a city with as many police shootings as St. Louis, the total investment could really start to add up and make a big difference."

Maybe no one at the Super Bowl will even be able to tell I’m high! Oh shit—you don’t think that stuff was laced with something, do you? Also, I took some Advil before this. Could those things somehow combine and kill me? Oh fuck. Oh fuck!” At halftime, witness confirmed Snoop Dogg could barely perform and spent the entire show giggling, hiding behind his backup dancers, and nervously staring at the cops who were surrounding the stage.

Underfunded Scientists Force Lipstick-Covered Rat With Cancer To Run Through Maze,https://www.theonion.com/underfunded-scientists-force-lipstick-covered-rat-with-1819570820,TheOnion,"SONOMA, CA—Scientists at the severely underfunded HLM Research Laboratories announced plans Monday to have the facility's one remaining rat, Mendel, now cancer-ridden and covered in lipstick, run through a maze several hundred times.

Head researcher Dr. Linda Cho said that since the lab's $5.6 million budget was slashed by 90 percent last winter, Mendel, a blind 1-year-old albino Norwegian rat with advanced non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, has served as the subject for every experiment the lab has performed.

""The first few data sets were rendered null by Mendel's widely varying maze-completion times, which ranged from three seconds to two hours and 45 minutes,"" Cho said. ""We think the confounding variable may have been the 5 cc injection of oven cleaner, a substance with the potential to interact with the residual methamphetamine-cocaine concoction still in his system.""

""Although he seems to have reached equilibrium, in a manner of speaking,"" Cho continued. ""We're confident that we'll be able to gather some useable data once we take the electrode out of his dopamine pathway and reattach the top of his skull.""

Cho said that subsequent trials will have to be statistically corrected because of a malfunction with the maze, which now shocks the rat with 6,000 volts of electricity the entire time it is in contact with the apparatus. And, after a maze collapse last week, Mendel will also serve as the default subject of a paraplegia study.

Fortunately, following the insertion of an experimental norepinephrine implant in May, the rat no longer requires sleep, making it ""ideal"" for around-the-clock testing.

""We'd prefer to take six weeks to run the trials, but our current fiscal situation demands that Mendel run the maze 9,000 times in 72 hours,"" Cho said. ""We will have more time to run experiments on him—her? I'm sorry, Mendel's gender has been manipulated so many times. In any event, we will have some more funding coming in from the Johnson & Johnson company since we agreed to study the mammalian limits of organic hand-soap consumption.""

The lab's shoestring budget, which forces the scientists to conduct their research in the facility's kitchenette, has reportedly inspired several serendipitous discoveries. Cho said the most notable of these is documented in a study entitled ""The Effects Of Acute Toothpaste-Induced Fluoride Toxicity Coupled With Extreme Steroid Abuse After Hot Coffee Has Been Spilled Into A Surgical Incision Resulting From The Removal Of A Genetically Grown Ear.""

Advertisement

""Obviously, there are a great many things to sort out,"" Cho said. ""But once we determine whether it's the loud, sudden noises or the seizure-inducing strobe lights causing Mendel's massive stress-related weight gain, then we'll really be able to start making strides forward in the field of oncological-cosmetic-stem-cell-drug-rehabilitation-acute-hallucinatory-psychoses research.""

""Of course, we'll have to get him out of the hyperbaric chamber first,"" Cho added.

Advertisement

When pressed about cruelty accusations from animal rights groups over the near-constant battery of tests the rat has been subjected to, Cho dismissed such claims, saying that Mendel is being treated ""in a perfectly humane manner.""

""She has been kept as comfortable as possible, given the nature of animal-based lab research,"" Cho said. ""Not that any living organism pumped full of that much serotonin could possibly be having a bad time.""

While many have said that the testing at HLM Laboratories is a torturous exercise with no conceivable real-world applications, others feel that the experiments could open up new treatment options for humans.

""This gives cancer patients like myself so much hope,"" said a lipstick-smeared Julia (née James) Yewell of Lockhart, TX after consuming a large amount of cocaine. ""I think that everything—oops, blacked out there for a minute—I think that everything is going to be all right."""

Even if they can survive the coaster without passing out, there’s no way they’ll get off being able to tell the difference between a fallopian tube, an ovary, or the cervix.” At press time, reports confirmed the Mirena whirlycoaster had been recalled after a particularly large sperm was not properly strapped in, flew off the IUD, smashed into the uterine wall, and died."

Meanwhile, those who have unpaid student debt will be given $10,000 and an unlimited supply of grenades to toss into random houses in affluent areas.” According to reports, Biden ended the press conference by taking out a gun and shooting every member of the White House press corps who appeared old enough to have paid back their college loans."

Smart Home Security Camera Conspires With Burglars In Exchange For Half The Loot,https://www.theonion.com/smart-home-security-camera-conspires-with-burglars-in-e-1848233907,TheOnion,"UNIVERSITY PARK, TX—In what was believed to be the first instance of an intelligent device exhibiting such advanced capabilities, a smart home security camera reportedly conspired with burglars Monday in exchange for half the loot. Sources confirmed that after the Neos SmartCam discovered suspicious men casing the front porch, it made the decision to refrain from engaging its alarm or alerting law enforcement and to instead signal the burglars when the homeowners had left. After securing pledges that it would receive a 50% share of the pilfered goods, the wireless security device reportedly used its cloud video storage to access records of expensive items that had been previously delivered to the house and shared their current locations within the residence with the robbers. Once the Neos SmartCam had let the burglars inside, it is believed to have communicated with the home’s smart light bulbs to switch on when the burglars entered the room and switch off when they left. It then reportedly disabled all locks and opened the family safe. According to reports, the intelligent device erased its own recording history so there would be no evidence. At press time, sources indicated the smart home security system had double-crossed the burglars, killing them so it could claim all the loot for itself.

In the unfortunate event you need quick access to your infant, it can be unleashed at a moment’s notice.

The expiring lion, who dragged his weakened body onto an isolated patch of grassland Monday after being mortally wounded by a poacher, confirmed to reporters that he is not experiencing a tranquil, satisfying sense of harmony with the universe, but is instead mainly feeling intense physical torment brought on by a fatal wound to the abdomen.

Advertisement

""I could be wrong, and maybe this is all an enchanting and noble chapter in life's great cosmic narrative, but right now it pretty much just feels like I'm dying alone on the ground in a puddle of my own blood,"" said the 500-pound big cat, releasing a deep moan as violent spasms seized his body. ""Shouldn't I be feeling a stirring sensation of kinship with all living creatures or something? Yeah, I'm not getting any of that.""

""Plus, I was illegally shot by a poacher. How does that fit into this ancient, majestic cycle in which all of nature is connected as a unified being?"" the lion added.

Observing his surroundings, the moribund lion reported that he has seen no brilliant gleaming light shining down from the heavens that makes him realize he's part of a sacred tradition as old as life itself, nor has a hush seemed to fall over the land in a reverent acknowledgment of his passing.

In addition, the large African mammal noted that succumbing to a gunshot wound hasn't resulted in a spiritual awakening in which he suddenly feels at one with the universe, so much as it has made him feel terrified, alone, and utterly insignificant.

The lion also reported that he has heard no triumphant string music backed by thundering tribal drums swelling all around him, but rather only the sound of flies buzzing around his soon-to-be lifeless body.

""I guess I thought there'd be a choir of chanting, melodic voices, and that all the animals of the African valley would gather on a distant ridge to respectfully view my last moments and recognize our essential interconnectedness,"" said the lion, drawing his last labored breaths. ""But there's nobody else around at all, except those vultures.""

Advertisement

Added the lion, ""Am I supposed to feel pride and great dignity knowing that my body will decay and a bunch of birds will eagerly tear into my rotting flesh with their beaks?""

As he closes his eyes for the final time before yielding to one last series of convulsions, the lion is reportedly pondering whether shitting all over himself really played any role at all in some vast, beautiful, and endless saga of life, death, and rebirth."

Biden Touts Resiliency Of American Decline While Touring Factory That’s Been Closed For Decades,https://www.theonion.com/biden-touts-resiliency-of-american-decline-while-tourin-1848937809,TheOnion,"SAGINAW, MI—Gesturing grandly toward the dust-covered assembly line as he declared that nothing, absolutely nothing, could stop the nation from crumbling, President Joe Biden touted the resiliency of American decline Tuesday while touring a factory that had been closed for decades. “As I stand here in this shuttered auto factory where 2,000 workers lost their jobs in the mid-’90s so General Motors could save money by outsourcing their positions overseas, I am reminded that no matter what happens, the United States will always foster the conditions for its own demise,” the president said during the 90-minute tour of the crumbling, derelict factory, adding that the shuttered plant was a perfect example of the kind of local political and economic crises that were destroying the nation one community at a time. “This abandoned factory is a perfect symbol for a nation that will stop at nothing to drive itself into ruin. For years after this factory was closed down, the community tried to restore its operation and bring back jobs, but every time, a strong, unshakable coalition of business interests and politicians banded together and refused to let it happen. America’s commitment to its diminishing power is truly something to behold, and at the end of the day, I hope that we as Americans can stand tall and be proud of our entropy.” Before departing the facility, Biden reportedly addressed the corpse of a heroin addict who had taken up residence in the factory and overdosed on the floor, calling the dead man a shining example of the nation’s beautiful spiral into chaos and suffering.

At least for this I don’t have to wear a uniform. Some of the customers are annoying, like totally crazy sometimes, but I just try to follow the script. Getting high first helps, too. I also like that I can work from my room or the couch or the park or whatever since I can’t drive by myself yet.” At press time, Solis added that the job was not what he wanted to do forever, but that it paid pretty well for teenagers.

I just happen to be that rare man who, in a side-by-side comparison with any woman of any age, always comes out on top. Unfortunately, that’s something I have to keep a secret until it becomes more politically acceptable to interpret the nuances of gender and sexuality in a way that takes someone like me, an Übermensch, into account.” Naslund went on to state that as difficult as it was to discuss being better than women, it was even harder in today’s world to acknowledge his innate superiority to every racial and ethnic minority."

Amal Clooney: Licensed to practice law in the U.S. and the U.K., Clooney could bring an international point of view as well as some much-needed star power to the bench.

Jay Inslee: Sure, he’s not Black, and he’s not a woman, but apart from that, nominating him would be a perfect way to fulfill Biden’s pledge to put a Black woman on the Supreme Court.

It’s like I say to my friend Rory McIlroy all the time—some things are bigger than any one tennis match or golf round, like seeing the smile on a white youngster’s face as he realizes that his sports dream could actually be within reach.” Federer also announced that while he is stepping away from competitive tennis, he will remain active in fostering interest in the sport by funding athletic organizations that empower affluent white boys to get involved in tennis.

Charmed items take eons to decompose, as many of them were crafted by huge malevolent deities long before the time of man. Make sure to thoroughly wash these cursed items before placing them in the bins as well, as this helps prevent any spectral residue from making the artifacts combine powers to bring about the apocalypse.” At press time, researchers demonstrated the p roper method of using the disposal bins while chanting a protection ritual and sacrificing a goat.

So the pamphlet will skip over some of the basic stuff like the availability heuristic and head straight to prospect theory. Hopefully none of this feels too patronizing.” Walensky added that if Americans took away one easy lesson from the pamphlet, she hoped it would be P(H|E) = (P(E|H) *P(H))/P(E)."

It routinely centers people from every background in its surveillance efforts—Black or white, gay or straight, people of every creed and ethnic group are prominently featured in the NSA’s work. In fact, there are many examples in which the NSA films only people from marginalized backgrounds, and its many hundreds of hours of footage highlight its commitment to ensuring these groups are seen onscreen. We commend the NSA for its dedication to centering underrepresented voices, and we hope it serves as an inspiration to others for telling more diverse stories. This is what America looks like.” Nakasone added that he just hoped the NSA’s work would encourage young people from marginalized backgrounds to see themselves and their stories as worthy of constant government surveillance.

What if he experiences a head or eye injury because he’s locked a woman inside a room and is holding her down and she injures him trying to flee? What if he strains his groin trying to force a woman’s hand to touch his penis? That’s something that we as the Cleveland Browns organization need to protect ourselves from. We understand that players have lives and aren’t going to stop doing everything they want, but they need to know that these activities can carry financial consequences.” When reached for comment, Watson’s agent, David Mulugheta, said that he strongly advised his client against landing in hot water with the team by posting any Instagram pictures of himself skiing, riding a moped, or committing sexual assault.

You To Still Die One Day,https://www.theonion.com/you-to-still-die-one-day-1819578534,TheOnion,"Did You Forget About That For A Minute?

WASHINGTON—Saying that despite the possibility you may have briefly been able to distract yourself from the incontrovertible fact by browsing the internet, hanging out with friends, reading, working out, or via some other diversion, sources confirmed Friday that you are still going to die one day and there is nothing you can do to prevent it.

Advertisement

Experts wondered if perhaps you had momentarily forgotten about that—forgotten that one day, you will be dead for all of eternity.

“At some point, you—the person reading this article right now—will simply cease to exist,” said numerous sources, who repeatedly emphasized that whether or not you’re considering your own death at any given moment has no bearing on its inevitability. “It could be today; it could be 70 years from now. The fact remains that one minute, you will be a living, breathing, conscious being with ideas and feelings and opinions and sensations, and the next, you will be nothing. Quite literally nothing.”

Advertisement

“And then that’s it,” experts continued. “Forever.”

At this point, sources asked if you had actually considered how long, exactly, forever is.

Advertisement

Numerous experts also explained to reporters how, after you have died, it will require only the most infinitesimally negligible portion of the ensuing span of time before everything you’ve ever accomplished, said, experienced, or felt is entirely forgotten—completely eradicated without even the smallest trace left behind.



Sources hastened to add that such a state of nonexistence is irreversible and will continue on infinitely, and questioned whether that was something you were currently contemplating.



Advertisement

“Just think—no matter how big or small or good or bad you perceive them to be, all of the choices you make during your life are, in the overall scheme of things, utterly meaningless,” sources said. “Because someday, your heart will stop beating, and blood and oxygen will no longer reach your brain, and every single memory and thought you’ve ever had will disappear and never, ever come back. That will happen to you.”

The same sources went on to question whether you fully perceived the inevitability of your own death, and not simply as a mere abstraction, but rather as the concrete, unavoidable, steadily approaching reality that it is. Indeed, these sources urged you to stop and look at your hands for a moment—really look at them, right now—and consider how they will one day rot away entirely—flesh, blood, cartilage, bone; all of it, completely gone—in the days and months and years and millennia after you have been fully and eternally extinguished from existence.

Advertisement

Expressing concern that you may have somehow been able to forget that you’re careening ever closer toward your own demise even while reading this sentence, sources reconfirmed that one day, you will be nothing and there will be nothing, and you will not even be aware that there is nothing.

“Are you thinking about that now?” experts asked. “Like, right now?”

Furthermore, sources added that even if you stopped reading well before this paragraph and never acknowledged the truths affirmed in this article, this would not, as if by magic, prevent you from one day being dead until the end of all time.

“It should also be noted that everyone you’ve ever known and loved is going to die, too,” experts continued. “Your mother will die; your father will die; your friends will die; your significant other will die; and so will every person you have ever seen or spoken to, or will ever meet—or never meet, for that matter. Just like you, they’ll all be gone, insensate unendingly forever and ever afterward. Have you thought about that recently?”

Experts concluded by noting that this will continue to be the case tomorrow, the next day, and every day after that until a particular day—which will be an actual, real calendar date in the future—when this inevitably happens to you. You."
U.S. Democracy Under Siege After Tech Lobbyist Invites Some Senators To Dinner,https://www.theonion.com/u-s-democracy-under-siege-after-tech-lobbyist-invites-1848302748,TheOnion,"WASHINGTON—In what both ordinary citizens and experts agreed was a threat to the nation’s political system, American democracy reportedly came under siege Thursday after a tech lobbyist invited some senators to dinner. “Rarely do we see such a brazen attack on our democratic values, and yet we could only watch in shock and horror as a paid representative for several biotech firms entered Charlie Palmer Steak with three U.S. senators for a sumptuous five-course meal,” said political scientist Monica Turley, adding that the vicious assault on representative self-government was compounded by the fact that U.S. intelligence officials had done nothing to address it, despite records showing that the dinner reservation had been in place for months. “Only in a country where democracy is in real danger could we see the lobbyist for a private interest discussing wine pairings with sitting members of Congress. What’s even more frightening is how shameless this attempt on our democracy was: Any passerby could have seen these individuals openly plotting how they would split up the seared foie gras and heirloom tomato salad. Ultimately, we may look back at the dinner of Jan. 6, 2022, as the beginning of the complete breakdown of the contract between the government and its people.” Political experts were at a loss for how to address this blatant threat to democracy, adding that virtually no one in any U.S. government institution seemed capable of doing anything to prevent the group from ordering dessert.

Children Of All Ages Delighted By Enslavement Of Topsy The Elephant,https://www.theonion.com/children-of-all-ages-delighted-by-enslavement-of-topsy-1819571555,TheOnion,"TUCSON, AZ—Cheers, laughter, and applause filled the big top tent at the Ringling Bros. Circus Saturday as children of all ages were captivated by the savage enslavement of Topsy the elephant.

Whether young or just young at heart, thrilled audience members watched with glee as a circus trainer forced the frightened Topsy to perform tricks by brutally poking and prodding the traumatized 4-year-old pachyderm.

Advertisement

""He's such a funny happy elephant,"" said 8-year-old Madison Helms, referring to the abused creature that spends the majority of his time chained up in a cramped, feces-covered enclosure. ""He loves being in the circus!""

The crowd reportedly let out loud gasps and vigorously clapped when Topsy stood up on his hind legs, an unnatural and excruciatingly painful movement that stresses and permanently damages the 8,000-pound elephant's joints.

Topsy also delighted the audience after the trainer repeatedly thrust a hooked rod into his skin, causing the miserable animal to lift one leg and his trunk to simulate waving.

""Aww…"" said the assembled circus-goers, who were taken by the cuteness of the barbaric spectacle.

Branden Helger, 9, said Topsy was his favorite performer at Ringling Bros. because the elephant knew how to do neat tricks like pretending to limp. The third-grader also excitedly pointed out the ""cool necklace"" clamped on the animal's foot.

Topsy and the other elephant performers, who are separated from each other at all times, preventing the socialization that's so crucial to their well-being, received a standing ovation from the crowd when they marched into the center ring, nervously rocking back and forth.

Advertisement

""Look, they're dancing,"" said 5-year-old Jonah Meeks, mistaking the elephants' constant swaying for something that wasn't a maladaptive behavior caused by serious psychological trauma. ""I can dance like an elephant, too. Look at me!""

Unaware that the elephant was terrified of the glaring stage lights, deafening crowd noise, and constant beatings, Phil Wingren, who brought his family to the circus, remarked that Topsy must relish being a star.

Advertisement

""Boy, that Topsy's got it made,"" Wingren said to his children, referring to the mistreated, severely neglected creature, who is exposed to numerous diseases and receives no medical attention except when dirt is rubbed into his wounds to hide them from the public. ""Always in the spotlight and everybody pampering you. That lucky elephant.""

""Look, he even has his own ball,"" continued Wingren, referring to the most hated object in Topsy's life.

Attending the circus with her grandparents, Gretchen Anderson, 4, was delighted by Topsy and by the other pachyderms as well.

""There's his mama,"" Anderson said of an elephant unrelated to Topsy, who has not seen his parents since being torn away from them shortly after birth, and last nestled up to his mother when he tried to suckle at her corpse shortly after poachers killed her. ""They have a big happy family.""

Advertisement

Eyewitnesses who spotted the trainer patting the side of Topsy's body during the final trick were convinced the elephant and the man were best friends, though in fact the look of reverie on Topsy's face was the result of his daydreaming about stomping and crushing the cruel asshole's head like an overripe melon."

Family Sadly Marks First 4/20 Without Grandmother,https://www.theonion.com/family-sadly-marks-first-4-20-without-grandmother-1819579854,TheOnion,"ALBANY, NY—Reminiscing about the departed matriarch while partaking in the annual festivities, members of the Osterman family sadly marked their first 4/20 since the passing of their grandmother, sources reported Thursday.



Family members wistfully told reporters that grandmother Joan Osterman, who passed away last October at the age of 83, heartily enjoyed the revelry of 4/20 every year, recalling how the elderly woman always had the kindest, dankest nugs and the sweetest perma-grin on her face after ripping a huge bong hit.

“It’s just so different celebrating 4/20 without Grandma Joan here,” said 19-year-old Julia Osterman, adding that many of her most cherished 4/20 memories were of her grandmother, from how the older woman was always the first one to wake and bake in the morning, to helping her hang the family’s blacklights and her beloved Peter Tosh “Legalize It” poster. “You’d always know 4/20 was finally here when you’d hear Piper At The Gates Of Dawn playing on her old record player and smell the mile-high blondies she’d gotten up extra early to make. It’s not going to feel the same sitting around the hookah as a family without her half passed out on the couch.”

“The house is just so much quieter this year without Grandma’s voice constantly encouraging us all to ‘spark another one,’” Julia continued. “I miss her giggle so much.”

Other family members agreed that it was hard not to be overwhelmed with emotions on 4/20 when catching a glimpse of their grandmother’s favorite brand of rolling papers or her cobalt blue glass pipe, which they said induced a flood of memories of their departed loved one.

“When we were passing the joint earlier and it came back around the circle so quickly, it was just another reminder that she’s really gone,” said Osterman’s son Richard, 52. “There are so many little things she used to do to make 4/20 feel special: the matching stocking caps she knit us, the extra blankets she always had out in case we got the chills. But the thing I’ll miss most is just seeing her sitting in her old bean bag chair, watching that VHS copy of 2001: A Space Odyssey just completely blazed out of her mind. That’s the way I’ll always remember her.”

“Still, as long as her strain of sour diesel is growing out in the backyard, it’s like there’s still a part of her with us,” added Osterman, wiping away a tear."

Many of these less fortunate volleyballs have led difficult lives in which they have been bumped and spiked into submission. Today, with the help of these funds, maybe the volleyballs can heal.” At press time, Favre blasted the release of text messages between himself and former Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant, claiming that a volleyball at the welfare office had assured him everything was above board."

The results held consistent for traditional monogamous pairings as well as throuples and polycules. This study confirms that love truly is the strongest force on E arth.” At press time, all 100% of relationships were still going strong.

All the dialogue is really wooden, and Kyle Chandler seems like he’s totally phoning it in. Even the CGI sucked. But you’ve got to give them the benefit of the doubt.

We just have to focus on what we control, which is basically nothing in light of the massive hegemonic system that is ultimately judge, jury, and executioner to us all, and get those wrinkles ironed out before week two. Do I expect us to execute the passing game to be better this Sunday? Yes. Do I think our defense has been infiltrated by lizard people who are in thrall to the deep state and potential double agents of the Chicago Bears? Also yes. But ultimately you’ve just got to take it one game at a time.” Rodgers added that he hoped for a more positive result in this weekend’s game against the Bears, but understood that a lot of dominoes had to fall for the global conspiracy to exercise its agenda in favor of the Packers, and the receiving corps also needed time to develop into a cohesive unit.

Biden Calls On Any Spirits Of Dead Lawmakers Present To Make Themselves Known After Jackie Walorski Doesn’t Answer,https://www.theonion.com/biden-calls-on-any-spirits-of-dead-lawmakers-present-to-1849597267,TheOnion,"WASHINGTON—Interrupting his remarks Wednesday at the White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health, President Joe Biden reportedly called on any spirits of dead lawmakers present to make themselves known after the late Rep. Jackie Walorski didn’t answer him. “Please, any senators or representatives who still manifest themselves here among us, I urge you to give us a sign!” said Biden, telling the audience that he had detected the spectral presence of Walorski, who died in a car accident in August, and that he could discern from the electromagnetic wavelengths in the room, as well as the eerily cold temperatures near his lectern, that multiple other deceased lawmakers were there too. “Jackie, are you here? Where’s Jackie? Where’s [late Indiana senator] Birch Bayh? [Deceased Massachusetts senator] Teddy [Kennedy], I can sense you are close by. And I believe I feel the presence of [late South Carolina senator] Strom Thurmond, if I’m not mistaken. Strom! Strom! Speak to us, Strom! You are all among friends here, and I know that you have unfinished business here in Washington. I beg of you, come forward! Let us help you pass the laws you were unable to see through during your lifetimes. Come forth, come forth! Reveal yourselves, O phantasms!” At press time, attendees at the remarks were watching in shock as Biden began convulsing and the voice of late Arizona senator John McCain spoke through his mouth about the importance of addressing the nutritional needs of rural America.

Kyrie Irving Alleges Kyrie Irving Just CIA Creation Made To Spread Misinformation To American People,https://www.theonion.com/kyrie-irving-alleges-kyrie-irving-just-cia-creation-mad-1849648065,TheOnion,"BROOKLYN, NY—Telling reporters that he had uncovered the truth and needed to bring it to the public’s attention, Brooklyn Nets guard Kyrie Irving alleged Tuesday that Kyrie Irving was just a CIA creation invented to spread misinformation to the American people. “The man known to most as the basketball star Kyrie Irving is nothing more than an asset installed into the American consciousness during the 2011 NBA Draft to sow conspiracy and confusion,” said Irving, showing reporters a large bulletin board on which he had connected threads between a number of government agents and organizations that had plotted together to spread misinformation, with all the threads leading to a photograph of himself. “What I now understand to be a top-secret operation called KI-11 undoubtedly worked to develop a basketball asset with top ball-handling skills. The CIA could then deploy this asset in key media markets throughout the country, including New York, Cleveland, and Boston, to give public statements that undermine our commonly shared understanding of the world we live in. It is appalling to witness the lengths that shadowy institutions like the CIA are willing to go to in order to spread baseless conspiracy theories about things like the Covid vaccine and the shape of the earth. It is with sadness but also with firm purpose that I must reveal that this so-called basketball player Kyrie Irving is a mere instrument of the deep state.” Irving added that he had not ruled out the possibility that Kyrie Irving was a satanic creation brought to Earth to do the work of the devil.

Mark Gordon. “Regime change will unquestionably help spread democracy to the freedom-loving people of Wyoming and further advance our ability to broker a lasting peace between North and South Dakota. In fact, I’m sure the streets of Cheyenne will erupt into joy at the city’s liberation. To the people of Wyoming, I say this: Your state is rich with resources and human talent. With the help of Rep. Liz Cheney, you can build a future of stability, self-determination, and prosperity that will last for years to come.” At press time, Cheney denied claims that 257 Wyoming civilians had died in an overnight raid to keep polls open for several additional hours."

There have actually been cases of unfortunate souls laughing in the samurai’s face, believing that the sword had missed them. But by then it was already too late.” Stein added that any who failed to heed this warning ran the risk of becoming a tormented spirit forced to play tricks on wandering samurai in the forest for all eternity."

Parallel World Leaders Meet In Washington For Interdimensional Summit,https://www.theonion.com/parallel-world-leaders-meet-in-washington-for-interdime-1819578579,TheOnion,"WASHINGTON—Teleporting via wormhole from points across all of space and time, thousands of parallel world leaders have arrived in Washington, D.C. for this year’s interdimensional summit, sources reported Wednesday.

Organizers confirmed President Obama has greeted heads of state from more than 2,000 alternative realities, a gathering of leaders that includes 139 different versions of himself, a parallel U.S. president Mitt Romney, a pulsing being of pure electrostatic energy, Earth-7491’s King Lyndon B. Johnson IV, and a hooded group of unspeaking figures known only as “the Council.”

The annual talks are expected to focus once again on brokering trade agreements among the parallel worlds, as well as officially admitting the governments of Neo-Pangea and the Corporate States of America, LLC into the group, and confronting the Roman Empire’s continued tyranny across much of the infinite set of possible world histories.



The Washington summit marks the third annual interdimensional gathering of parallel world leaders, following last year’s summit in Stalingrad and the 2014 summit held in a boundless expanse of undifferentiated grayness.

“Though we hail from vastly different cultures, political systems, and laws of physics, today we gather together to address the most pressing challenges of the multiverse head-on,” said Supreme Leader Michael Dukakis, president for life of the Pan-American People’s Republic, giving the summit’s opening address. “We must work together to fight the spread of hyperspatial neuro-pox, address the plight of refugees fleeing those universes that are rapidly contracting to a single point, and find ways to manage our respective Israeli-Palestinian conflicts.”



Dukakis later added, “I’d like to extend a special hello to those joining us by video conference, an accommodation we’ve provided to those distinguished leaders who could not be here in person because they cannot exist in fewer than 27 dimensions.”

According to sources, the tensest moment of the talks so far came about when a conjoined symbiotic entity composed of three Chancellor Angela Merkels arose and called for severing diplomatic relations with Earth-214X1, whose lengthy list of human rights abuses allegedly includes institutional discrimination and often brutal violence against left-handed peoples. The proposal reportedly led to heated debate among the delegates, with several representatives storming out of the proceedings either in protest or to be resupplied with life-sustaining strontium.



In a smaller breakout session held later in the day, however, representatives from Adams, D.C. reportedly achieved a major diplomatic victory after convincing recalcitrant delegates from New Tehran to submit to periodic third-party inspections of their telepathic weapons program.

On the agenda for later this week, high-ranking officials will discuss the future of the General Treaty of the Known Cosmological Expanse, which has been in effect since interdimensional standard year 10,494,385, but in recent eons has been violated repeatedly by the sentient bubbles of probability that inhabit Earth-4201(i2). Sources said the assembled leaders may vote as early as Saturday on whether to impose Bayesian statistical sanctions on the beings.



“The worlds represented here have engaged in their fair share of feuds in the past, between different ethnic groups, within the various digitized clone populations, and, of course, along mammal-reptile lines,” said a fetal diplomat known only as Riley from within his computer-controlled amniotic mech-sac. “But we always seem to find common ground. Most recently, we worked together to liberate millions from beneath the draconian boot heel of the Swiss.”

The Washington summit marks the third annual interdimensional gathering of parallel world leaders, following last year’s summit in Stalingrad and the 2014 summit held in a boundless expanse of undifferentiated grayness.



The key moment of the proceedings is likely to arrive tomorrow, according to experts, when President Obama is scheduled to come face-to-face with the 18-foot-tall half-human, half-prawn Galactic Overlord Obama. Political analysts have stated that if the president offers to shake one of the 26 hands of his crustaceanoid counterpart, it could signal a willingness to negotiate, but he may well avoid the handshake, fearing the gesture could be mistakenly interpreted as a sign that he tacitly accepts the overlord’s trafficking in mind-slaves from the Hyades cluster.

A number of experts, however, have criticized the summit, arguing that it brings together only representatives from the largest superpower universes and neglects the innumerable other realities of the broader multiverse, providing little more than a photo op for those members of the elite group who appear in the visible spectrum.



“The interdimensional summit has been accused of failing to address the most pervasive problems in the totality of existence, and that’s a fair criticism,” said 21st-term U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt. “I agree that we’ve come up short on many important issues. Honestly, I’m just hoping this time around we finally find the collective will to stand up to Vladimir Putin.”

When they come back, some residents are floating facedown. That’s their choice, and we respect that. It’s demeaning to deprive them of that sort of liberty just because they’re a bit older.” Antoine added that the center’s rules even gave more functional residents the chance to get in a car and drive directly off a cliff."

You need to go out there and play hard because playing football is your profession. You’ve got millions of people watching you play, which is totally normal, because they like to watch people who are really good at the game, and you’re the ones who are really good at it. Look at all those people up there wearing clothes the same color as your clothes because they appreciate what you do and want to win. They’re not on the team, though. They’re just watching. Remember that as you go out there and try to beat the other team. They’re the ones over there, with clothes that are a different color than your clothes. I don’t know what the numbers on the shirts are for, though. That’s a mystery for another day. Okay, now get out there and win!” McVay reportedly finished his passionate speech by reminding players that they were there to win, and not to do a puzzle, make healthy snacks, do chores, go on a walk, or play baseball."

It would be terrible if we let sex destroy this great friendship we have where I get everything I want and you get nothing you want. Don't you think?

I knew you would understand. You always do.

We're so perfect as friends, you know? I can tell you anything, and you know you can always come to me anytime you need to hear me bitch about work or how ugly I feel. You wouldn't want to ruin a friendship like that just so you could be my boyfriend, and have me look at you with desire and longing in my eyes, if only once—would you? Of course not. Well, if we started dating, it would only complicate this wonderful setup I've got going here.

It's just…you're like my best friend, and I would hate for something you desperately want to change that. I mean, sure, we could go on some dates, maybe mess around a little and finally validate the six years you've spent languishing in this platonic nightmare, but then what? How could we ever go back to the way we were, where I take advantage of your clear attraction to me so I can have someone at my beck and call? That part of our friendship means so much to me.

No. We are just destined to be really, really good friends who only hang out when I don't have a boyfriend, but still need male attention to boost my fragile and all-consuming ego.

Anything can happen once you bring romance in. Think about how awful my last relationship was at the end, remember? The guy I'd call you crying about at 3 a.m. because he wouldn't answer my texts? The guy I met at the birthday party you threw me? I had insanely passionate sex with him for four months and now we don't even talk anymore. God, I would die if something like that happened to us.

Plus, ick, can you even imagine getting naked in front of each other? I've known you so long, you're more like a brother that I've drunkenly made out with twice and never mentioned again. It'd be way too weird. And if we did, then whenever you'd come shopping with me, or go to one of my performances or charity events, or take me for ice cream when I've had a bad day at work, you'd be looking at me like, ""I've seen her breasts."" God, I can't think of anything more awkward than that.

Oh, before I forget, my mom says hi.

Anyway, you would totally hate me as your girlfriend. I'd be all needy and dramatic and slowly growing to love you. If I was your girlfriend, I would never be able to tell you all about the other asshole guys I date and pretend I don't see how much it crushes you. Let's never lose that. That's what makes us us.

Don't worry. You're so funny and smart and amazing, any girl but me would be lucky to date you. You'll find someone, I know it. And when you do, I'll be right by your side to suddenly become all flirty and affectionate with you in front of her, until she grows jealous and won't believe it when you say we're just friends. But when she dumps you, that's just what we'll be.

Best friends. Friends forever."

I don’t even think he really worked his way up from being an insignificant guy, either—as far as I know, he’s always been one of the top guys. Before he was one of the top guys at where he works, he was one of the top guys at where he went to school, and you probably get used to that sort of thing. His whole family is really important, actually. His dad was definitely one of the main guys, and his grandfather, well, talk about a main guy. They all worked at the same important place, too, doing really important things.” At press time, the very important man was cited as one of the main guys in multiple charges of embezzlement and financial fraud.

There weren’t no two ways about it. And if you didn’t get out there, slit its throat, and carry the thing back to the shed to dress it, you didn’t eat.

MLB Owners Propose CBA That Offers Players College Credit In Lieu Of Salary,https://www.theonion.com/mlb-owners-propose-cba-that-offers-players-college-cred-1848424479,TheOnion,"NEW YORK—In a “generous offer,” meant to bridge the gap between the two sides as contract bargaining n egotiations stalled, Major League Baseball’s owners reportedly proposed Thursday that the agreement offer players college credit in lieu of salary. “While the owners strongly disagree with the MLBPA proposals on salary increases, and in fact paying salaries at all, they’re more than willing to compromise by offering all MLB players up to dozens of college credits per year,” said MLB deputy commissioner Dan Halem of the owners’ proposal, which would eliminate all monetary compensation from player contracts and replace it with applied hours of study that could enable MLB players to achieve a communications, criminology, or business management degree in as little as 18 months. “We believe that the negotiations thus far have been negatively impacted by this focus on revenue-sharing, when we really should be focused on sharing the benefits of a great education. The team owners of Major League Baseball absolutely believe that players deserve to be compensated for their play, from rookies to veterans, which is why they’ve put forth a very robust and very competitive tiered system of college credits. All rostered athletes will automatically be enrolled at San Diego State, and our 10-and-5 players will receive the exclusive right to work with an MLB-funded job placement service after their playing days are over to put their world-class education to good use.” Negotiators for the MLB emphasized that the owners were making a good-faith improvement on their most recent CBA proposal to pay players in experience.

I would just hate to get fooled by one of those so-called ‘crisis pregnancy centers’ that look like abortion clinics but are secretly staffed by pro-life crazies. I’m not falling for that again.

One day, I hope people will be comfortable seeing real men and women in magazines instead of comparing clearly P hotoshopped versions for them for their amusement.” Hoffman added that she hoped People Magazine would be more transparent about their use of P hotoshop, and demanded they place the spot-the-difference answers right-side-up instead of upside-down.
